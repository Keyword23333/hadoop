5230012 when you take into consideration oil has fallen over 40 a barrel it is clearly obvious the savings have not been passed on to country motorists

5230025 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world

5230051 the uk housing event is probably second only to the japanese 1990 land bubble in the real estate bubble hall of fame uk house prices could easily decline 50pc from the peak and at that lower level they would still be higher than they were in 1997 as a multiple of income
5230052 if prices go all the way back to trend and history says that is extremely likely then the uk financial system will need some serious bail outs and the global ripples will be substantial

5230080 he never tried to create an impression in pakistan that we were fighting for our own country and our own good
5230081 and because of that the pakistan army became a client army and pakistan became a client state in the eyes of the people it was a major failing on his part
5230082 and he didnt understand that a country of 160 million people couldnt be ruled by just one man

5230147 successivamente prosegue capodanno mi sono allontanato ritornando sui luoghi dopo un paio dore e notando con profonda meraviglia e delusione che nulla era cambiato dal momento che i parcheggiatori stavano ancora tutti al loro posto compreso quello che si trovava nei pressi della mia autovettura continuando tranquillamente a svolgere la loro attivit abusiva

5230207 es war ganz offensichtlich da eine umfangreiche liquidierung von papierwerten stattfinden und au erdem eine nderung in der geistigen einstellung der bev lkerung vor sich gehen mu te die vom gedanken der spekulation als grundlage des lebensunterhalts und des nationalen fortschritts wie besessen war
5230208 den kongress darum zu ersuchen auf dem b rsenmarkt einzugreifen war aussichtslos auf jeden fall h tte es auch eine ausweitung der macht des pr sidenten ohne verfassungm ige grundlage bedeutet wenn er die aktienkurse diktiert h tte
5230209 ich beschlo daher mir die unterst tzung des federal reserve systems zu sichern
5230210 um die ffentlichkeit zur vorsicht zu mahnen lie ich mir die herausgeber und verleger der bedeutenden zeitungen und zeitschriften einzeln kommen und forderte sie auf systematisch das land vor der spekulation und den unangemessen hohen aktienkursen zu warnen die meisten von ihnen entsprachen auch meinem wunsch mit scharfen leitartikeln dies hatte jedoch keine sp rbare wirkung
5230211 finanzminister mellon und andere gaben auf mein ersuchen hin wiederholt erkl rungen ab in denen sie die ffentlichkeit aufforderten ihre aktien in obligationen umzuwandeln und andere vorsichtsma nahmen vorschlugen auch dies zeitigte keinen erfolg
5230212 aber die new yorker bankiers machten sich alle ber den gedanken lustig da der markt nicht
5230213 meine dritte bem hung bestand darin mir richard whitney den pr sidenten der new yorker b rse kommen zu lassen und ihn aufzufordern die b rse selber solle die manipulierung von aktien eind mmen mr whitney war zwar freigebig in seinen versprechungen unternahm jedoch nichts
5230214 zwischen gouverneur young vom direktorium der federal reserve und einigen gro banken erhob sich ein streit ob man um die spekulation abzubremsen die diskonts tze heben sollte oder nicht gouverneur young behauptete die erh hung der diskonts tze w rde den banken lediglich gr ere gewinne eintragen sich auf das gesch ftsleben jedoch wie eine strafe auswirken er vertrat den standpunkt die banken k nnen kredite f r spekulationen dadurch eind mmen da sie es ganz einfach ablehnten solche kredite zu vergeben
5230215 er gab den reserve banken die anweisung solchen banken die rediskontierung zu verweigern die weitgehend kredite f r aktiengesch fte hergaben sie verfuhren dabei so dass sie ihre handelswechsel zur rediskontierung bei den reserve banken vorlegten und dann die gewinne auf dem markt einsetzten es gab einen zeitpunkt bei dem die ma nahmen des direktoriums der federal reserve die zinsen f r spekulationsgelder bis auf 20 j hrlich hinaufschraubten aber leute die von einem hundertprozentigen gewinn in der woche tr umten lie en sich von einem zinssatz von 20 prozent im jahr nicht abschrecken
5230216 mr young konnte voll und ganz nachweisen wie hoffnungslos die vorstellung sei auf der man das federal reserve system gegr ndet hatte da es n mlich j he aufw rtsbewegungen unter kontrolle halten k nne die kontrolle ber den zinsfu stellt jedenfalls kein machtmittel dar wenn die allgemeinheit erst einmal von geldgier ergriffen ist und sich ber nacht ein verm gen ertr umt als sei sie im besitz von aladins wunderlampe sind so geringf gige mittel wie die festlegung des zinssatzes wirkungslos

5230242 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
5230243 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far

5230246 cost segregation is a powerful and necessary part of accurately calculating depreciation for real property

5230251 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
5230252 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
5230253 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
5230254 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
5230255 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
5230256 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
5230257 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
5230258 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
5230259 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5230260 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
5230261 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
5230262 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
5230263 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5230264 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
5230265 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
5230266 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
5230267 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
5230268 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
5230269 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
5230270 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
5230271 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
5230272 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
5230273 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
5230274 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
5230275 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
5230276 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
5230277 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
5230278 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
5230279 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving

5230281 why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
5230282 the following drivers were less likely to honk than when a cheaper older car was doing the blocking
5230283 drivers in new york surrounded by millions of strangers are likely to honk more and sooner than a driver in a small town in idaho where a care that has not moved might not be a nuisance but the stalled vehicle of a friend
5230284 though women were just as likely to visibly express anger

5230288 warman missed the 90 day deadline for mediation and 30 days after the 150 day case deadline he was served with a 45 day notice of dismissal for abandonment
5230289 now finally warmans lawyers have set the matter down for trial
5230290 the combined case with warman and kinsella is getting just as bad they havent even filed their affidavits of documents
5230291 one would expect that two people who are allegedly so worried about their reputations that they are driven to sue us would be chomping at the bit to get to court and get this thing resolved instead they are missing deadlines in the procedure they themselves chose

5230299 the scouts went all out for michael and we are all very proud of them
5230300 we raised almost 25 000 from the scout teams who has gone around town raising money from merchants and friends said scoutmaster brad mead of troop 175 the organizer of the race the team of cortland carter mike vallen and keegan rice raised over 5 000 themselves in the month before the race many other teams raised well over a 1 000 the community really came together for mike due to the extensive press coverage which included stories about the adventure race in the simsbury post hartford courant on the local radio stations and even the chicago tribune i have been receiving checks in the mail every day from all over the country
5230301 the adventure race had two goals to raise much needed money for michael bubnash and to raise the level of scouting awareness in simsbury both goals were accomplished

5230339 if this unethical behaviour by microsoft was not sufficiently despicable they did the unthinkable by involving politics in what should have been a technical evaluation of the standard by writing to the head of the malaysian standards organization and getting its business partners to engage in a negative letter writing campaign to indicate lack of support of odf in the malaysian market

5230346 we seem intent on fostering the myth that the internet is the province of the young that online is an ineffective way to reach boomers particularly older boomers and you might as well forget social media when thinking about older consumers and nothing could be farther from the truth
5230347 apparently the blogger is unaware that most boomers are still active in the workforce the oldest are 62 youngest 44 with a probable majority familiar with computers and the distances they cover he probably doesnt know either that people 65 and older are going online in record numbers which does necessarily involve use of a computer
5230348 as i have said before in this space i have fathered 3 boomers 2 gen xers and 1 millennial as expected they are all different but at the same time they all went through the same stages with pretty much the same worldviews and very much the same needs and as i have also said in this space the partitioning of the population into generational groupings is fraught with peril

5230407 we collected allot of information for trarc and eventually made our way back to the tahuayo lodge where we finally got to dry out and get a cold shower of river water our guides asked us to play their village in a game of soccer and we agreed and got beaten solidly by the locals they toured us through their thatched hut village and we got to see a very different way of life
5230408 georgien wird ein mitglied der nato wenn es will und eben das will georgien
5230409 zwei flugstunden von wien entfernt lassen sich in diesen tagen die grundrisse einer neuen friedensordnung betrachten am ostrand europas ist die pax russa aufgetaucht der diktatfrieden den moskau nun seiner fr heren sowjetrepublik georgien aufdr ckt k nnte ihr erster teil sein pax russa war bisher ein begriff den vor jahren allenfalls kritiker von russlands vernichtungsfeldzug gegen die tschetschenen und deren rebellen verwendeten seit der besetzung georgiens vor mehr als einer woche ist der russische frieden aber eine drohung f r europa und die usa geworden allumfassend gaslieferungen ebenso infrage stellend wie demokratische wahlen justizermittlungen wie im fall des in london ermordeten ex agenten litwinenko oder das recht auf souver ne au enpolitische entscheidungen
5230410 russland hat bewiesen dass es im kaukasus konflikt herr der lage ist mit dem abzug seiner truppen aus georgien l sst moskau sich zeit bis es ihm genehm ist damit best tigt sich der eindruck dass die doktrin der einflusszonen aus der zeit des kalten kriegs wieder neu in kraft tritt russland l sst keinen zweifel daran dass es in der krise nach eigenem gutd nken agiert der nato bermittelt es damit die botschaft russlands kaukasischer hinterhof ist allein eine angelegenheit moskaus die europ er wurden von moskau als vermittler akzeptiert aber sie spielten nur eine untergeordnete rolle
5230411 man kann sich vorstellen dass die russischen f hrer dmitri medwedew und wladimir putin zufrieden ber all diese diplomatischen bem hungen sind georgien wieder zur ruhe zu bringen zum berw ltigenden russischen sieg ber die georgischen streitkr fte kommt die gewissheit den schl ssel zu einer l sung im kaukasus zu besitzen und damit die bem hungen der staaten des ostens um eine diplomatische emanzipation zu verh hnen selbst wenn jetzt wirklich ein waffenstillstand eintritt der von einer internationalen friedenstruppe garantiert wird und selbst wenn die humanit re hilfe ossetien erreichen kann so bleiben doch die dem tigung der niederlage und ein immer radikalerer r ckzug auf die ethnischen identit ten dem tigung und ethnischer hass sind ein fruchtbarer boden f r den krieg in europa wie anderswo das sollte russland bei allem stolz auf seine so sp rbar wiedergewonnene internationale autorit t nicht vergessen

5230416 well remembering tiananman square and the cultural revolution theres more evil to chinas police activities than makes me comfortable but im sure theres good mixed in there as well
5230417 my own feeling about this is that its normal segway has marketed to security forces since the beginning it is a tool and it can and should be used in anyway that is effective in fighting crime and ensuring safety you can attach politics to it if you want but any other country or security forces including our own would be smart to develop tactics to take advantage of the segway abilities
5230418 i suppose its supposed to look scary and i guess it sort of does but if i were one of those guys the first thing id do is get off lay the segway down and get behind it and hope the saphion batteries are as safe as they claim or stick on a skidplate as armor

5230421 most people dont realize the vulnerability of victims to identity theft in the wake of a disaster like the deadly tornadoes that struck tennessee on february 5 2008 important documents can be scattered for miles and can end up in the wrong hands
5230422 in just a matter of minutes thousands of people can become compromised and many will never know it until its too late
5230423 we are proud to be forming this partnership with the american red cross
5230424 victims of such disasters need to have the peace of mind that namesafe can offer during that critical time immediately following the event that leads to the compromise of personal information they need to know that their identity is safe and that there is someone there to help them if it ends up in the wrong hands

5230426 pilot mark believes the myth that the plane will be held in place by the belt
5230427 additionally the obvious intention of the myth is to give a clear difference in the possible outcomes either it flies or it is held stationary and measuring the speed relative to the ground will never give this clear difference even a car will achieve a speed relative to the ground of half the speed shown on its speedometer so much so that if a plane was fitted with wings which caused it to take off at 50mph it could achieve a speed of 100mph on the speedometer and it would take off

5230461 as you know ican is the only professional accountancy body in nigerian recognized by the international federation of accountants ifac the global body that regulates the accountancy profession in 120 countries of the world
5230462 one of the undertakings signed by virgin airlines is that it would not do or permit to be done anything which would violate nigerian laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to matters of strategic security and economic interest of the federal republic of nigeria
5230463 you now ask yourself what then is the basis of all the noise the airline is making
5230464 that is why our oil industry remains what it is today since most of the contracts were written by the multinational oil companies to the detriment of the nation and our officials merely signed
5230465 the truth is that virgin has no valid legal claim to operate from the international airport terminal and no amount of propaganda and campaign will work the management of the airlines just have to obey the federal governments order by moving their operations to where others are operating from it is as simple as that
5230466 there are some false assumptions on bakassi the first is that the local government no longer exists and that there are now 773 councils in nigeria and on that i have read some commentaries suggesting that there is a breach of the constitution that is not true because only some territories were ceded to cameroon so bakassi local government still exists which means the constitutional issue does not arise
5230467 which cameroon itself is aware of as they did not get what they wanted with respect to the oil rich off shore area
5230468 so economically nigeria lost pretty little but losing any piece of land is not always palatable so in that respect it is painful
5230469 another assumption is that the federal government ceded the territory to please some western powers
5230470 the green tree agre ement gta which president olusegun obasanjo signed and for which he should be commended actually gave more territories to nigeria than we lost but of course the bakassi issue tends to obscure all that
5230471 the former president did not negotiate out of fear on the issue of bakassi it was out of responsible statesmanship having assured the whole world that our country would abide by the icj ruling i am aware france has more interest in nigeria than in cameroon and as a student of international politics i do not see them jeopardising that strategic partnership for some sentimental factor of colonial history so there was no fear of france on the matter
5230472 but because bakassi was the focal point that has quite naturally become the only issue
5230473 in the international scene the good boy attitude is never rewarded so the decision of the yaradua administration to cede and hand over bakassi to prove whatever is very annoying and so disappointing so many nigerians are saying so
5230474 lindividuazione dellarea provvisoria nella tensostruttura del teatro ciak un importante passo avanti nel percorso che dopo 15 anni libera definitivamente i cittadini di viale jenner dal rituale della preghiera islamica
5230475 chiaro che gli europei stanno lanciando una campagna negativa contro lislam e i musulmani a dispetto delle loro richieste di dialogo interconfessionale e del rispetto dellaltro
5230476 a milano ogni venerd 3mila musulmani pregano senza che nessuno abbia messo in discussione la loro fede la nostra citt non ha mai dimostrato intolleranza e mi chiedo quante altre citt in europa di dimensioni simili a milano destinino cinque luoghi alla preghiera islamica il centro islamico di viale jenner non stato affatto chiuso

5230479 in precedenza la direzione dellistituto culturale islamico a milano aveva chiesto ai paesi arabi e islamici di intervenire per fermare la politica persecutoria del ministro degli interni italiano roberto maroni dopo la sua decisione di vietare la preghiera del venerd presso la sede dellistituto culturale islamico

5230489 he has been all year its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5230490 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5230491 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was

5230520 once again out of all the competitors it has to be the solo riders that earn the greatest respect for attempting to battle through their demons as well as the tricky conditions to compete in such a stressful event add onto that some truly awful conditions and all the soloists regardless of where they finished need a huge round of applause however the biggest slap on the back has to go to matt page who despite all the odds recorded a staggering 20 laps to take the win finishing in a much stronger and better state than he did 2 years ago at the same event richard rothwell fought well with 17 laps placing him 2nd and david powell did enough with his 16 laps to take 3rd with just 4 extra laps than the incredible matt page the salsa factory racing team took the honours in the expert mens race
5230521 matt page 1st solo i dont know where i got my energy from this morning i just kept going and seemed to have endless energy i had a nightmare on the second lap i didnt have my mud tyres on and my wheels were just clogging up and i couldnt push my bike and i just thought ive another 23 hrs of this i wasnt looking forward to it after that i picked it up and started to enjoy it it rates as the worse one i have ever done as every other one ive done there has been some period of dry but here there was just mud for the full 24hrs highlight has to be the last lap being able to enjoy the course and the realisation of what ive done i was really pleased there werent any worse parts not really well maybe the first couple of laps might have been a nightmare but i ended up enjoying myself im not sure whats happening next year im aiming to go to the worlds so that will be my focus

5230537 the first sentence is revealing the issues 300 campaign was not a formal sanctioned fundraising effort being done in cooperation with the lcms foundation this foundation keeps 40 cents on the dollar the issues 300 campaign did not raise any money for the synod and it foundation therefore it was irrelevant to the decision to cancel the show for financial reasons

5230541 but in my opinion cellphones are built as a throw away product and the astronomical volumes equate to substantial energy use and disposal problems
5230542 just not a consistent standard meaning and theres a substantial push to mine that advantage
5230543 consumers who see green or enviro friendly must be alert to details
5230544 without clear standards companies are using these terms for marketing advantage its difficult to make intelligent choices
5230545 and a big part of our thrust is consumer awareness a drawerful of handsets is not the consumers top of mind issue so were looking at when and where is the best place to intervene we want the consumers attention
5230546 but there are common denominators being eco friendly is now a differentiator for certain consumer segments and carriers are asking for it
5230547 everyone wants to reduce the use of toxic materials and energy it starts in the sand
5230548 its a combination of factors you have to look at all the pieces and impact them all and you have to be a good fortune teller to predict the next problem area
5230549 our two demands are that companies should 1 clean up their products by eliminating hazardous substances and 2 take back and recycle their products responsibly once they become obsolete
5230550 the two issues are connected the use of harmful chemicals in electronic products prevents their safe recycling once the products are discarded
5230551 i think a lot of service providers are still operating on legacy systems
5230552 the ngn transformations are expected to be complete in europe at least by the end of 2010 2011 so in that interim and during that migration if there are solutions that will be able to improve the efficiency of existing solutions well see a demand for that
5230553 interestingly enough theres a split in the industry where companies will see a market advantage because theyve phased out toxic chemicals faster than their competitors then they support stronger guidelines
5230554 i think terms of what progress to expect in five years on the chemical side there will be no player in the global market with products that have pvc or brominated flame retardants mobile phone companies have some of the best corporate policies across the board on a lot of issues especially in terms of take back because they can afford to its not as expensive to recycle and its a benefit to them because they can recycle a lot of the materials in their phones
5230555 were probably looking at doing a little more marketing but just making the program available for people has been the biggest part
5230556 were just looking for ways to bring the total amount of product we can bring back in
5230557 we havent yet seen a deceleration of the amount of e waste going into those hidden flows
5230558 oftentimes theres open burning to get scrap metal its crazy because this stuff is filled with toxic chemicals
5230559 the current legislation in the united states is positive because it is raising awareness about cellphone recycling the wireless alliance hopes that the states will remain proactive in their efforts
5230560 unless companies eliminate all hazardous chemicals from their electronic products and take responsibility for the entire life cycle of their products this poisonous dumping will continue
5230561 electronics companies must not allow their products to end up poisoning the poor around the world
5230562 the information and communication technology sector has much to offer in creating a cleaner greener world but it must also apply international standards in reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions
5230563 it is crucial that the ict industry both acknowledges and seeks to reduce its role in climate change
5230564 communications technologies can play a vital role in reducing carbon emissions worldwide developing global standards for reducing the energy requirements of networks and equipment will help make ict an even more powerful tool for businesses to use in managing their greenhouse gas emissions and meeting their climate change targets
5230565 the epa is calling on americans to reuse and recycle old electronics
5230566 recycling cellphones helps the environment by saving energy and keeping useable and valuable materials out of landfills
5230567 maintaining a successful national consumer friendly wireless recycling program has been a longstanding priority for the wireless industry
5230568 any additional effort to raise public awareness and spotlight the important issue of wireless recycling is a good thing in my book we welcome the new campaign and look forward to working with the epa and partnering companies as we continue to spread the message about how easy it is to recycle cellphones

5230576 americas future conversations about politics and policy during the 2008 republican national convention
5230577 the fundraising and the acquisition of axismobile is a dramatic acceleration for synchronica and i believe that it will build value for our shareholders we aim to build a world leader in the market of consumer mobile email and synchronization solutions and this acquisition is a key milestone that will improve our competitive positioning and accelerate our commercial growth it will increase our ability to sell to customers particularly to those in emerging economies where we see the largest potential growth for mobile email and synchronization with the fundraising and the acquisition of axismobile synchronica now has sufficient mass and funding to take advantage of the outstanding opportunity to exploit the commercial potential of mass market mobile email the next few years will be an exciting time for us all here at synchronica and for our customers around the globe we look forward with increased confidence from this inflection point
5230578 this is the start of an exciting new era for axismobile and our customers there are real synergies between synchronicas products and target markets and our own so it makes great commercial sense to combine forces both companies are committed to open standards and to developing products that work on even the most basic of handsets a must given that the market for mass market mobile email is being fuelled by demand from the developing world we are confident that the combined might of our two companies will prove to be greater than the sum of its parts

5230584 specifically it is estimated that each state execution deters somewhere between 3 and 25 murders per year 14 being the average assuming that the value of human life is approximately 5 million i e the average of the range estimates provided by viscussi 1993 our estimates imply that society avoids losing approximately 70 million per year on average at the current rate of execution all else equal

5230602 youve got to bundle it in ways that are needed to meet the requirements for helping with environmental improvements and market those effectively
5230603 in recent months the discussions of the subject have increased due to fuel costs alone not to mention the cost of goods transportation and raw materials have gone up more and more emphasis is being put on discussions and due diligence on how do we reduce costs through these type of services
5230604 hasnt had customers coming to us saying i want to save so many tons of carbon dioxide but theyve all come and said i want to save money you can save money with a conscience and thats really where green comes into play
5230605 a lot of it really is driven by conservation of cash conservation of resources and in the same token if you use less its probably going to be better for the environment
5230606 vendors have been working on this for a long time
5230607 its not like they just said were going to do this to be green because its partly about business considerations its coming along quickly because its what operators want and its what vendors have been looking to do anyway
5230608 not only do i think that going green is a good idea from a social responsibility perspective in many cases there are also financial incentives to do so in that every dollar i can save on energy costs i can spend improving the customer experience in some meaningful way
5230609 what weve always seen is that it usually takes a crisis or a really strong driver to look at new ways of innovating
5230610 when you approach the market before its ready or before theres a driver you dont see a lot of demand i think the market is starting to get there i think that people are starting to get to the reality that fuel costs and electricity costs are going to go up and its going to stay that way

5230612 democracy without honest information creates the illusion of popular consent at the same time that it enhances the power of the state and the privileged interests that the state protects and nothing characterizes corporate media today more than its disdain toward the fragile nature of modern life and its indifference toward the complex social debate required of a free and self governing people

5230624 mengapa ketika seseorang sedang dalam keadaan marah ia akan berbicara dengan suara kuat atau berteriak
5230625 karena saat seperti itu ia telah kehilangan kesabaran karena itu ia lalu berteriak
5230626 lawan bicaranya justru berada di sampingnya mengapa harus berteriak apakah ia tak dapat berbicara secara halus
5230627 ketika dua orang sedang berada dalam situasi kemarahan jarak antara kedua hati mereka menjadi amat jauh walau secara fisik mereka begitu dekat karena itu untuk mencapai jarak yang demikian mereka harus berteriak namun anehnya semakin keras mereka berteriak semakin pula mereka menjadi marah dan dengan sendirinya jarak hati yang ada di antara keduanya pun menjadi lebih jauh lagi karena itu mereka terpaksa berteriak lebih keras lagi
5230628 sebaliknya apa yang terjadi ketika dua orang saling jatuh cinta mereka tak hanya tidak berteriak namun ketika mereka berbicara suara yang keluar dari mulut mereka begitu halus dan kecil sehalus apapun keduanya bisa mendengarkannya dengan begitu jelas mengapa demikian
5230629 karena hati mereka begitu dekat hati mereka tak berjarak pada akhirnya sepatah katapun tak perlu diucapkan sebuah pandangan mata saja amatlah cukup membuat mereka memahami apa yang ingin mereka sampaikan
5230630 ketika anda sedang dilanda kemarahan janganlah hatimu menciptakan jarak lebih lagi hendaknya kamu tidak mengucapkan kata yang mendatangkan jarak di antara kamu mungkin di saat seperti itu tak mengucapkan kata kata mungkin merupakan cara yang bijaksana karena waktu akan membantu anda

5230640 esurance makes insurance easy to understand and even easier to manage i can take care of my auto insurance instantly so i have time to get on with the things that are really important to me esurances 24 7 convenience is one of the reasons why i have remained a loyal customer since buying my first car
5230641 it has been really great to work directly with real customers and hear their stories about what they like about doing business with esurance kate embodies the active on the go lifestyle that so many of us try to juggle particularly the customers who choose esurance with her pep and energy kate makes a great animated character especially in her superhero disguise which you can see in one of the commercials
5230642 another reason ive remained an esurance customer for so many years is the companys commitment to supporting worthwhile causes particularly environmental ones
5230643 its more meaningful to have esurance customers tell their stories than merely state what we want people to hear i cant think of a better way to illustrate the fact that at esurance we like to shine the spotlight on the hundreds of thousands of people who have made us successful our customers

5230693 a lot of things happened in pakistan for the good under his watch and i think that is something the history books will recall after some time
5230694 he manipulated elections he hounded his opponents and he became a dictator its not much of a legacy
5230695 he never tried to create an impression in pakistan that we were fighting for our own country and our own good
5230696 and because of that the pakistan army became a client army and pakistan became a client state in the eyes of the people it was a major failing on his part
5230697 and he didnt understand that a country of 160 million people couldnt be ruled by just one man
5230698 i am not speaking for my party i am speaking for myself as an individual i do support anwar ibrahim in this by election i am not actually supporting him too much as an individual but more on the movement that he leads

5230701 we are exercising highway robbery against the yemeni government because it has abused our rights and refused to give us our salaries
5230702 we supported the government in its fight against houthis but it did not consider our demands
5230703 weve established numerous points for highway robbery in the early morning in khab and shaaf districts well continue conducting these highway thefts and looting any property belonging to the government until it grants us all of our rights as ensured by the yemeni constitution

5230725 even those widows who enjoy social insurance cant get it directly because all insurance documents must be in a mans name
5230726 a widow always is considered a burden and subjected to more criticism and interference from others
5230727 for instance a young widow may not remarry because she must preserve the dignity of her dead husbands family moreover those with children should never consider remarriage or theyll lose custody of their children
5230728 many widows have disclosed that they feel embarrassed about constantly asking their relatives for help preferring instead to make their own income
5230729 many widows dont receive their share of the inheritance because their dead husbands family controls it and refuses to reveal the will if it exists
5230730 there are three types of working widows in yemen the first of which are those who are educated and who can depend on themselves and obtain office work
5230731 the second type are independent but have no education or skills so they work as house cleaners or babysitters finally there are those with no education and no skills so they depend on others and become beggars
5230732 we conducted a study in muaeen area of sanaa governorate where we found that 90 percent of 2 000 widows in that area are illiterate additionally many women have no income generation skills majority of yemeni widows have no education and no skills so they depend on others and sometimes become beggars which makes it harder for them to make even a small income
5230733 after i finished university i started thinking about a project to help the neediest people so i took a project management training course during that time i already was working with my friend to help poor families providing them food and collecting donations through this volunteer work i discovered that widows comprise the majority of poor families so i decided to form this organization to help them
5230734 the overwhelming majority of widows are in despair we cant do anything for them unless we instill hope in their minds and make them feel their importance as effective members of society
5230735 were planning to make deals with restaurants and cosmetics stores to buy and market the widows products
5230736 acquiring skills and obtaining work even if its hard is better than asking others for money
5230737 servants of the two sanctified homes of allah mecca and medina
5230738 parliamentarians are the voice of the people and they have the responsibility to legislate laws that will help the nations development this is why its crucial for mps to understand the development situation in yemen and how its achievement of these mdgs could be accelerated
5230739 the science of child survival has reached critical mass knowledge of many evidence based and cost effective interventions to address the major killers of children
5230740 the two laws have been tentatively approved having been presented to parliament as a whole they also have been discussed in the health and jurisprudence committees both of which have agreed on the need for such legislation well be discussing them soon item by item before they are approved finally
5230741 everyone wants it it was just a matter of conveying the right message and learning how to promote and advocate new ideas in the right way
5230742 it is worth mentioning what people do to drive away their misfortunes to avoid misfortunes and troubles people would put the head of a goat on the corner of a street to cure an illness and other needs people feed pieces of meat to kites and crows to fulfill hopes and good wishes a lemon punctured with a clove inside is thrown on the street to protect a baby from evil eye an egg is waved around the head and thrown outside ulama al su to satisfy their selfish desires ask for different costly items such as gold silver musk aud aloes wood saffron and other valuables other then money according to the status of the needy person in the name of sadaqah amp khairaat
5230743 the meaning of the word sadaqah in the language of shariah is to grant or donate with free will to others
5230744 sadaqah is that which is donated to others only to please allah and to get his nearness
5230745 enjoining what is right amp forbidding what is wrong is sadaqah
5230746 the reward for giving sadaqah in secret is seventy times superior to that of giving it publicly
5230747 and in their wealth there was the right of the

5230752 it will be the first time in yemen that a program will be broadcast without tape only via computer of course it will have a different style oriented to the needs of the audience with practical information and hints on improving personal health
5230753 during the past two years weve focused on technicians and sound engineer whereas this course was dedicated more to journalism aspects content and presentation of radio programs
5230754 it would be desirable that those who participate in training programs e g english language courses or specific training on investigative journalism would receive some benefit or gratification for their efforts
5230755 unfortunately too many people in particular too many superiors still think vocational training is a waste of time however its necessary in order to offer yemenis the chance to improve and take part in global development particularly in the field of media because yemen is not isolated
5230756 to create a framework for this cooperation well sign a memorandum of understanding with yemens general corporation for radio and television
5230757 our goal is to enable more yemenis to become trainers and to hold workshops on journalism and technical issues we desire to support radio and television in yemen to become a modern broadcasting institution that is able to be a critical observer and mediator of political and societal developments
5230758 regarding the cultural dialogues religious scholars such as sheikh abdulmajid al zindani and amer khalid will be involved in order to enable the participants to conduct constructive dialogue with those scholars who have vast experience in youth issues
5230759 through such dialogue we seek to show the real image of arab youths and their outstanding characteristics such as determination generosity and magnanimity we want the whole world to know the real image of arab nations and to correct the misconceptions that westerners have about them
5230760 it was a source of both pleasure and knowledge to witness and experience yemeni civilization and history which is valuable to all arabs
5230761 a country full of beauty and historical sights as well as friendly people when i go back home ill recount my visit to yemen to my friends
5230762 the spread of the disease depends on the farmers themselves it is caused by selecting unclean spikes
5230763 there are improved seeds that are treated in a way that can fight the fungus
5230764 losses differ from one farmer to another the lazy farmer would lose the most on some farms losses could run to 60 percent if the fungus is left untreated then it causes higher losses
5230765 maize production has begun to increase it is cultivated on 600 000 hectares and this year the area of cultivation has increased
5230766 any part of the plant above the ground can be invaded although it is more common on the ears the tassels and the nodes than it is on the leaves the internodes and aerial roots after the spores mature the covering becomes dry and brittle breaks open and permits the black powdery contents to fall out

5230768 weve gone from 50 rooms to 504 rooms quite a jump in our community profile
5230769 i also think our new hospital is driving part of it and weve got some companies here with international connections so were having more people from outside the u s who want to stay near our industrial companies
5230770 were also having more recreational traffic related to outings at joe pool lake and to the citys new baseball complex big league dreams
5230771 the stadium will be hosting so many events other than cowboys games that i believe were having a spillover effect in terms of hotel construction
5230772 weve been focusing on acquisition of a full service hotel with restaurants meeting and conference rooms
5230773 other than a few small spaces in local restaurants mansfield has a dearth of spaces big enough to host larger meetings
5230774 big hotels like it when their patrons can walk outside to shop go to movies or other restaurants

5230779 and because of that the pakistan army became a client army and pakistan became a client state in the eyes of the people it was a major failing on his part

5230781 we are going to dig out a triangle area at the bottom of the slipway to give us better access to some of the deepest water in the marina
5230782 we will be able to better cater for the size and numbers of boats that we need for the future
5230783 they are correct because we say so and everyone we talked to about it agrees with us
5230784 the real questions are these why are the synods overhead and development costs so high as to undermine its outreach ministries why is so much money paid out to consulting firms
5230785 in addition to the h 1b issue the process for quickly and easily converting a student visa to a permanent resident green card visa needs reform panelists said there are some efforts in congress to address some of the immigration issues for technical workers but this legislation is stalled in committees and is unlikely to be passed in an election year

5230798 this is the first time weve really had a chance to talk
5230799 and i wanted to make sure there were no hard feelings about things that were said during the campaign
5230800 i cant imagine why there might be hard feelings mr president i make it a policy to never comment publicly on politics or politicians
5230801 your secretary said it was a matter of some urgency
5230802 well as one of my law professors used to say urgency like horseshoes and handguns is a matter of interpretation
5230803 see thats what im getting out youre mad at me arent you
5230804 i was simply asking for the specific details for your assertion
5230805 now dont go talking how that was symbolic that was an accident
5230806 right and already i got every left wing outfit screaming that im not doing enough for them reminding me of promises i made promises i dont even remember making
5230807 then they put out the video on youtube and darned if im not in front of some crowd promising to do all kinds of ridiculousness
5230808 mr president am i supposed to feel sorry for you is that the purpose of this visit today
5230809 i said some nastiness about you during the campaign and just wanted to let you know i didnt really mean it
5230810 you brought me here to tell me that you lied about me to further your career
5230811 actually no mr president john adams was the first president to move into the white house
5230812 poor folks folks born without power or influence folks from broken homes and broken hearts and here we are at the top of the world
5230813 ill tell michele to retroactively push back the date of the first time she was proud of her country
5230814 my point is last year i got on tv and said i wouldnt have appointed you to the supreme court okay
5230815 i said i didnt think you were a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time
5230816 yeah but i want you to know i was just going through the motions
5230817 you got to play the d c game if you want to get ahead right
5230818 mr president i can assure you i have been called much much worse than an inadequate legal thinker
5230819 ive been called un american because i didnt wear a stupid flag pin and then when i did wear it they said i was caving in to fox news
5230820 they said i had no real accomplishments in the senate other than claiming to be on a subcommittee i didnt sit on
5230821 that barry obama he took his children to a church led by a racist demagogue for twenty years he got a sweetheart land deal from a political fixer who wasnt even a felon at the time
5230822 they said i was a media construct as desperately in need of a teleprompter as any anchorman that barry obama hes untested hes a lightweight hes totally unprepared to deal with the geopolitical threats to the nation me
5230823 they said that about me did they ever say any of those things about you
5230824 so maybe im the one owed an apology you ever think about that
5230825 we were forced to withdraw from parliament since several points of the draft were not agreed on by both political sides

5230869 roadside trees in sanaa are exposed to exhaust pollution as a result of the increasing number of vehicles some trees die while others are exposed to disease trees can only tolerate such contaminants to a certain degree and then they die
5230870 a layer of such contaminants is visible on the tree leaves particularly on high traffic roads like siteen yasser arafat khawlan berlin hadda and jumhury streets
5230871 trees absorb approximately three kilograms of toxic gases from vehicle exhausts every day
5230872 you can see that flowers also are flecked and their growth also is very slow
5230873 for instance trees have been found to have 5 percent of this pollution whereas flowers have from 10 percent to 15 percent fortunately most plants even those sensitive to damage are believed to tolerate air pollution damage during their dormancy
5230874 we noticed this when we began planting this type of tree on taiz street
5230875 on the other hand ficus trees are very tolerant and resistant to this type of pollution so were now planting ficus trees on all streets
5230876 exhaust pollution and its physical and mental effects upon humans
5230877 trees of the same species growing in identical locations may vary in their susceptibility to damage for example one tree may show no sign of the problem while the tree next to it will drop brown leaves and die older leaves are most likely to show symptoms because theyve been exposed to exhaust pollution for longer periods
5230878 we sometimes see trees decline and become pale but we dont know the reasons i see engineers put chemical fertilizer on them
5230879 we must prevent the importation of diesel engines as well as find some type of device that can be placed on vehicle exhausts to reduce this type of pollution
5230880 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5230881 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them

5230885 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax

5230887 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5230888 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed

5230895 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5230896 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5230897 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5230898 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5230899 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5230900 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5230901 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5230902 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5230903 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was

5230923 the afghans did not go to canada to kill the canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghan
5230924 therefore you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5230925 but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children events such as logar will happen again

5230948 this land was in bad condition it was barren and full of stones first i made drains and removed the stones making it better i filled the drains i planted trees with the main objective that i could use them to earn my living but the government banned cutting of trees the trees keeps multiplying
5230949 when i planted trees people called me a mad person i cannot keep the count of saplings i have planted here but i can say there are over three lakhs trees here this year alone ive already planted 300 saplings
5230950 snoring can ruin lives for some the hairdryer treatment of a boot camp is the only option
5230951 as part of any agreement to take part in the camp our sergeant major will inspect each guests bags for contraband items such as alcohol or cigarettes both of which can make snoring worse
5230952 the aim is to provide as much advice and information as possible to the selected snorers and their families helping them to reduce or stop the problem altogether its going to be tough but the results will be worth it
5230953 there is no one reason in particular why people snore we will look at each case individually this is not a trivial problem the spouses of some snorers are at their wits end

5230966 neither the bulldogs nor sonny bill have anything further to gain by drawing this situation out any further
5230967 they have done a traverse of g1 full and then went down to bc for rest and refueling
5230968 so it wasnt a traverse itself rather a double header
5230969 to me the high point of the climb was the traverse of g1 in pure alpine style alone on the route so hats off for this achievement
5230970 they are great and honest climbers and i am sure that they want us to admire their real achievements not ones they didnt do i am waiting anxiously for their original report

5230986 it seems that labours unpopular plans for a national road pricing scheme are alive and well

5230999 the main difference between the two parties is that the italians started on g2 and it took them 4 days from g2 top to the summit of g1 and 7 days of total climbing the poles started on g1 and it took them 11 days from g1 top to the summit of g2 and 20 days climbing
5231000 it is an incredible achievement for poland to revisit a very difficult conquest that remained unrepeated for 24 years
5231001 didnt jean christophe lafaille do a traverse on gi gii in 1996
5231002 jean christophe lafaille did a double header and a good one solo just 4 days between the two summits and opening a partially new route on gi there are 35 cases of climbers who did the same double headers on gi and gii are pretty common especially nowadays
5231003 but to do a traverse the climber must face the entire ridge between the two peaks traversed j c summited gi then came back to the bc of gi and then used another route to summit gii
5231004 he did not traverse the ridge between gi and gii the only two parties that did this traverse are kammerlander messner and now hamor morawski i advise that even hamor morawski will be investigated when the expedition is over to see if they really did a traverse or a double header until now everything conspires favorable to a traverse

5231011 we have had all our crews out since virtually two oclock yesterday afternoon and all through the night dealing with incidents relating to flood water
5231012 i dont think weve either seen a time when the flooding has been as devastating as this or has affected the road transport as badly
5231013 at about two oclock this morning the river at the back of the caravan parks in newcastle burst its banks and flooded a large number of caravans
5231014 the police and the coastguard evacuated people to the newcastle centre and the coastguard organised sleeping bags and we laid out our karate and gym mats for people to sleep on
5231015 it happened so fast that they had no chance to do any sandbagging or anything so they just had to come out of their houses
5231016 there were a lot of people who were fairly distressed about having to leave their property with their belongings floating around
5231017 the water was as high as the pumping station outside
5231018 it came right into our home and came halfway up the stairs our fridge freezer was floating in the water

5231023 my wife is a wreck she has gone down to seven stone and his sister is devastated
5231024 she used to be a happy go lucky person but shes not anymore

5231128 its not a role that i carry home with happiness in deepti navals film do paise ki dhoop chaar aane ki baarish im cast as a girl who not only has to look plain she has to look ugly sometimes plainly repulsive its not easy playing someone like that it affects me badly so this was a sober birthday for me
5231129 my look and the wretchedness of my character will remind people of charlize theron in monster i think she won an oscar for that
5231130 normally ive a big party every year where i invite all my friends or i go off to one my favourite countries spain or france this year i was in no mood to travel or celebrate
5231131 my father who was seriously ill is recuperating at home and though hes well on the way to recovery i didnt feel like a noisy party this time i think im over all those party times
5231132 with just me my brother siddharth my bhabhi and my parents and a few very close friends including deepti of course i cant ask for anything more actually i can
5231133 my boyfriend chris could be with me but hes in the us working and unable to join me for my birthday never mind
5231134 ive everything i can possibly want but yes at the end of this year im getting myself a house in paris im just waiting for real estate prices to fall more its been rapidly falling all over the world and that includes france but surprisingly real estate prices are still high in paris itself i think ill wait six more months
5231135 so it was a double celebration in my house its very rare that both these occasions come together its even rarer that all of us in the family are together for a double celebration i guess i am one lucky girl

5231177 it took me a lap to kind of recover and during the fourth lap i started feeling better
5231178 overall im very happy just being in the right position it was where i wanted to be coming off the bike it was the same thing i knew it was coming down to the run and i knew id do the best i could
5231179 hes happy to be part of my games and my experience
5231180 i definitely want to be on top of the podium
5231181 we are very sure it does not apply on maori reservation its not for councils to say whether or not you can construct a wharenui and its not for them to lay down their kawa the hapu were building wharenui in 1839 they were building them in 1841 we dont see whats changed
5231182 well its been two years in design so far and it will be another two years in the consenting process we will expect to see in the life of this project ups and downs in the housing market were a long term player and 2500 houses are going to take a long time to work its way through and were prepared for the long haul
5231183 the value systems that maori had prior to the european how they actually related to al the elements in nature as being living beings like pukunui talks to the sun and to the stars and he talks to the wood in the trees as though they were human beings because i believe at that particular time maori were closer than they are today
5231184 pauls been around apart form that fact that in our day he was an exceptional footballer a gritty determined one too and that often tells you the type of character a blokes got when youve seen him on the footy field stepping up hes there hekia parata we all know is a very capable person georgina te heuheu without her there wouldnt be maori in the national party
5231185 my perceptions of the stereotype in the newspaper and the media and from my readings was that the majority were young were maori theres other kinds of stuff that goes with it that they were promiscuous that they ere substance abusers theres all kinds of stuff that gets perpetuated in the media and from my reading and my research i knew that just wasnt the case
5231186 for far too long now weve gone ahead and done things and weve done them because of this aroha we have for our whenua our kaumatua and our kuia and theyre now saying aroha is not going to feed our moko and although we still have that aroha its time that our time our experience our expertise was valued
5231187 can he get the title for liverpool as ronaldo did last season why not
5231188 of course they are different players ronaldo comes in from the side but fernando is a real striker he has everything to be the best player this season
5231189 there was nothing on when he got the ball but he scores a few goals like that he is always looking for the target and as soon as he gets space to shoot he shoots and often scores
5231190 fernando played wonderfully at the euros and always when you need him he scores very important goals
5231191 he is a top quality player and for me he is the best striker in the world if you are speaking about a real striker he is the pinnacle he is everything not only in normal games but more often than not in special games

5231197 ireland is a place that i would not have a problem living in for the couple of months that it took me to make the film its a delightful place
5231198 ive been there on several occasions and the light in ireland is so beautiful that you know right away youre going to get a beautiful film
5231199 those grey skies and the terrain ireland is one of the few places that lives up to the hype it is as beautiful as everybody tells you it is so it is a very good place to make a film
5231200 there is a huge amount of irish directors from john carney to kirsten sheridan who would have been inspired by his work
5231201 it was very surprising that these subjects would still have cells floating in their blood so long afterward
5231202 most people have a notion that elderly people have very weak immunity or they have lost immunity this study shows that extremely elderly people have retained memory of being infected with the 1918 flu even 90 years later
5231203 this study shows that humans can develop very potent immune responses against dangerous influenza that cause pandemics
5231204 it gives us hope that we can develop vaccines and antibody treatments for any other pandemic viruses that come along

5231209 the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of god
5231210 if god were not angry at injustice and deception and did not make a final end to violence that god would not be worthy of worship the only means of prohibiting all recourse to violence by ourselves is to insist that violence is legitimate only when it comes from god my thesis that the practice of non violence requires a belief in divine vengeance will be unpopular with many in the west but it takes the quiet of a suburban home for the birth of the thesis that human non violence results from the belief in gods refusal to judge

5231216 the fact is mega church ministry people are dont like the shack because it is a threat to their superiority and control of peoples beliefs if you lose that then you lose power and we cant have that now can we its ironic that from the very church that unknowingly followed a closet homosexual egomaniac ceo pastor this viewpoint would be put out with pride and superiority
5231217 figurative mode of representation conveying a meaning other than the literal

5231219 woe to you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you are like
5231220 command certain men not to teach false doctrines any longer
5231221 most people who rave about this havent read a book for years
5231222 people who believe this just do it to feel good
5231223 the author went through a really hard time and tried to explain it away so what if he missed a few theological points in the process
5231224 even if i caused you sorrow by my letter i do not regret it though i did regret it i see that my letter hurt you but only for a little while yet now i am happy not because you were made sorry but because your sorrow led you to repentance for you became sorrowful as god intended and so were not harmed in any way by us godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret but worldly sorrow brings death see what this godly sorrow has produced in you what earnestness what eagerness to clear yourselves what indignation what alarm what longing what concern what readiness to see justice done
5231225 i mean i wouldnt have been there in the state that i was in but i wasnt really thinking there would be someone driving by with a video camera on the roof filming me either
5231226 hes probably one of my favorite tennis players to watch on tv
5231227 i dont want this sport to be an every four years sport
5231228 in between the four years theres really not as much exposure as id like
5231229 my whole goal is to change the sport of swimming in a positive way
5231230 i think it can go even farther thats where i hope to take it
5231231 michael is the biggest thing that sport has ever seen
5231232 not swimming but sport in general he just made the pressure putt to win the u s open he just won the tour of france he just knocked out muhammad ali and he did it in one week
5231233 but were fighting against basketball and baseball and football and hockey
5231234 this sport has changed my life and allowed me to do so many things
5231235 momentum is certainly picking up on the sell side the main worry for me in this market is liquidity which is particularly weak
5231236 most investors on the long side are patiently waiting still for the market to become cheaper
5231237 investors celebrated the news expecting that political uncertainty and confrontation will now end
5231238 it just shows that we in pakistan rejoice both the arrival and the departure of a person
5231239 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday
5231240 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5231241 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5231242 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5231243 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5231244 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5231245 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else
5231246 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5231247 everyone expected liu to do well as well as he did four years ago
5231248 we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5231249 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5231250 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the birds nest for more
5231251 and will encourage him to come back to the track
5231252 i think they will be disappointed but they will understand
5231253 i just came here to compete and take the gold i dont care whos on the track

5231302 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5231303 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe

5231309 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5231310 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5231311 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5231312 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up

5231319 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5231320 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5231321 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars

5231426 i think its probably one of the greatest things sport in general has ever seen

5231445 when the first boat went through the line and the gun went off we just looked at each other and thought weve just got to get through that line

5231470 in the promotional products industry we have a common saying that every promotional pen has an average of six users in its lifetime we had the idea to demonstrate the progression of passing a pen along from one person to the next much like the pop culture game six degrees of kevin bacon this is a highly effective way to show just how many impressions one promotional pen will have
5231471 if a client has 5 000 to spend on advertising they can either buy one page advertisement in the local paper or they can buy 5 000 writing instruments unlike the newspaper ad which will only appear in one edition the pens will be passed from user to user allowing the decorated message to live on for years to come to think of the number of people who see or use just one of those pens is staggering if as consumers we look in our desks in our purses or next to our home telephones well find a pen with someone elses name on it theres no reason it cant be your name on that pen

5231504 the amarnath issue is not going to settle down it is a fight between the nationalists and the separatists what is the harm if the party takes up a campaign to mobilise public opinion in favour of the nationalist forces
5231505 im very happy to be number one but the feeling doesnt change too much because the last years i did very well too

5231509 winning that one was something of a relief now i can concentrate on more

5231527 in the minds of many americans of influence and position at the time the post 1890 immigrants jews italians slavs greeks were probably as foreign as hispanics are today and considered as hispanics are today as in some degree nonwhite
5231528 i wonder whether in the course of the fierce debates on immigration in the first quarter of the 20th century anyone ever tried to calculate when new immigrants and their children would be a majority of the u s i am sure someone among the immigration restrictionists must have raised that alarm
5231529 the process of assimilation is such that our views of the degree of difference of newer nonwhite groups changes rapidly
5231530 so the jews and italians considered very foreign at the time of immigration by henry adams and others were much less foreign by the 30s hardly foreign at all by the 60s they were then as white as other whites for a time called white ethnics
5231531 even the notion of hispanics ranges in people of european origin in chile to those of native america origin in the lowlands of mexico
5231532 there are a lot of nasty rumors and smears about him going around
5231533 there are going to be many districts where the obama campaign helps our candidates but our candidates are going to bring out people and we want to be sure they vote for obama as well

5231551 the number of new listings measured this month stands at 106 000 which is almost 25 down on what we would expect to see at this time of year
5231552 this indicates that the number of transactions that the land registry will eventually report for the rest of 2008 will continue to be at historical lows
5231553 sen obama has blazed a new path and we are all working to emulate that as much as possible
5231554 as younger hoosiers are getting interested in presidential politics we want them to check out the governors race too

5231564 what i love but it was really great to get that perspective from another genre and kind of bring it to life in this
5231565 a lot of the kind of influences for this record werent necessarily hip hop influences
5231566 despite the fact that its very much a hip hop record like id be giving dan folk tracks to listen to just for the writing and vice versa
5231567 everyone in my class was listening to nirvana and i felt like i was kind of separating myself from all of that with music because i pretty much always felt a bit like that it was that kind of outcast thing you know
5231568 he basically had a home studio and he had an eight track reel to reel and drum machines and all this kind of stuff
5231569 sometimes id just wag school and go to his house to use the studio and stuff
5231570 i was learning how to produce right then and there
5231571 i just loved all these machines you know you could make a whole piece of music without needing anyone to help you
5231572 it used to be an adrenaline rush but now its really a release
5231573 im no psychologist but hopefully i can do something for someone

5231590 el objetivo es mejorar mi marca que es de 3 42 en los mil metros y espero estar en la final
5231591 unfortunately we see no signs that the russians are starting to pull out or even preparing to withdraw from georgia
5231592 there is no real sign of a withdrawal so it is difficult to understand what is going on with the russians
5231593 i hope he intends to honour the pledge this time
5231594 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5231595 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5231596 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way

5231603 dan kamu sekali kali tiadak dapat berlaku adil di antara isteri isteri mu walaupun kamu sangat ingin demikian

5231663 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5231664 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5231665 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5231666 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5231667 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy

5232045 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5232046 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5232047 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5232048 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5232049 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5232050 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5232051 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5232052 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5232053 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5232054 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5232055 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5232056 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5232057 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5232058 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5232059 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5232060 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5232061 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5232062 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5232063 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5232211 the internet provides tremendous educational opportunities for children yet there are also many potential dangers that our kids face online
5232212 parents need to know how to keep their kids safe online and we hope they will use all the resources available to help protect their families

5232214 today the internet has radically changed the dynamics of bullying cyber bullying is a growing problem nearly one in six u s children grades 6 to 10 is a victim each year

5232217 if parents are aware of the signs that their child is involved in cyber bullying they will be able to make better choices and help protect their child
5232218 as kids go back to school we hope parents will equip them with the latest knowledge in how to protect their privacy online how to avoid cyber bullies and not to be a victim of cyber criminals

5232293 i had shells pinecones bones and fossils whatever i could find
5232294 i would display in there and the whole room was filled up with that stuff to the brink
5232295 that means that you dont outlaw chemicals but you want to diminish them as much as you can and use cultural methods hygienic methods and biological methods
5232296 i had that gardening background and i had agricultural knowledge my specialty was soil science when i studied
5232297 i always painted my whole life and that all combined really well with the landscaping
5232298 even landscapers come to have their designs drawn by me
5232299 you dont have to redo anything you dont have to buy anything
5232300 its under the aspect of doing it yourself in an economical way
5232301 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5232302 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5232303 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5232304 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5232305 michael will be out for two to three weeks the ankle swelled up right away and we couldnt give him any time to recover
5232306 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5232307 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5232308 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5232309 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5232310 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5232311 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5232312 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5232313 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5232314 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5232315 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5232316 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5232317 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5232318 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5232319 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5232320 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5232321 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

5232340 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5232341 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5232342 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5232343 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5232344 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5232345 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5232346 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5232347 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5232348 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5232349 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5232350 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5232351 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5232352 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5232353 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5232354 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5232355 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5232356 i want to thank you all for writing me and being supportive of things that are going on in my life

5232362 i dont care about these rumours dhoni is a good friend of mine and its ridiculous to jump to assumptions because are spotted together at many places i can go out for dinner with him and its not such a big deal
5232363 i didnt give him anything john gave him the helmet my gift to dhoni is still pending
5232364 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5232365 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5232366 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5232367 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5232368 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5232369 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5232370 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

5232372 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5232373 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

5232398 i feel old saying that but weve got some fantastic players its just one game but were heading in the right direction
5232399 weve got to work on the negatives and the positives will come if we keep doing what were doing

5232411 the whistles and drums are an effective means of communication that will alert both police patrols and the public to respond in case of an incident on these acts of theft and armed thuggery
5232412 the police have netted about 30 people some of whom have already appeared in court while others are to be handed to higher security organizations to help get more information about the armed robbery
5232413 at a point he stopped after two hours of praying and said my daughter was possessed he asked if covenant had eaten and i answered in the negative
5232414 since the pastor insisted that the prayer and fasting period would be done in the church i decided to rush home to pack some of my clothes and other perishable things i left outside but when i got home it was too late for me to go back therefore i called essi the lady that introduced me to the pastor to give my daughter wrapper with which to cover herself with a promise to check on her the next day
5232415 at that point i became curious and went to essis house to enquire about the pastor she tried him on his phone but there was no response all we heard was that the phone was switched off
5232416 some cultists were hired to execute the plan but the intention was to rattle the ssg and tell him that he is not in charge of ika politics as he wants to show however they kidnapped his father quite alright but the whole thing did not go down the way they planned it
5232417 first i want to make it clear that chief okowa is not the target of the kidnap even though he was the one abducted the actual target is his son dr okowa
5232418 it is a complete farce everybody knows that chief iwerebor is the political leader in agbor and there was no time oga referring to okowa wanted to push him aside as leader he gives him his due respect as the political leader of the area
5232419 they reportedly hired some cultists to kidnap his father and the job was very easy for them because there was no security in the house and the people are not used to abduction in that part of the state
5232420 the boys were very tidy the way they used their gsm handsets to call the ssg we tried to locate them by going to the mtn office in lagos but at times it will indicate that they were in benin city and also showing somewhere in delta state we could not really pin them down to a particular place
5232421 as the father of the ssg said after his six day ordeal in the hands of his kidnappers it appears as if the abductors were brainwashed by their sponsors to believe after dealing with okowa they would make money by kidnapping commissioners in the state
5232422 because of the lack of aggravating factors your guilty plea and previous good character today we are going to deal with this matter by way of a fine
5232423 sir i dont think we know each other and i have no idea what youre talking about and since we dont know each other i cant see what problem wed have but im wondering why youre staring at me
5232424 when you lead that sort of life you have to understand that when your level drops then the knives will be out he is like that he likes going out and enjoying life
5232425 he was full of life ever since he arrived and thats how he won two leagues and a champions league
5232426 he has his own private life that should not be interfered with but it is true that that private life also affects his sporting performances
5232427 ronie went from being an idol for all barcelona fans to being jeered and criticised and that hurts anyone
5232428 people think that he is unprofessional and a bad team mate as if he were some sort of time bomb waiting to explode in the dressing room but he is nothing of the sort he is an example of professionalism
5232429 he knows he has made a lot of mistakes but he surprises me with the enthusiasm and sacrifice he makes in every game he wants to be the best and he is
5232430 rijkaard believes in self regulation but that is almost impossible in a team like barcelona where the players earn a lot of money and win a lot of trophies
5232431 in all collective activities there has to be order and discipline and that is what guardiola has imposed as a coach he knows what he wants and he has got some very clear ideas
5232432 i didnt really want to send a message its more like i wanted to remind myself why i came here i wanted to reassure myself by winning the heat

5232435 i tried to rehearse the strategy i want to use in the final i just wanted to sit on the field until the halfway mark then take off with two or three spurts
5232436 i think there are three people to watch for in the final andreas dittmer who won several olympics and wants to finish his last one with a nice win and theres a young canadian thomas hall who i think is worth watching

5232478 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5232479 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5232480 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5232481 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5232482 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5232483 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5232484 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5232485 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5232486 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5232487 i feel that her hands call me again and again

5232570 we take great pride in having carefully updated the look and feel of the original show for todays kids while retaining all of the elements that made the original banana splits such a hit

5232572 the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe
5232573 dr thaksin shinawatra to help communicate his vision and aspirations for the club
5232574 my experience is exactly the opposite and id rather make a judgment based on my experience than some theoretical hypothesis my job is that i run a commercial organisation so i dont deliberately do things that are bad for it commercially i might make a judgment error but so far we are the number one in the uk so we must be doing something right
5232575 listen im an agent not a principal if people think someone is a dictator then thats his problem and not mine i believe that everybody is entitled to their advocate i would never ask anybody here to do something which they were morally or ethically opposed to when we did a job for the norwegian government on whaling a number of people didnt want to work on it and i said they didnt have to
5232576 or try not to would probably be a more honest way of putting it
5232577 because im clearly a conservative and take the conservative whip in the house of lords everybody assumes that i run my business on the basis of being a conservative which is absolute rubbish

5232583 no because im older but i love my job and it has got better not worse i think ive got better at it because ive got more experience and because its more interesting now dealing with the mobile phone and the internet is a really interesting challenge and has had a real structural effect on our industry
5232584 i have to embrace digital technology because it would be stupid for me not to its not easy because im old and all the faces in the digital world are young but theres an inbuilt assumption that people who are young use the internet and people that are old dont its not true
5232585 our experience is that whatever the turbulence in the stock market whatever is being said about gloom and doom in the economy its not showing up in our figures
5232586 although people are having difficulties over credit and so on they are still using communications to talk to people about it whereas in the last downturn they said its a nightmare im not going to say a thing until its over
5232587 unfortunately a large number of people in our industry are not in it because they want a career and they want to understand how it works they just want a job they want to work for the least number of hours for the most amount of money our industry is populated by a lot of people who really arent very interested in what they do
5232588 on the other hand our role has become more important and people at the top of the business are contributing a hell of a lot more than they used to theyre invited to the top table because the discussion about how you are going to communicate something is almost as important as what youre going to communicate

5232656 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5232657 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5232658 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5232659 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

5232695 my resignation will go to the speaker of the national assembly today i leave my future in the hands of people
5232696 not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me
5232697 no charge can be proved against me because i never did anything for myself it was all for pakistan unfortunately some elements acting for vested interests levelled false allegations against me and deceived people
5232698 people have said my policies that during the last nine years our economic problems and electricity shortages were due to our policies it is absolutely wrong and deception for the country over the past nine years have been wrong they were wrong
5232699 on the map of the world pakistan is now an important country by the grace of allah
5232700 this is an issue that is not on the table
5232701 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
5232702 many problems have not been solved not even by the united nations and some want them to be solved during the olympic games putting pressure on the international olympic committee and the beijing olympic committee

5232719 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5232720 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5232721 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5232722 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5232723 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5232724 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5232725 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5232726 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5232727 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5232728 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5232729 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5232730 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5232731 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5232732 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5232733 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5232734 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5232735 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5232736 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5232737 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5232738 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5232739 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5232740 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5232741 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5232742 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5232743 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5232744 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5232745 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5232746 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5232747 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5232748 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5232749 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5232750 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5232751 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5232752 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5232753 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5232754 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5232755 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5232756 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5232757 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5232758 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5232759 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5232760 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5232761 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5232762 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5232763 they have taken over the business centre the rural banks pawnshops
5232764 our leadership has not sanctioned these attacks this has to stop if we can confirm the involvement of our forces
5232765 as your commander in chief i have ordered the armed forces of the philippines and the philippine national police to defend every inch of philippine territory against milf forces and immediately restore peace in the affected areas in lanao del norte
5232766 we will not tolerate and will crush any attempt to disturb peace and development in mindanao

5232812 we talked about your tits about how nice and firm and round they are
5232813 about how much we wanted to lick and suck them
5232814 then we talked about that nice round ass and how nice it would be to do you doggy style
5232815 then we talked about how nice and puffy your pussy gets when youre excited
5232816 i was thinking that what would happen if jay found you nude like that but i wasnt home yet to meet him
5232817 i thought you were going to comment on our lovemaking
5232818 thats great to know ellen but sometimes i do wish that i was a fly on the wall
5232819 just to watch as it unfolds without anyone knowing im actually there it would be such a turn on for me seeing someone else all alone with that delicious body of yours even for a few minutes
5232820 dan youre asking for trouble we dont know what some stranger may do
5232821 youre right but what if it werent a total stranger suppose jay showed up alone yesterday hes always had the hots for you but hes a friend its not like hed lose control and jump on you

5232824 i dont know dan jay knows us well see him again it could be awkward
5232825 he doesnt live here anymore so itd be pretty harmless look hes already seen you once whats a little exhibitionism between friends he told me hes staying at a friends place they have an in ground heated pool and he asked me to come over
5232826 its a plant outside the argyle house that is happily climbing up the telegraph pole if thats what you call the pole obviously plants dont read its having a fine time parked there and looking pretty too

5232848 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
5232849 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
5232850 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
5232851 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
5232852 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
5232853 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
5232854 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
5232855 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
5232856 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
5232857 a guide pin follows the contour of the original while a carbide bit does the cutting
5232858 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5232859 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5232860 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5232861 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5232862 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5232863 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5232864 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5232865 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5232866 who are open to doing something on the production side
5232867 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5232868 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5232869 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5232870 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5232871 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5232872 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5232873 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5232874 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5232875 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5232876 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5232877 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5232878 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5232879 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5232880 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5232881 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5232882 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5232883 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5232884 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5232885 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5232886 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5232887 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

5232895 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5232896 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5232897 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

5232900 they are the most astounding images of any planetary surface that our cameras have so far taken
5232901 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday
5232902 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5232903 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5232904 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5232905 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5232906 ive never ordered tomato juice in a pub before in my life

5232908 i think it is the right thing for him to have done

5232913 as i understand it yes there are rights of appeal zentais son ernie steiner said outside the court today
5232914 last time we went through the issue of the constitution but this is an entirely different argument now mr steiner said
5232915 and so there are similar rights available to my father
5232916 your honours task is not to delve into foreign law mr donaldson told the court
5232917 on the material before you there is no relevant extradition offence
5232918 not at the level expected from a silicon valley startup
5232919 only very large enterprises could afford it and it was hard to justify paying those prices for a product that simply automated what developers could already do for themselves with free tools
5232920 when i go into sites i would love to turn them on to the benefits of the testng test framework
5232921 but most organisations do so little unit testing if any that i stick with the simple well known xunit tools so as not to create confusion most organisations are just not ready to learn anything more than basic unit testing if that
5232922 the problem with unit testing is that it increases the cost of development before you know whether what you developed is what you needed afterwards when you have a working solution theres little interest in writing unit tests as what you have works and your management wants you to move on
5232923 many developers and managers mistakenly think that by cutting testing they well get feature x out faster what they dont realise is that you are robbing peter to pay paul

5232926 it was a total stitch up i was cheated as soon as i walked in simon recognised me and i just knew it was downhill from there
5232927 it was such a cold atmosphere i could tell he and louis didnt want to give me a chance because id been on a reality show before
5232928 and because cheryl knew me they wanted to wind her up for the cameras to make good telly
5232929 simon knew me but it never came across ive been to his house twice and had dinner there
5232930 they didnt mention the two and a half years i spent in phixx our top ten single or the number one album in south africa they just tried to take the mickey out of me by showing me in a half empty working mens club
5232931 they wanted it to look like my life was in the pits i was just a pawn in their game it was humiliating
5232932 i have got a lot of interest from people in the business and im confident there will be some movement
5232933 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5232934 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5232935 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5232936 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5232951 risks to medium term price stability in the euro area have in conjuction with continued strong external price pressures increased further
5232952 nevertheless during the first half of 2008 fresh burdens have added to lingering uncertainty and persisting global challenges such that the accumulated risk mix is now no longer free of tangible effects for the domestic economy and points to a slower pace for the remainder of the year

5232956 shortly after 20 more orphaned youth were trained and the business was born
5232957 our profits are continually reinvested into company operations as well as the lives of our staff our hope is to grow to provide steady employment to 300 orphaned young people in rwanda and to provide a model for sustainable job creation in africa
5232958 building the economy of rwanda requires solutions that empower the aspiring yet disadvantaged group of young men and women
5232959 we believe sustainable business is a key ingredient to lifting rwanda out of poverty
5232960 we make high quality products made in one of the poorest countries available to the international market at competitive prices in return we offer well paid employment to those who need it the most coupled with valuable life skills
5232961 you fucked up and im the shit now begone wench
5232962 if cameras are about safety good if they are about raising money not good
5232963 the government says keep them all it is fantastic i disagree
5232964 those ones that are about safety those ones that are about making sure drivers slow down on dangerous stretches of road there is a purpose for those
5232965 i can name you some speed cameras where you know it is perfectly clear it is just about trying to get the money off the motorist and is not really improving safety
5232966 get a conservative government and we will order a review of speed cameras the ones that are about safety stay the ones that are about raising money go
5232967 of course a green tax that genuinely is about trying to make people make a different decision and that money being used to cut taxes for families that we would be in favour of
5232968 right now british motorists need a bit of a break
5232969 that sounds like brilliant news it is something that would be most welcome
5232970 at the moment the answer to every accident is a speed camera we have got to get away from that
5232971 we know that crashes and collisions have reduced at speed camera sites they are making people slow down
5232972 if people are doing the speed limit they wont get caught
5232973 any money that we do make goes back to the government and we get a grant which we plough back into education and publicity
5232974 the jury is still out on the benefit of cameras there are many other more effective schemes recent trials on new road markings and lining on fast roads have proved very effective these schemes give the impression that the road in narrowing and therefore the driver reduces their speed accordingly this has the required effect and is cheaper than the camera option this is what we want in fylde a safer more effective option
5232975 speed cameras are there for a reason if you are not committing any offence and you are not speeding then there is no problem
5232976 the overwhelming worldwide popularity of a guitar oriented video game is just amazing guitar hero has opened the doors to the electric guitar for a legion of kids these days it just seemed incredibly cool to be able to make my own brand of face plates available to the market

5233081 maar doordat accell dreigde met een rechtszaak vanwege patentbreuk zijn ze afgehaakt
5233082 bovendien zijn chinese producenten heel angstig voor inbreuk op patenten zodra iemand hier met een papiertje komt zwaaien stoppen ze de productie door de intimidatie is ook dit jaar voor de derde keer ons seizoen naar de knoppen we blijven nu met 15 000 fietsen zitten
5233083 bij het ontwerpen van de fiets zijn we erg consci ntieus geweest om niet de sparta ion na te maken
5233084 maar we willen ook compensatie van accell en de toezegging dat ze mijn klanten niet meer intimideren
5233085 in het sparta patent gaat het bijvoorbeeld over de planetaire werking van de fiets hoe dat werkt wordt niet uiteengezet daarnaast wordt omschreven dat de hulpmotor op de as van het wiel hub motor in vaktermen red allang bestaat dat klopt die is in 1902 uitgevonden vervolgens claimen zij die motor onder hun patent
5233086 en als iemand het er niet mee eens is dan zijn daar offici le wegen voor een partij kan oppositie instellen en dan kunnen wij ons verdedigen vervolgens beslist de octrooiraad of het patent deugt maar we hebben het nagezocht en prime tech heeft geen offici le klacht ingediend
5233087 de commerci le waarde van een patent valt niet te onderschatten en er zijn langdurige juridische procedures voor nodig om een dergelijk patent ongedaan te maken we vragen de europese gemeenschap om een diepgaand onderzoek in te stellen naar dit patent van accell dat naar onze mening ten onrechte is verstrekt onze vraag is waarom is dit patent ondertekend wetende dat het handelde over allang bestaande onderdelen

5233092 something that stood out in the latest survey was that those who already owned a portable navigation device pnd showed only a slight preference toward paying to have these services on their pnd rather than on their mobile phone
5233093 there is already quite high acceptance in principle that even key driving related location services would be delivered to the phone
5233094 it is clear that pnd vendors will have to adapt quickly to the rising threat posed by phone based navigation solutions and location based services even if most of those gps phones today are not being used for vehicle navigation

5233125 av while allowing for that type of battle is not designed for that as their own video showed the video square enix gave to us explaining how to kill it gave us one of 2 possible solutions and after 3 years shows just how vague and dismissive ses dev team can be either you cheat using dev commands multiple 2hr ability use in under 2hours or a 10 hour battle
5233126 warden isnt setup to allow lots of different people around the world to help kill it you get 18 people no more think of it as a ks99 fight in terms of how people enter the zone to kill it
5233127 lets have a monster that people can log in and find out is being fought and come join
5233128 maybe if they were good at the game it wouldent take them 18 hours
5233129 oh neat that would be great if ffxi had that
5233130 just a little further ok the next one has to be the next one
5233131 lets just see how ed up twisted and impossible we can make this boss i bet you someone will attempt it
5233132 3rd shift forms 12 16 or something neh otherwise doesnt seem fair or feasible to me without physical and mental strain which is not a good thing in this case
5233133 this is the eighth year in succession that the company has made a profit a record we are extremely proud of
5233134 it demonstrates that we are able to manage our own business in the most difficult of circumstances and is essential in order to maintain the clubs ongoing financial stability

5233139 prove that in 2003 barack obama as chairman of an illinois state senate committee voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language copied from a federal bill passed by congress without objection in 2002 explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion
5233140 how many laws are there in illinois related to abortion which ones protect the lives of babies born alive after an abortion
5233141 what does barack hussein obama who is now set to become the democrat nomination for presidential candidate of the united states have in common with so called bioethicists such as peter singer and joseph fletcher
5233142 how long do you think it would take to kill all 150 of us it would be a bloodbath
5233143 when you have good guys with guns the bad guys do less damage
5233144 weve had a very disturbing trend of school shootings in the us
5233145 it is my belief this is caused by making schools gun free zones when schools were made gun free zones they became targets for people who wanted to rack up the body count
5233146 its up there with the worst ideas in the history of education
5233147 you could have a gun accidentally taken away or a gun could be dislodged or discharged while a teachers breaking up a fight in the cafeteria
5233148 allowing armed staff and teachers will provide a last line of defence if other security measures at the school fail
5233149 officers cant be everywhere and in an emergency every second counts
5233150 when you hear about these shootings the reports always start out with this is a sleepy little place nobody thought this would ever happen here

5233152 i hadnt realized how much my chemistry with him since titanic would still stick
5233153 such a show of violence is pushing kashmiri people especially our youth toward revolution
5233154 at this point i think the international community has to step in otherwise we fear a growing extremism this kind of anger comes at the worst time
5233155 pakistan has to put its political house in order before we can say what it means for kashmir
5233156 when i talked to president bush he told me all of americas proud of me and then he told me to give my mom a hug and tell her the president sent it

5233181 aligned the fact he was paying for the tauranga electoral petition with the political party whose leader ran it
5233182 the position is i have not rendered a fee note to the solicitor for the work done and that solicitor has not rendered a bill to winston until my instructing solicitor renders a bill to winston there is no debt owed by winston

5233189 i am not speaking for my party i am speaking for myself as an individual i do support anwar ibrahim in this by election i am not actually supporting him too much as an individual but more on the movement that he leads
5233190 i feel if anwar is elected to parliament the voices of the opposition will be stronger and the chances of strengthening the democracy and widening the democratic space will be better for these reason i support him
5233191 the associated press totally steals my black conservatives on obama story
5233192 then the same guy came back and walked towards nilanthan and threw a punch
5233193 he must have had a blade in his hand because he ended up with a slashed throat
5233194 we really need to trace the driver of the cab as he may hold the key to the identity of the suspect
5233195 it is not known at this time what the argument was about either with the cab driver or the group but anyone with information about the incident should call us
5233196 unfortunately we see no signs that the russians are starting to pull out or even preparing to withdraw from georgia
5233197 there is no real sign of a withdrawal so it is difficult to understand what is going on with the russians
5233198 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5233199 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5233200 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way

5233207 in america every citizens vote should count the court has tossed aside one of the most important rights we have as americans
5233208 oregon voters deserve to be heard on this referendum more than enough oregonians signed the petitions for it the people didnt thwart this effort government bureaucracy did that is a dangerous precedent for the future of the democratic process in america
5233209 although regulations on the referendum process implicate the fundamental right to vote the states important interests justify the minimal burden on plaintiffs rights
5233210 no county gave notice to voters with rejected signatures the counties also refused to consider extrinsic evidence presented by voters
5233211 oregons important interests justify this minimal burden on the right to vote
5233212 swept under the carpet out of sight out of mind
5233213 the gay agenda its dividing the family the church and a nation
5233214 i think mccain has to have a running mate that clearly connects with social conservatives in the party that is where he is lacking so if he picks a pro choice running mate i dont see how he can win this race
5233215 im not going to say people will stay home but there is a core of voters whose level of enthusiasm influences people further from the core so if mccain picks a pro choice running mate the strength of turnout on election day is not going to be there for him
5233216 it doesnt matter im a believer that john mccain cant win the race but that obama has to lose it this is not a knock on mccain i dont know of any republican candidate who can overcome the democrats in this environment without the democrat disqualifying himself
5233217 but mccain has to remain an acceptable alternative if voters do disqualify obama santorum continued
5233218 so his vp choice has to be safe somebody who cant disqualify mccain at the same time he cant tick off conservatives the answer long story short hes got to pick a safe conservative republican there are probably ten members of the u s senate and some governors who are conservative who have solid records who are good people who would not stir controversy
5233219 surely mccain and his advisors know that the choice of ridge or any other pro abortion politician would cost him the election
5233220 the religious and social conservative base of the gop would be completely dispirited they would vote for mccain but thats about it
5233221 worrying is like a rocking chair you keep moving but it doesnt get you anywhere
5233222 its uncommon to see people dressed up like this so the victims were watching them
5233223 hey take a look at this try it out for a bit
5233224 i think at this point youd have to say the hill gets a lot steeper to climb
5233225 they had their day in court they had their due process of law the same due process that they tried to deprive a person who they shot in the back
5233226 whether the defendants were justified in shooting aldrete davila is an issue no longer in play after the jury verdict that rejected the defendants version of the facts
5233227 i dont have a crystal ball but there are some serious issues that justify re hearing
5233228 it looks increasingly like the presidents the only one constitutionally to be able to do something about it
5233229 i dont know that for a fact its hard to get them to respond to anything regarding these two border patrol agents
5233230 this case is about the rule of law we had to follow the facts where they led
5233231 its going to take us the better part of a month to two months with two people working around the clock to handle opening the letters and counting the checks
5233232 people just dont want to get behind us for some kind of fear because theres so much hate for the border patrol in el paso

5233248 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5233249 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5233250 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5233251 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

5233254 you know one or two might slip through but its a good deal
5233255 you could tell he was emotional and this was really coming from his heart
5233256 he was the john wayne type and youd go to hell and back with him
5233257 inspired respect and attention he motivated his men and led by example whenever there was a mission he was there up front he took care of his men and kept them informed
5233258 love him like a father he taught me discipline he taught me never to surrender
5233259 he was best man at my wedding in 1975 and we were supposed to go to laos together
5233260 but they sent me to africa for two years after that i was working with him locally and internationally
5233261 it took 10 years to pull the book out of him
5233262 he never said anything about his exploits but he talked about how bravely the men fought he never had a note and could have you crying at the end it would get to the soul of the people listening
5233263 somebody who is recognized and admired by people who arent even sports fans
5233264 but it has been difficult for him too even though he does not go out often wherever he goes he sees his own picture in the streets there is great pressure he withstands psychological pressure no other athlete can withstand
5233265 its awful its just an unfortunate injury at the worst possible time
5233266 last year 188 men graduated from seal training of 35 000 who joined the navy
5233267 i have only met a couple of cooks and truck drivers from the vietnam war most were hunting vietcong snipers in the elephant grass
5233268 claiming medals that havent been earned is a crime but these guys know they can get away with it
5233269 we dont turn in the guy down the street who is wearing the purple heart at the parade
5233270 but if he has a medal of honor hanging on his wall and hes leading the parade and talking at the local school we might go to the fbi
5233271 they really want to be the hero elite and they forget that it takes every member of the military to make a mission successful
5233272 it doesnt matter whether they are the clerk typing in orders or the cook making meals or the guy on the front lines
5233273 they think its a victimless crime and its not they leave a wake of victims
5233274 its a huge travesty for the real men who earned it
5233275 with a passion for life a strong woman caught up in the torrent of historical turmoil and drowned
5233276 he could have testified but he just flew back stateside to his american family
5233277 we all knew he slept in the house many times the baby looks like the father
5233278 the south korean police and prosecutors hated her because she was the lover of lee gang kook and then of col baird and nobody could touch her they waited for their chance
5233279 they would send her right back to the torture chamber
5233280 i just needed to be with someone who was in the courtroom with her
5233281 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5233282 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis
5233283 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
5233284 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
5233285 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing
5233286 god ordained marriage between man and woman and if you claim that you are a homosexual and still a christian you must admit that god calls it a sin
5233287 the man must die the whole assembly must stone him outside the camp
5233288 in 1tim and 1cor means homosexual conclusion thru legalism all practicing homosexuals are sinners prophet some sins do not need to be manifested physically to be a sin seems to me that tom cruises minority report
5233289 oh yeah were dating but we dont have sex so we are not being immoral
5233290 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5233291 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5233292 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5233293 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5233294 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5233295 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5233296 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5233297 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually

5233300 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5233301 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5233302 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5233303 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5233307 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5233308 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5233309 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5233325 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5233326 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5233327 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5233328 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5233329 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5233330 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5233331 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5233332 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5233333 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5233334 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5233335 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years

5233337 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5233338 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5233339 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5233340 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience

5233342 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5233343 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5233344 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5233345 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5233346 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5233347 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5233348 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5233349 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5233350 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5233351 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5233352 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5233353 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5233354 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5233355 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5233356 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5233357 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5233358 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5233359 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5233360 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5233361 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5233362 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5233363 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5233364 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5233365 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5233366 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5233367 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5233368 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5233369 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5233370 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5233371 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5233372 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5233373 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5233374 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5233375 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5233376 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5233377 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5233378 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5233379 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5233380 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5233381 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5233382 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5233383 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5233384 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5233385 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5233386 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5233387 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5233388 s avonds was ik wel eens eenzaam en kon ik zomaar uren met vriendinnen aan de telefoon hangen
5233389 and dont you ever forget it im the man who wears the pants in this family

5233394 sometimes people think it is a bit geeky a bit beard and sandals
5233395 but there is a younger generation coming through who are more into extreme machines and there are some really flashy vehicles

5233404 local students put on a show demonstrating how eclipses work
5233405 as part of the project they had to calculate the geometry of a simulated eclipse the shadow made by their classroom globe for instance had to be 38 times the size of the globe itself to match earths actual shadow then they had to find a local building with the right orientation and architecture for shadow casting the new church of san giovanni near trieste italy was selected for this purpose
5233406 the final result was a projected shadow so perfectly matching the real earth one that the student holding the globe seemed to be the real actor responsible of the ongoing eclipse
5233407 that sound was a radio echo caused by distant radio stations bouncing off the meteors trail

5233411 this is worrying evidence of the continuing attempts of paramilitaries to exert influence over their communities and i will be looking for an assurance from the police that they will robustly pursue and deal with those paramilitary groups responsible for these horrific attacks
5233412 under the control of the uvf leadership but not accessible for use by members
5233413 they said a thing in the statement it even galled me to read it out but i read it out anyhow that the arms had been bunkered beyond reach and the general de chastelain had been contacted i told them i said that means nothing
5233414 i said why not take the ultimate step it wouldnt only add to the statement it would make the statement the weapons are finished
5233415 now i look forward if i am still living to stand on some podium to say that the uvf have decommissioned their weapons that would be my dream that would be i suppose the icing on the cake
5233416 if you are the leader you lead from the front perhaps maybe after consultation you have to have the confidence in yourself the confidence in your men to say im making a direct order here that uvf arms will be dispensed with decommissioned call it what you want i expect every man to obey that
5233417 it is critical that everyone involved pulls together to seek a way out of this crisis
5233418 to stand on some podium to say that the uvf have decommissioned
5233419 it would be amazing to be racing in home waters in 2012
5233420 we cant describe what we have been through these last four years and two for pippa
5233421 winning a second olympic gold medal is absolutely awesome and were all overwhelmed to be honest
5233422 the only call i remember making was at about 400 metres to go i shouted gold
5233423 everything was burning and i was in a dark place but i came out the other side of it smiling
5233424 im really proud of what ive done im just disappointed with the medal we got thats all
5233425 weve just won an olympic silver medal and i just rowed in the most enjoyable crew i ever rowed in the best nine guys and the best two coaches i couldnt ask for a better olympic experience
5233426 it was just crazy i hope this medal is a stepping stone for british gymnastics and it will inspire youngsters to come into our sport
5233427 you need to be a certain shape and he has very long arms with a slender body a good aesthetic line
5233428 he really is an amazing competitor beijing was not really on our target sheet the plans were for 2012 because he will be at the age when you expect him to peak so this has come as a real bonus
5233429 hes a good all round gymnast especially on the pommel horse
5233430 i remember the meeting i had with his mum when he first joined he had just got a scholarship to a choral school he has a very good voice and she was in a dilemma i am glad he chose gymnastics
5233431 under the control of the uvf leadership but not accessible for use by members
5233432 they said a thing in the statement it even galled me to read it out but i read it out anyhow that the arms had been bunkered beyond reach and the general de chastelain had been contacted
5233433 i said why not take the ultimate step it wouldnt only add to the statement
5233434 now i look forward if i am still living to stand on some podium to say that the uvf have decommissioned their weapons that would be my dream that would be i suppose the icing on the cake

5233436 actually this filly has been training out of this world
5233437 ive been aboard just about every time she has worked and i told paddy i thought she was going to run a huge race
5233438 today she settled really good she had a good pace to run at and i had a great trip i got lucky down the stretch to find some room to run and got it done
5233439 i think you have to take a shot when theyre doing as well as she was
5233440 today they went a little quick the first part and that gave her a chance to relax she had a nice kick today which she showed in her first race she showed that again today so that was very encouraging
5233441 this was much more satisfying than winning the silver in athens
5233442 today its all about elation and were proud and relieved we just got on with it
5233443 we tried to stay as calm and flat as possible
5233444 we went out today saying this is not about emotion it is about making the right decisions its been a pretty full on week
5233445 his logic is that since mugabe is saying the deal currently on the table gives the prime minister a lot of powers then he must assume that position and tsvangirai becomes president
5233446 we had a good chat with andrew and his agent gerry carlisle on saturday evening and well wait to hear back from them
5233447 he is a player we are very keen to bring to the club but the deal has to be right for everyone concerned
5233448 we have offered the best deal we can but im sure his agent will want to get him the best deal possible which is fair enough
5233449 andrew is a player we have wanted for a long time but the search for front men continues
5233450 even if we can agree the transfer of andrew i will still be hoping to sign one or hopefully two forwards before the transfer window shuts
5233451 last week had nothing to do with this game my only concern was for the safety of the players
5233452 after consultations with legal advisers and close political supporters and on their advice im taking the decision of resigning
5233453 my resignation will go to the speaker of the national assembly today
5233454 in afghanistan whether it is forced or not forced it is a crime because the islamic rules say that it is
5233455 i think it is good there are many diseases that can be created in todays world such as hiv through illegal sexual relations
5233456 when i first came to jail i cried so much blood was coming out of my mouth my husbands brother told me he would give my children back when i came out of jail but he has become a talib nobody comes to see us in jail there are a lot of diseases
5233457 the ones who killed my husband they have money and they threw me in jail i am 100 per cent innocent i have no one no brother to look after me
5233458 there is a dangerous tendency to accept in afghanistan practices which would not be countenanced elsewhere because of cultural differences and local traditions
5233459 they are very aware of the inequality in the system
5233460 the most refreshing thing is that there are plans coming from the department of womens affairs it is not just us pushing our ideas on to them
5233461 please please take our words somewhere where people will be kind and help us

5233481 im a big fan of the whole harry potter series and i am surprised daniel radcliffe suffers from dyspraxia
5233482 he clearly suffers from a mild form but the fact he shows no sign of it at all is a great tribute to his acting skills and makes him a role model for other people with this condition
5233483 in the majority of children and young people with dyspraxia we cannot find the cause so the basic treatment is occupational therapy teaching them to make a plan for their actions and rehearse their movements
5233484 theres nothing in the green paper that comes within a bulls roar of socialist left doctrine

5233492 if i am told that i am kashmiri then i am kashmiri
5233493 there is no government nothing only people on the roads thats all
5233494 it was just all so fine from the indian point of view you had the kashmiri separatists almost isolated
5233495 everything was moving so beautifully and then these guys start playing electoral politics it was one of the best times after the militancy but now it has gone back to the 90s phase
5233496 i think the chief minister was hoping the issue would get him some votes in the jammu region and they didnt bargain on the kind of response that they got
5233497 now on both sides in jammu and kashmir it has gotten far beyond the land issue

5233527 what we want to do is gear this toward the moms
5233528 its the moms who really need information and calming down their lives are kind of turned upside down
5233529 its what our grandmothers did literally combing it out one at a time our market is people who dont want to be bothered with it or dont care how much it costs
5233530 right after school it was going around madisons circle of friends she had so many there was no way i was going to have the time to deal with it
5233531 were already seeing it start to ramp up from summer camps
5233532 and blockbuster movies where lice are transferred from theater seat backs this summer have been our friend
5233533 it caused more alarm and anxiousness as parents didnt know how to identify it
5233534 by inviting them in to educate them and to help do two lice checks a year it kind of turned the whole issue around we saw a substantial decrease in the number of students
5233535 the issue is that people dont want to use a lot of the traditional treatments that were pesticide based
5233536 once you use those the removal still takes a lot of time
5233537 this is something they can do at home all it takes is a fine toothed lice comb good light and patience
5233538 i have real mixed emotions on it i hate to see small children here
5233539 we give tonnes of stuff away to people in need most of those people have kids
5233540 a lot of families are struggling rents are so high that once theyve paid them theyre lucky if they have enough money for food for a week or two
5233541 they dont have disposable income all of it goes to paying off bills
5233542 many kids are so malnourished that they cant pay attention in class
5233543 can you imagine being poor and walking into the supermarket and seeing things from far and wide and theres no way you can afford them
5233544 i see a lot of sickness i see a lot of anxiety among parents who just cant provide
5233545 i see people coming in multiple times for things like milk and bread
5233546 the thinking is if i can save 100 a month by going to the food bank thats going to leave me with more money for other necessities
5233547 fredericton is a beautiful city its a white collar government community and sometimes people dont see whats right in front of them
5233548 it is going to be very difficult to try and fit it all in we are only a couple of weeks into the new season and already we are looking at fixture congestion
5233549 we have a county antrim shield game on tuesday night to deal with and then the setanta cup games are coming up very soon
5233550 the players just want to get off and running unfortunately weve had this two weeks in a row now and we just want to play football
5233551 when the games are going to be played is something i just dont know so well just have to wait and see when they are scheduled for
5233552 its not an ideal position to be in the games are going to pile up but other teams will have the same problem and its just something that we are going to have to deal with

5233557 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5233558 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5233559 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5233560 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5233561 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5233562 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5233563 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5233564 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted

5233566 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5233567 there was just an outside possibility that any changes could be implemented by june 2009 if the government decided that local elections were to be combined with elections to the european parliament
5233568 a fully worked up and evidenced electoral scheme for new electoral divisions based on that council size i e 123
5233569 the boundary committee for england says that it cannot find the time to carry out the electoral review and yet does not intend to start the consultation on the proposal for a 123 member council until november this is unacceptable they just need to get on with the review and stop prevaricating
5233570 the proposals for the new council include twenty area networks which respect the boundaries of the proposed electoral divisions if elections are held on the county councils old divisions it will completely undermine the local arrangements for the new council
5233571 it is ridiculous to expect local people to take part in a consultation on a 123 member council only for them to have to vote for new councillors on different boundaries
5233572 if they unwilling to do this central government needs to ensure that the electoral review is speeded up and if necessary the existence of cornwall county council and the district councils is extended for three four months until the democratic arrangements are in place for the new council
5233573 this is obviously a violation of the principle of action for action essential for realizing denuclearization
5233574 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday
5233575 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5233576 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5233577 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5233578 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5233579 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5233580 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else

5233584 id go straight to the bottom and probably die of hypothermia
5233585 i suppose with politicians its a case of sink or swim and im not so sure id take responsibility for that but they are still welcome
5233586 myself and davy were eager to get it going because of last week and all the hype that has surrounded the league you have to commend the referee because he went with our call but in hindsight maybe it shouldnt have started
5233587 both sets of players deserve a lot of credit because they did try and make a game of it in horrendous conditions but after a while it was starting to become a farce i think the call was 100 per cent correct in the end
5233588 it was beginning to get a bit dangerous out on the pitch and i think the smaller players like tommy mccallion and steven ferguson were getting concerned that they were going to drown
5233589 it didnt seem too bad at kick off and the rain had eased slightly but then it rained quite persistently for the full half hour
5233590 we trust the review of the 24 000 caseload would mean a vindication of our fathers quality of work at the miramichi hospital
5233591 the results will indeed greatly allay public anxiety and restore a little faith in a profession that has been the subject of intense scrutiny lately
5233592 we are working on a report and there will be an update but i cant give a specific time
5233593 fra had the crowd packed with constituents from the lower falls
5233594 he had it won before he even got on stage
5233595 first off i have to watch what i say but i was very very disappointed in the standard of some of the decisions which were made
5233596 i felt the dismissal of ryan semple was very bad because he only flicked the ball away
5233597 i know referees have a hard job to do but i just want a level of consistency
5233598 i said before the game that i didnt want my side to be bullied whenever we are at home we need to have a bit of pride in our performance and everything i asked for i got on saturday the work ethic in my team was great
5233599 i have lads in my changing room who are so disappointed that you would think we lost but i told them that they have to remember we played with just nine men for the final 25 minutes so i cant praise my players enough for their battling spirit
5233600 if it had have been a boxing match it would have been stopped after an hour
5233601 we totally battered them all day long and they scored with the one and only time they got in our half
5233602 im furious with my players that we didnt take our chances
5233603 a falta de transpar ncia com rela o tramita o do projeto de lei que disp e sobre a carreira de defensor p blico
5233604 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5233605 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis
5233606 sorry if that doesnt answer your question thoroughly enough we want to keep moving and go to the next question but if youre still not clear we can definitely talk about it after the service
5233607 with a passion for life a strong woman caught up in the torrent of historical turmoil and drowned
5233608 he could have testified but he just flew back stateside to his american family
5233609 we all knew he slept in the house many times the baby looks like the father
5233610 the south korean police and prosecutors hated her because she was the lover of lee gang kook and then of col baird and nobody could touch her they waited for their chance
5233611 they would send her right back to the torture chamber
5233612 i just needed to be with someone who was in the courtroom with her
5233613 last year 188 men graduated from seal training of 35 000 who joined the navy
5233614 i have only met a couple of cooks and truck drivers from the vietnam war most were hunting vietcong snipers in the elephant grass
5233615 claiming medals that havent been earned is a crime but these guys know they can get away with it
5233616 we dont turn in the guy down the street who is wearing the purple heart at the parade
5233617 but if he has a medal of honor hanging on his wall and hes leading the parade and talking at the local school we might go to the fbi
5233618 they really want to be the hero elite and they forget that it takes every member of the military to make a mission successful
5233619 it doesnt matter whether they are the clerk typing in orders or the cook making meals or the guy on the front lines
5233620 they think its a victimless crime and its not they leave a wake of victims
5233621 its a huge travesty for the real men who earned it
5233622 weve got to make the play offs first and weve still got some work to do
5233623 weve got to turn up against hull kr next monday and get the job done and we intend to do that
5233624 you could tell he was emotional and this was really coming from his heart
5233625 he was the john wayne type and youd go to hell and back with him
5233626 inspired respect and attention he motivated his men and led by example whenever there was a mission he was there up front he took care of his men and kept them informed
5233627 love him like a father he taught me discipline he taught me never to surrender
5233628 he was best man at my wedding in 1975 and we were supposed to go to laos together
5233629 but they sent me to africa for two years after that i was working with him locally and internationally
5233630 it took 10 years to pull the book out of him
5233631 he never said anything about his exploits but he talked about how bravely the men fought he never had a note and could have you crying at the end it would get to the soul of the people listening

5233643 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century

5233682 controlling the conformation of peptides is not easy our previous studies showed that soft landing can be used to prepare ultrapure peptide layers on substrates
5233683 the question we faced was in addition to controlling purity can we also control the structure of the molecules we showed we could
5233684 we can be quite certain that the decline in rainfall has been substantial and will continue to be
5233685 this 15 percent decrease every 20 25 years is likely to continue
5233686 i lost six positions in turn one when i was almost forced off track then on lap three lai pushed me wide losing me three positions
5233687 as a result i lost touch with the guys up ahead and effectively it cost me a points scoring finish
5233688 on lap nine of 20 i began to lose the front and with half the race remaining i knew it was going to be a struggle to catch baldolini for 15th
5233689 at the finish i was surprised to see that i finished just 46 seconds back from the race winner which shows progress however id much rather have some points to show for my efforts
5233690 i dont know how we have lost that game being honest
5233691 weve had the best chances havent we with three one on ones really you have to convert them dont you
5233692 they were hanging on at the end but we didnt push the ball over the line amid a tatty first half the decisive goal came on 22 minutes a shot from the edge of the box creeping in
5233693 of course we hope its not the same or the start of the same away form as last year said wilson
5233694 but at the same time you cannot look backwards its gone now
5233695 looking back wont do anyone any good but i have to say this game was reminiscent of other games we have had pools were let down last season by their away form results didnt match performances
5233696 i hope our away form is an improvement on last season what this game has proved is you have to stick the ball in the net said wilson
5233697 there wasnt a great deal between the sides that goal aside and it proved the difference
5233698 we had some terrific midfield running and play at times but you have to put the ball in the net
5233699 those areas with the quality those boys have its about making a clinical decision when you get in that situation and we werent clinical enough
5233700 then david foley could have hit the back of the net but he spurned it wide
5233701 were quite close and his name might be a surprise to some people when they hear where he has come from
5233702 we always keep things close to our chest we dont tell anybody who were bringing in or where they are from as that can lead to disappointment if it doesnt come off
5233703 when alan shouted that he would have to come off i thought he was struggling with his groin
5233704 it meant ian came back into the team he did well on tuesday and was unfortunate not to start today but was excellent
5233705 he is quicker than alan and steve but i dont think he quite reads the game as well as the other two and his distribution isnt as good either
5233706 but he is getting there and its not that long since he was playing in non league
5233707 im not sure if billys shot went over the line people in the stands will have had a better view than me
5233708 they had a chance when their striker delroy facey went around our keeper and missed an open goal but in general i think we were the better side
5233709 we just needed a break in the final third we didnt get it when jason had that shot that hit the post
5233710 now that tommy has gone we no longer have that option to release the ball early
5233711 weve always wanted to get the ball down and pass it to be brave on the ball
5233712 we said the same last season but with not having that chance to play the ball up to tommy it is making us pass
5233713 were attacking at speed now breaking with pace weve got pooley and griff getting up and down on the wings but sometimes we need a bit more care in the final third
5233714 weve had a tough week because we travelled away twice we got back late after playing at walsall and it was tough on notts county too because their game went to extra time
5233715 you could see where it affected the game because it got stretched in the second half
5233716 we might have been better off losing one game if we had won the other as we would have had three points and not two
5233717 but the performances have been pleasing the tempo is better than last year so if we carry on playing like that then the results will come
5233718 you have heard about twitter maybe its something other people do mainly younger people you subscribe to the service then you can post little messages on peoples cellphones or on their instant message accounts about nothing

5233741 military people need to have certain protections when theyre off trying to serve us in a war
5233742 one of the rights under the scra is that you cant foreclose on them
5233743 it doesnt take a genius to read a paper that says hey hes in the military
5233744 it looks to me like the bank screwed up badly and needs to make things right
5233745 the most typical case that we see is the bank is given notice of the service members activation sends them back a nice letter that says thank you for your service to the country and somehow theres a miscommunication between the banks legal department and the banks payment center and they put the mortgage for foreclosure
5233746 as opposed to something that a bank sees day in and day out this is something that comes up in an irregular fashion

5233768 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5233769 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5233770 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are uphappy with their lot
5233771 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
5233772 and really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan

5233895 lose win is no worse than win lose because it has no standards no demands no expectations no vision people who think lose win are usually quick to please or appease they seek strength from popularity or acceptance they have little courage to express their own feelings and convictions and are easily intimidated by the ego strength of others

5233961 the council can prosecute people who fail to comply with their duty of care and whose waste ends up being dumped
5233962 this is a serious offence which can carry heavy penalties we will now be continuing our investigation to find the offenders who actually tipped the waste

5233974 we want to be part of shaping peoples lives by fulfilling their goals and giving them a sense of value and satisfaction
5233975 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5233976 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5233977 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5233978 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5233979 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5233980 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5233981 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5233982 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5233983 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5233984 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5233985 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5233986 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5233987 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

5233996 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5233997 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5233998 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5233999 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama

5234001 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5234002 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5234003 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5234004 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5234005 many in the christian right tend to get their information

5234018 the job of government is to act on behalf of the interests of the people of scotland

5234020 this report is even worse than we feared and shows what a shambles the uks biofuels policies have become
5234021 here is yet more proof direct from a uk government body that voluntary environmental and social standards just arent working these standards must be strengthened and made compulsory before targets are raised any further
5234022 the industry has been allowed to answer i dont know to many sustainability questions that isnt good enough and could mean habitat destruction and the massive release of greenhouse gases is going on unreported and undetected it should mean all plans for raising biofuels targets should be dropped
5234023 in just one months time europes politicians are likely to agree to a much higher 10 per cent target for biofuel use yet todays report proves these fuels are doing little good
5234024 the uk government should use the report and last months damning gallagher review of the indirect impacts of biofuels to persuade the rest of europe to drop that target because current biofuels are destroying precious wildlife sites while doing nothing to tackle climate change

5234029 why vote theres no good economic rationale for going to the polls so what is it that drives the democratic instinct
5234030 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
5234031 a testament to the american spirit that im even standing here before you

5234046 a lottery and you know that with lotteries you lose most of the time
5234047 theres nothing like taking a nice quiet bomb apart to steady the nerves
5234048 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5234049 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5234050 since man lives by the permission of physical geography it is his fate to be divided by mountains rivers and seas into groups that develop in semi isolation their diverging languages and creeds their climatically conditioned features customs and dress
5234051 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare

5234053 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5234054 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5234055 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5234056 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
5234057 in the summer of 2007 as arctic sea ice reached a record low the northwest passage opened between baffin bay and mcclure strait also known as mclure strait passing through parry channel this opening would be the route through the arctic most conducive to large scale shipping as of early august 2008 arctic sea ice was not expected to set a new melt record although its extent was well below the long term average whether the northwest passage would open as far north as it did the previous year remained in question but the sea ice in a more southerly route one taken by norwegian explorer roald amundsen in the early twentieth century had begun to melt
5234058 pete your just a denier the register didnt just make numbers up out of thin air they based on research from people who you know actually study the climate once again this doesnt fit your meme and mindset im hear to free ideologs like you and brian from your mind set

5234067 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
5234068 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
5234069 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
5234070 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
5234071 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
5234072 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5234073 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5234074 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope

5234079 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5234080 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5234081 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5234082 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5234083 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5234084 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5234085 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power

5234090 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

5234108 wir haben im sitzen miteinander geschlafen es ging ganz schnell ich habe schon h ufig daran gedacht mit ihm zu schlafen wei t du ich habe ihn schon h ufig begehrt fr her schon immer wieder wenn ich in dieses dorf gekommen bin er war immer so still wei t du ich habe mich gefragt was ein mensch er ist was mag er f hlen wenn er mich ansieht
5234109 ich habe ihn verf hrt wei t du ich habe ihn gek sst ich habe ihn gestreichelt ich habe es mir h ufig vorgestellt ich denke immer noch daran wie ich seinen r cken streichle er ist sportler fu baller er hat einen sehr harten r cken sehr muskul s es hat mich geschreckt am anfang man hat jeden muskel gesehen an seinem bauch an seinen oberschenkeln wie eine statue dachte ich eine griechische statue wei t du alles was er tat war falsch er ber hrt mich falsch dachte ich er k sst mich falsch er sieht mich falsch an er hat seinen kopf auf meine br ste gelegt wei t du und ist eingeschlafen ich habe meine augen geschlossen ich habe an dich gedacht wie sch n du bist dachte ich wie deine k sse schmecken und wie du aussiehst wenn du erregt bist wie du mich ber hrst dabei habe ich seinen kopf gestreichelt bis er geschlafen hat dann bin ich gegangen
5234110 ja so war das aber es war nicht alles wir haben uns wieder gesehen an einem sonntag wir waren tanzen er hat mich lange gehalten bei der begr ung dann hat er mich ignoriert er hat nicht mit mir gesprochen er hat mich nicht angesehen am n chsten morgen standen wir in seiner haust r ich bin ihm gefolgt wei t du aber es war sein k rper der zu mir wollte wir standen da bis ich sagte ich geh jetzt in dein bett wenn du willst kannst du ja mitkommen er hat meinen mantel hochgeschoben und mich gestreichelt wir haben uns ausgezogen er hat mich nicht angesehen ich glaube er hat das bild seiner ex freundin betrachtet ich habe ihn gefragt ob er mich ein wenig gern h tte aber ja hat er gesagt es hat mir gereicht es war genug f r mich er hat ganz langsam mit mir geschlafen zart er hat sich viel m he gegeben ja ich dachte nicht dass ich kommen w rde und doch beim ersten mal bin ich nicht gekommen wei t du jetzt fange ich an ihn zu vergessen ich wei nicht mehr wie sein gesicht aussieht wie seine muskeln sich angef hlt haben ich kann mich nicht erinnern wie seine haare fielen und ob er eine narbe auf der nase hatte wie hat er mich angefasst
5234111 ich versuche mich manchmal zu erinnern wenn ich im bett liege es ist als w re es schon lange her wei t du ich wei nur die fr hen bilder bevor wir miteinander geschlafen haben ich wei noch er ist nicht sch n er hat ein breites lachen er hat schwarze haare ich wei nur dinge die jeder wei wie mag er sich angef hlt haben in mir
5234112 in k rnten ist in den vergangenen f nf jahren viel getan worden um neue arbeitspl tze zu schaffen und die kaufkraft zu st rken unsere bem hungen hatten erfolg wie j ngste daten beweisen k rnten kann mehr besch ftigte weniger arbeitslose und eine h here kaufkraft verzeichnen wir befinden sich auf dem richtigen weg
5234113 die gleiche positive tendenz zeichnet sich auch f r das jahr 2008 ab mit 222 606 besch ftigten ende juli kann k rnten den h chsten besch ftigungsstand der geschichte aufweisen es ist uns gelungen nachhaltig unsere wirtschaftsstruktur zu erneuern besonders erfreulich ist der starke r ckgang bei der jugendarbeitslosigkeit so waren im ersten halbjahr 2008 um 10 5 prozent weniger jungendliche auf jobsuche als im vorjahr k rnten hat nach wien nieder sterreich und steiermark die niedrigste jugendarbeitslosigkeitsrate in sterreich
5234114 in sachen kaufkraft hat k rnten das burgenland und die steiermark berholt die ursachen daf r liegen in den vielen einkommenst rkenden ma nahmen wie teuerungs ausgleich billigdieselaktion m tter kinder und babygeld die in k rnten umgesetzt worden sind aber auch in den neuen bet tigungsfeldern der k rntnerinnen und k rntner so haben viele betriebe aus der technologiesparte in k rnten arbeitspl tze geschaffen und die zahlen bessere l hne hier werden wir weiter machen k rnten wird seine erfolgreiche wirtschafts und arbeitsmarktpolitik weiter fortsetzen
5234115 es geht der gro en koalition nur um macht einfluss und kontrolle und in keinster weise um die sicherung der gesundheit der menschen daher tragen auch sp und vp die verantwortung f r den derzeitigen schlechten zustand der krankenkassen

5234117 im system selbst steht eine milliarde euro f r die zuk nftige qualit t der medizinischen versorgung ohne neue beitragserh hungen ohne neue selbstbehalte und ohne zusch ssen aus steuergeldern sofort zur verf gung 1 durch eine vereinheitlichung der medizinischen grundversorgung sozialversicherungssysteme 300 mio euro einsparungspotential 2 durch eine bundesweite spitalsreform wie in ober sterreich 400 mio euro einsparungspotential 3 durch eine senkung der mehrwertsteuer auf medikamente von 20 auf 10 300 mio euro einsparungspotential

5234121 f r mich steht fest dass der mondsee in ffentlicher hand bestens aufgehoben w re dieses juwel ist f r ober sterreich sehr wichtig daher trete ich auch daf r ein dass das land aktiv einen erwerb des sees anstrebt ich kann mir dabei sowohl einen g nzlichen kauf durch das land aber auch einen gemeinsamen erwerb mit den bundesforsten vorstellen fest steht jedenfalls dass die ober sterreicherinnen und ober sterreicher diesen see lieber im ffentlichen eigentum s hen als in privater hand

5234123 der ausbau von anschlussbahnen soll zus tzliche transporte f r die schiene bringen und die weiterhin drohende verlagerung der g tertransporte auf die stra e verhindern
5234124 der massive mengenzuwachs bei den medikamenten bereitet im heurigen jahr weiterhin sorgen
5234125 die auf grund der guten konjunktur erfreuliche besch ftigung hat somit zwar zu einer besseren entwicklung der beitragseinnahmen gef hrt konnte aber die massive kostensteigerung im leistungsbereich bei weitem nicht ausgleichen
5234126 bei den ausgaben f r medikamente geht der trend zur ungebremsten mengen und kostenexplosion im heurigen jahr weiter
5234127 diese zahlen machen deutlich wie wichtig es f r die soziale krankenversicherung ist eine gesundheitsreform raschest umzusetzen
5234128 es gibt aber f r die patienten im hinblick auf die in diskussion stehenden ver nderungen keinen grund zur beunruhigung ich darf nur alle versicherten ersuchen sich am sorgsamen und wertbewussten umgang mit unserem hervorragenden sozialversicherungssystem zu beteiligen

5234140 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
5234141 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
5234142 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
5234143 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
5234144 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better
5234145 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate

5234148 few seem to realise that the present ipcc models predict almost unanimously that by 2040 the average summer in europe will be as hot as the summer of 2003 when over 30 000 died from heat by then we may cool ourselves with air conditioning and learn to live in a climate no worse than that of baghdad now but without extensive irrigation the plants will die and both farming and natural ecosystems will be replaced by scrub and desert what will there be to eat

5234163 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5234164 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5234165 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5234166 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5234167 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously

5234237 i know exactly what you think now i have been through this phase you will feel a sudden chill like the whole throat getting dry and heart getting frozen when you hear her voice after this long and because of the consciousness about your proposal i used to call my first love despite getting rejected just to feel that chill and still i feel it whenever i call or talk with her may be its intensity has subdued a bit because of time you have to get over it maaan you need to and think if there is something positive you will have new dreams we need our dreams to live we desperately need
5234238 i have been haunted by something since more than four years as i told you and its a new year resolution to solve it the next thing i say might be a shock to you i am in love with you ever since silence i felt so and this is not to convince you to respond now but i think it will be a great injustice to me and you if i continue to hide it from you so i tell you with all sincerity i possess

5234260 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5234261 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5234262 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5234263 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5234264 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5234265 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5234266 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5234267 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5234268 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5234269 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5234270 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5234271 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5234272 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5234273 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5234274 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5234275 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5234276 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5234277 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5234278 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years

5234280 i was fully aware of the challenge we just came up short
5234281 when you get to the semi final it is puck of the ball stuff exactly what it was today sunday
5234282 we didnt like doing what we did justin was a nice man and a good hurling man
5234283 but we thought we were just missing that little something that we werent sure that wed get out of justin
5234284 we felt that we needed something to get to an all ireland final
5234285 there are lads in their 30s that have never played in an all ireland final all they wanted to do was play in one
5234286 i suppose hard work is doing it both on and off the field
5234287 i dont think im as effective if i change the way i play because i wont put myself around and get in peoples faces and annoy people if you like
5234288 to be honest i had that problem with darlington last season and i did go off the ball but im not going to change the way i play ive always been a physical player and the manager brought me up here so you cant really change the player you brought in
5234289 ive never been intimidated my dad would give me a slap around the face if i ever did become intimidated ive been brought up that way and i wont shy away in a game and if i do annoy people along the way then so be it
5234290 it was a bit of handbags to be honest as far as im concerned it was a nothing thing we shook hands after the game and thats it
5234291 obviously celtic and rangers make it a more attractive league
5234292 those are the games you want to play in and thats up to the manager if he plays me or not
5234293 ive heard thats the big one thats the big rivalry i do like playing in derbies and that will be a nice feeling
5234294 we are delighted to have secured the services of harry and terry you couldnt pick two better english managers to comment on the national side to have their valued insight and opinions for these crucial england games is a real coup for setanta and completes a first class presenting line up which im sure viewers will enjoy
5234295 they kept themselves to themselves and led a very regimented life
5234296 this is a tragedy and they will be sadly missed
5234297 i was waiting at the arboretum on saturday afternoon and the lights must have changed about five times before i got over
5234298 the problem was cars were getting stuck in the middle and so when the lights change they are blocking the exits for other people and everyone was beeping it was like something out of the films in downtown new york
5234299 it was obvious something was going to give and then i saw these two men get out of their cars and begin taking swings at each other while everyone else just carried on beeping their horns
5234300 i didnt see the police i doubt they would have been able to get through the traffic anyway
5234301 i am a man of good character who has been collecting historic motorcycles for many years

5234323 they are used to seeing celebrity men but never expected their job would allow them to meet madonna
5234324 she spent four odd days and two full days filming at the venues and even roped in one of the crew as an extra in the filming
5234325 she showed a lot of interest in the various pole dancing tricks and even talked about learning some herself
5234326 she suggested that she may incorporate some of the moves in her next tour
5234327 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5234328 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5234329 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5234330 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy

5234336 leading a team of novice sailors in a race around the world is one of the hardest and most challenging jobs that any skipper could ever undertake and not everybody is up to this challenge

5234339 we are over the moon we had a really hard start and to come through is so pleasing that was the most intense race ive ever been involved in im so pleased
5234340 it is probably more sweet than athens because we were in with a chance of gold going into that race here we had to claw back a medal this has been a pretty hard olympics
5234341 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5234342 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5234343 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5234344 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5234345 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5234346 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5234347 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5234348 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5234349 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5234350 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5234351 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5234352 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5234353 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5234354 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5234355 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5234356 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5234357 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt

5234359 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5234360 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5234361 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5234362 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5234363 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star

5234365 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5234366 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5234367 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5234368 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5234369 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5234370 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5234371 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5234372 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5234373 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5234374 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5234375 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

5234384 i absolutely believe that if wed have had that election that gordon brown would no longer have been prime minister and that the conservatives would have been the largest party in a hung parliament
5234385 brown compounded calling off the election by then saying it was nothing to do with the polls which was a massive mistake it was a lie and it was treating people like fools
5234386 you appoint good people and trust their decisions but you have to know when to step in william hague has really helped me because he made all the mistakes the first time round
5234387 samantha is actually very unconventional and hard to put in a box she went to a day school was a goth at 14 had quite a wild childhood is unconventional and challenging and that is very good as it stopped me being too straight down the line
5234388 i tend to cry when im happy and i did then and then samantha started crying
5234389 sometimes maybe i put off making decisions that maybe i should have taken earlier
5234390 i remember going for a drink and it was just after john smith died and we said it will be blair who becomes leader and that will be disastrous for us
5234391 im a pretty classic church of england racked with doubt and scepticism believer
5234392 i think im canine rather than feline i like company i like people and that is much more dog like than cat like and im more of a dog lover
5234393 if you guys are going to run stuff and run every lie under the sun have somebody stand up for somebody
5234394 have me as a man who ended a relationship stand here and write some truth have me stand up for somebody and write that jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met
5234395 shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life and im going through something thats a very personal thing and you have to give that up
5234396 you have to give everything up because you cant have it all and it sucks
5234397 but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5234398 people are different they have different chemistry they have different lives
5234399 its not about years its about going out with somebody being truthful on the way in being truthful in the middle and being truthful on the way out
5234400 i guarantee you that 20 percent of the people on this street right now who are in a relationship wish they could get out but they dont know how and im going to be honest on the way in to my relationships and im going to be honest on the way out of my relationships

5234532 struggling to get by day to day and putting their long term plans on hold at a time in their lives when they should be building better for their future the rising cost of living combined with the debt they are carrying and makes paying bills and making ends meet a source of stress and struggle
5234533 they do not believe they have enough money to keep pace with the cost of living
5234534 they are entering their adult lives saddled with debilitating debt and a changing economy that offers fewer stable good paying jobs especially for young people without a college education
5234535 im sure playing the great defenses we play every week in the acc isnt going to help you put up gaudy numbers
5234536 florida state went through a run where they had a lot of really successful quarterbacks
5234537 so did miami prior to joining this conference when michael vick was at virginia tech he was a pretty lethal quarterback
5234538 its tough week in and week out going against quality defenses
5234539 virginia tech is a very good defense boston college florida state theyre all good its not like you can just go out there and put up good numbers because youre good
5234540 when you talk about speed in this league there are so many schools that are built and predicated on speed
5234541 and speed is the one thing that has a chance to give quarterbacks a bad time
5234542 i think there will be better numbers from quarterbacks around the league
5234543 we have a lot of experienced veteran quarterbacks coming back glennon and at virginia tech myself at florida state and obviously cullen at clemson i expect all of us to have really good years the guy at wake forest he should have a great year again skinners an extremely skilled and talented guy i think there will be really good quarterback play in the acc

5234550 only some of these players are grumbling and i dont think the concerns they have about the security in pakistan is based on sense reasoning or logic
5234551 it is an emotive reaction and i see it as emotional pressure being put on the icc and us but there is no way the icc or boards will accept this and the tournament will be held in pakistan as scheduled
5234552 all their fears are based on perception and not reality
5234553 i have a really exciting idea for a company and would like to arrange a meeting with you at your office next tuesday

5234574 the leopard was caught sunday near the forest reserve in the rampur matheli village of the district
5234575 we had deployed armed guards to restrict the leopard from entering the forest reserve and several cages were installed on various routes between the forest and the village
5234576 as the leopard had evaded us many times before this time we used a goat as a bait to trap it

5234578 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5234579 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5234580 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5234581 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5234582 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5234583 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution

5234632 rusia debe retirarse de georgia sin m s dilaci n
5234633 desde el inicio de las hostilidades francia y europa se implicaron plenamente en el terreno diplom tico la primera prioridad era obtener un alto el fuego para poner fin a los sufrimientos de la poblaci n y a las destrucciones adem s hab a que crear las condiciones para que fuera aceptado a la vez por los rusos y por los georgianos las largas conversaciones que mantuvimos con dimitri medvedev y vladimir putin en el kremlin y con mikja l saakashvili en tiblisi finalmente nos permitieron arrancar un acuerdo a las dos partes para un plan de seis puntos de salida de la crisis este plan no lo resolv a todo adem s no era se su objetivo pero ha consagrado el acuerdo de las partes al alto el fuego su firma por los presidentes medvedev y saakashvili y por m mismo en nombre de la uni n europea permite la retirada de las fuerzas rusas a sus posiciones anteriores al desencadenamiento de hostilidades conforme a las garant as que me ha dado el presidente medvedev esta retirada debe efectuarse sin dilaci n en mi opini n este punto no es negociable
5234634 aparte de la retirada queda mucho por hacer para estabilizar la situaci n de forma duradera una resoluci n del consejo de seguridad de la onu deber consolidar los primeros logros d ndoles una fuerza jur dica universal pero desde ahora ya podemos extraer una lecci n de esta crisis la uni n europea ha estado a la altura de los acontecimientos europa se ha puesto en primera l nea desde el inicio de las hostilidades para resolver este nuevo conflicto en suelo europeo as pues yo sigo convencido de que la primera misi n de europa es proteger a los europeos es precisamente lo que hemos hecho al poner todos los medios para reducir este nuevo conflicto cuyas consecuencias podr an ser catastr ficas si se revelara como heraldo de una nueva guerra fr a
5234635 al negociar en nombre de la ue un alto el fuego con el presidente ruso dmitri medvedev el primer ministro vladimir putin y el presidente georgiano mikheil saakachvili nicolas sarkozy esperaba poner de manifiesto que europa podr a gestionar un conflicto de gran importancia sarkozy que ejerce la presidencia semestral de la ue demostr un activismo in dito en europa ha recogido los frutos de su trabajo de reconciliaci n con los pa ses de la ampliaci n los m s hostiles frente a mosc desde hace un a o el presidente franc s cuida muy bien de estos pa ses que se hab an sentido humillados por jacques chirac
5234636 durante sus visitas a rusia y georgia angela merkel ha aprovechado el margen de maniobra que ten a y lo ha hecho de la mejor manera posible a diferencia de las numerosas declaraciones de los ltimos su mensaje ha sido relativamente claro rusia se ha pasado y georgia sigue siendo un estado soberano
5234637 la canciller no se ha dejado tentar para hablar de una nueva edad de hielo entre este y oeste la congelaci n del di logo entre la ue y rusia o entre la otan y rusia no solamente perjudicar a al gobierno medvedev sino que dejar a a occidente sin importantes posibilidades de influencia pues a pesar de los alardes de mosc en estos d as se ha podido ver que la dura reacci n internacional s ha impresionado al lado ruso y ha acelerado la retirada de las tropas
5234638 dmitri medvedev y ngela merkel buscan respuestas a las preguntas de qui n es el culpable y de qu hacer
5234639 el presidente dmitri medvedev tras esperar a que todas las partes incluido el l der georgiano estamparan la firma en los seis principios de regulaci n de los conflictos de osetia del sur y abjasia dise ados conjuntamente por rusia y francia garantiz personalmente la fidelidad de mosc a este documento hoy 18 de agosto rusia comenzar a sacar su contingente militar hacia las posiciones que ocupaban antes del conflicto el papel de sarkozy ha consistido en que el conflicto dejara de ser b lico por lo que respecta a merkel ha demostrado que para europa hay otros puntos fundamentales y no se trata s lo de la integridad territorial de georgia merkel dio a entender que no le interesa en absoluto la respuesta a la pregunta de qui n ha sido el culpable al kremlin no le gusta que occidente haya tomado a mosc como responsable del conflicto en osetia del sur y que al mismo tiempo cierre los ojos ante las acciones de tbilisi
5234640 el kremlin tendr que aguantar a saakashvili como m nimo hasta oto o
5234641 la canciller de la rfa angela merkel y la secretaria de estado de los ee uu condoleeza rice hicieron visitas simult neas a rusia y georgia respectivamente en nombre de la uni n europea y ee uu convencieron a dmitri medvedev y mijail saakashvili para que aceptasen el plan sarkozy de regulaci n en osetia del sur y abjasia para saakashvili la visita de la secretaria de estado estadounidense es la garant a de su seguridad personal para medvedev la visita de merkel es la se al de que las relaciones con occidente no se congelar n al parecer occidente est dispuesto a hacer todo lo posible para preservar el r gimen de saakashvili al tiempo que rusia sencillamente no dispone de instrumentos para sustituir al presidente de georgia
5234642 rusia dice que hoy empieza a retirar sus tropas de georgia
5234643 el presidente ruso dmitri medvedev prometi ayer que rusia empezar a a retirarse hoy de georgia la presi n internacional para la retirada aument con las duras declaraciones de ee uu y de alemania y ante la petici n de georgia de que hubiera observadores internacionales que confirmasen la retirada de las fuerzas rusas que ayer a n estaban en gori
5234644 durante muchos a os ee uu ha incrementado sus esfuerzos para situar a georgia en el rea de influencia occidental sin embargo los rusos no han dudado en actuar con virulencia contra este pa s de esta manera rusia confirma su recuperaci n como gran potencia capaz de actuar en la escena internacional a partir de ahora bruselas berl n par s y londres tambi n tendr n que tener en cuenta a mosc europa se muestra dividida y las disensiones en el seno de la otan siguen creciendo sobre todo los pa ses de la antigua zona de influencia sovi tica como letonia estonia y lituania abogan por actuar con m s contundencia y por conceder apoyo incluso militar a georgia pero el resto de europa se muestra muy consciente de que tendremos que seguir viviendo con rusia un asociado que desde hace unos diez d as parece haber cobrado vida nueva y recuperado la confianza por mucho que la otan intente negarlo vladimir putin acaba de congelar las candidaturas de georgia y ucrania
5234645 reevaluaci n de los v nculos de estados unidos con rusia
5234646 la descarada invasi n de georgia por rusia ha suscitado una serie de cuestiones inquietantes que los estadounidenses y muchos otros alrededor del mundo confiaban que estuvieran ya solucionadas es rusia una amenaza para sus vecinos para europa para estados unidos qu est n dispuestos a hacer estados unidos y sus aliados de la otan si rusia hace chantaje o ataca otra naci n democr tica soberana que no es miembro de la alianza deber a occidente seguir buscando el compromiso de rusia o deber a centrarse m s en contener sus ambiciones
5234647 las econom as europeas est n padeciendo m s que la estadounidense
5234648 se puede perdonar a los europeos por sentirse magullados la quiebra inmobiliaria en el otro lado del atl ntico fue lo que desencaden las constricciones crediticias as que la justicia exig a que fuese estados unidos quien m s padeciese el hundimiento pero ee uu no ha seguido el gui n y est capeando la tormenta mejor de lo que se esperaba europa brega por no hundirse las cifras publicadas el jueves 14 de agosto mostraban que la econom a de la zona del euro se encogi a una tasa anualizada del 0 8 en el segundo trimestre la primera reversi n de ese tipo desde 2001 tampoco parece que las cosas vayan a mejorar en breve
5234649 la econom a europea empieza a mostrar los primeros s ntomas de agotamiento desde la introducci n del euro en 1999 la desaceleraci n registrada a nivel mundial y la subida de los precios energ ticos y alimentarios est n mermando las prestaciones econ micas de la zona euro la comisi n europea no descarta una posible recesi n las causas son evidentes las empresas reducen sus inversiones y las familias gastan menos debido a la p rdida de poder adquisitivo como consecuencia del incremento del precio del crudo y de los alimentos en este ltimo trimestre las principales econom as europeas alemania francia e italia se encuentran en recesi n mientras que espa a y holanda consiguen a duras penas evitar un crecimiento negativo el actual panorama no hace presagiar una importante recuperaci n en el tercer trimestre
5234650 todav a no es una recesi n se necesitar an dos trimestres de disminuci n del pib pero los economistas se refieren a la coyuntura econ mica con una serie de preocupantes calificativos clara ralentizaci n crisis financiera o crecimiento ahogado el equipo sarkozy va a adentrarse en un dif cil periodo la coyuntura es mala y las reformas estructurales constantemente anunciadas s lo tendr n resultados si los tienen con un desfase de al menos dos a os mientras tanto el estado de las finanzas p blicas proh be nuevos regalos fiscales las exportaciones est n en mala situaci n el consumo tambi n y las inversiones son poco din micas es decir los tres motores del crecimiento funcionan de forma muy lenta es hora de dejar los discursos tranquilizadores y de decir la verdad a los franceses sobre la recesi n que se acerca lo pueden o r est n preparados para ello
5234651 elecci n estrat gica para la pol tica energ tica estadounidense
5234652 las ltimas semanas la pol tica energ tica ha ocupado el centro de la contienda por la presidencia de estados unidos lamentablemente la forma de la que este tema ha empezado a destacar hace que se tengan pocas esperanzas de que el pr ximo presidente lo vaya a hacer bien el problema es que el cambio clim tico la estabilidad econ mica y la geopol tica no son los factores que han dado relevancia a la energ a quien lo ha hecho es el precio de la gasolina ambos candidatos especialmente mccain han enfocado el precio del petr leo como un problema que necesita resolverse la pr xima administraci n se enfrentar a una elecci n estrat gica en lo que se refiere a la lucha contra el cambio clim tico y la diversificaci n del suministro energ tico

5234680 these are the final efforts being made by the icc to convince the teams who are not happy with the security situation in pakistan that everything is in order in pakistan
5234681 it is a dicey situation for the icc as some countries are citing advice from their foreign offices not to travel to pakistan at this stage due to increasing threats from taliban in this scenario there is nothing much the icc can do to force them to change their minds

5234689 im a great admirer of film so i dont see this as an either or question ridley scott is a friend of mine and i enormously admire his work i do think film at its best is fully the equal of a great novel blade runner for example is a film that would stand up against most contemporary novels i do think that the great gift literature has is its intimacy it takes place in a readers mind whereas a movie takes place on a screen and you watch it but a novel is played out in your imagination and interacts with the imagination the reason for the durability of the form is that private conversation between the imagination of the writers and the imaginations of the reader people have always found that attractive and i suspect always will the great gift of literature is that it takes you into worlds that are not your world and makes it feel like your world i read the literature of the united states before i ever came to america and when i came here i felt like i knew something about the country from reading faulkner and steinbeck up to contemporary writers so whether its taking us into the past or into another country we can gain the world through literature and i think that is a unique gift of the form

5234751 when you get to the semi final it is puck of the ball stuff exactly what it was today sunday
5234752 it is true to say that we have had interest and some good offers from teams in other championships but formula 1 is what we are concentrating on
5234753 its where takuma deserves to be and naturally we are talking to a number of people about 2009
5234754 the real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes
5234755 volgens mij heb je met een geslaagde eerste poging op 5m65 al heel veel kans op een plaats in de finale
5234756 voor mij is het goed dat er niet op 5m70 wordt gesprongen en wel op 5m65 en 5m75 die 5m65 heb ik deze zomer al een paar keer overschreden en ik ben ook naar hier gekomen om het belgisch record alleen op mijn naam te zetten dan kan ik dat proberen op 5m75
5234757 naast een belgisch record is het mijn doel dus om in de finale te geraken
5234758 en eens ik in de finale zit wil ik daar mijn plaats zo goed mogelijk verdedigen dat zou een beloning zijn voor al mijn werk en nog eens de bevestiging dat ik 8 jaar geleden de goede keuze heb gemaakt door te gaan voor het polsstokspringen en niet voor de sprint mijn techniek begint de laatste tijd te komen nu moet ik in de wedstrijd de snelheid er kunnen insteken en de laatste passen goed krijgen
5234759 onze spelers konden nauwelijks eten en zijn dan maar snel weer vertrokken
5234760 kobe is een goeie vriend en een speler waarvan ik hou
5234761 ze ziet er beter uit dan ooit ik ben zo trots ik hou zoveel van haar
5234762 op de korte termijn verwachten we dat de prijzen hoog blijven
5234763 hij had een slechte start strekte al ruim voor de finish zijn armen en loopt dan nog zon ongelooflijke tijd ik vond het echt angstaanjagend om te zien
5234764 bolt loopt harder dan alle mannen die de afgelopen jaren zijn gepakt op doping ik wil absoluut niet iedere goede prestatie meteen verdacht maken maar deze tijd van bolt schiet eruit ik hoop dat de dopingcontroles goed genoeg zijn anders zitten we straks met een tweede balco zaak in onze maag
5234765 inflation or more precisely peoples perceptions that prices are rising much faster is likely to cast its shadow over economies and markets for some time to come
5234766 yet uk equity investors can not only protect themselves from higher prices but also seek to profit from them
5234767 we are a nation of animal lovers and many of us regard our pet as part of the family im not surprised that
5234768 veterinary healthcare has made great strides in the last few years offering highly sophisticated treatment for a huge range of animal ailments pet insurance helps owners choose the best treatment for their pets without worrying about costs
5234769 capitano ma ce stemo a si o no tutti quanti allarrembaggio
5234770 capitano il sole sorto ormai io mi ammutino mi a mmu ti no
5234771 dopo tanto tempo e una sbornia favolosa torno a scrivere i miei traguardi ambiziosi
5234772 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5234773 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5234774 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5234775 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5234776 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5234777 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5234778 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5234779 i will remain faithful to the nation and my countrymen and promise in the name of the people that i will remain faithful to the sovereign nation of nepal
5234780 we believe we have clamped down on the syndicates and are now dealing with a network of criminals who feed into each other
5234781 initially we also saw hijackers targeting motorists in their driveways and at robots but now they seem to be attempting to hijack people anywhere
5234782 it is a smooth co ordinated and better approach to crime and does not allow for fragmentation so it should yield better results
5234783 the police station where the hijacking occurs has 20 minutes in which to contact the war room
5234784 if we do make an arrest we can use the information gathered from several stations to oppose bail whereas before with the stations working independently bail wasnt opposed because we didnt know that the suspect was involved or linked to other crimes
5234785 the shot heard round the world at lexington and concord
5234786 government agencies should pause and reflect on the significance of this verdict
5234787 peter bernhard and don kula were outstanding in helping present this case to a jury this was a team effort
5234788 its clear the jury got it and thats what is so gratifying to the team the jury understood that no matter how big an agency people have rights and those rights can be protected
5234789 the coordinated efforts of mr hyatt and his legal and accounting team were critical in achieving this significant and historical result
5234790 hoped this will prevent other taxpayers from going through the same nightmare i have had to endure for over a decade
5234791 we came to this competition with resolve so we wanted to show our liveliness
5234792 we were really concentrated while swimming today seeing the japanese spectators holding the japanese flag helped us
5234793 the second quarter of the year is typically our strongest quarter for sales of plant and animal nutrient products and this years second quarter had exceptionally good results with both revenue and earnings more than doubling from the prior year period
5234794 we attribute this to the very strong benefits our customers are able to gain from the use of our technologically advanced products and the rapid expansion of our distribution network to cover new geographic regions and build strong brand recognition for our products
5234795 as food production in china continues to increase we believe demand will continue to increase for our plant and animal nutrients we plan to sustain our business growth by expanding our distribution and sales network and broadening our geographic market coverage we also plan to provide more technical assistance to our customers and help them achieve the best possible consistent results by using our products
5234796 americas future conversations about politics and policy during the 2008 republican national convention
5234797 charitable giving is an important part of telefloras philosophy and we are proud to align ourselves with an organization that is working with the top experts in cancer research and forging a new way to develop breakthroughs that will put an end to all kinds of cancer
5234798 by bringing together the best and brightest scientific minds in cancer research and investing in their projects su2c is taking the bureaucratic obstacles out of the way through the gift of flowers we can be part of the movement to help push cancer innovation forward
5234799 cancer claims one person every minute of every day in the united states every year in this country it takes the lives of more than half a million people worldwide cancer kills more than six million people annually
5234800 we want everyone to know that they can make a difference in this fight and i want to thank teleflora for providing another avenue for people to do so
5234801 it was interesting and rather disturbing to see that the south african swim captain was apparently celebrating the fact that i did not win a medal in the event
5234802 an athlete from another country who sat next to gerhard came to me afterwards and told me how shocked he was to see gerhard openly celebrate the result with a big smile on his face what can i say to that but captain my captain i hope its not the typical south african reaction
5234803 as the captain of the south african swimming squad the team feels that the direction in which recent activities are going is not in favour of the national team and national squad
5234804 all the performance athletes had to sign a code of conduct in which we are bound by certain criteria the cut off date by which the contract had to be signed was may 18 2007 the four male swimmers lyndon ferns neethling schoeman and darian townsend would like to have the rules bent so they can benefit without being a part of the team they do not see themselves part of the team in this situation anyway
5234805 unfortunately south africa didnt win a medal although almost everybody broke sa and african records
5234806 it was a young team with lots of talent but the mentality within swimming in south africa has to change in order for the swimmers and coaches to reach their full potential
5234807 this latest release is the result of close collaboration with customers who have experienced first hand the pain of losing confidential client data or intellectual property through email

5234814 during our evaluation of pick your part we were very impressed by its operations and employees and are excited to have this opportunity to add them to lkq corporations business
5234815 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistamines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion antihistamines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day
5234816 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the next day when least expected
5234817 i dont think im as effective if i change the way i play because i wont put myself around and get in peoples faces and annoy people if you like
5234818 to be honest i had that problem with darlington last season and i did go off the ball but im not going to change the way i play ive always been a physical player and the manager brought me up here so you cant really change the player you brought in
5234819 ive never been intimidated my dad would give me a slap around the face if i ever did become intimidated ive been brought up that way and i wont shy away in a game and if i do annoy people along the way then so be it
5234820 it was a bit of handbags to be honest as far as im concerned it was a nothing thing we shook hands after the game and thats it
5234821 obviously celtic and rangers make it a more attractive league
5234822 those are the games you want to play in and thats up to the manager if he plays me or not
5234823 ive heard thats the big one thats the big rivalry i do like playing in derbies and that will be a nice feeling
5234824 we are delighted to have secured the services of harry and terry you couldnt pick two better english managers to comment on the national side to have their valued insight and opinions for these crucial england games is a real coup for setanta and completes a first class presenting line up which im sure viewers will enjoy

5234828 you cant go through what he went through and not have a willpower of at least 18
5234829 its very uncommon for humans but mccain could even have developed an even higher willpower than that
5234830 one of our supporters witnessed a mccain staffer carrying several horns into the green room
5234831 when obama entered the room a short time later the horns were gone
5234832 if mccain wants to find out whats on someones mind he uses an ax

5234851 there are some times i still want to hit before i retire thats whats keeping me going and i want to try some new events
5234852 whether its the backstroke or the 100 metres free there are some other things bob bowman his coach and i are going to try out and work on over the next four years it will definitely be fun a change and be interesting

5234858 may this festival heralding the new year bring happiness and prosperity to all and strengthen our commitment to harmony and universal brotherhood
5234859 it is fallacious to argue that mobile vehicles deployed for the sole purpose of advertisements can be equated with public utility and intermediate public transport vehicles
5234860 the jmm is holding a crucial meeting of all party mlas and mps to chalk out the next plan of action we are making exercises to form the next government the situation would be clear in a day or two
5234861 all those who are with koda will fall in line and support us ultimately we are going to form the government
5234862 if soren is insisting upon making way for the president rule in the state we are ready for it
5234863 emergency services and outpatients department are badly hit because of the agitation
5234864 we reject this election as the ruling party did not take opposition into confidence on the speaker election
5234865 kishore mohanty is the only candidate for the speakers post
5234866 i will uphold the dignity of the post and work in coordination with all parties
5234867 the biggest hurdle in the way of democracy has been removed
5234868 its a realistic decision in view of the way things were unfolding
5234869 i am sure they would assess the speech the consequences and repercussions and they would also keep in mind the political developments in the country and reach a decision
5234870 the innate nature of the it and ites industry is such that the size of the pie is a growing one while north america has got widely exposed to it the same is not true of other regions of the world such as europe japan and apac there is an increasing awareness that one has to stick to the core activities and hive off the non core ones to players who specialise in those activities the other advantage in the process is that what is non core to a company is core to the service provider and hence there is a lot of scope for value addition in the performance of the non core activities
5234871 beetle will come here after strengthening our dealership network it will come next year

5234873 in the interest of the country i have decided to resign the resignation will reach the national assembly speaker shortly
5234874 now they want to impeach me are they afraid of my constitutional powers impeachment and chargesheet is parliaments right to give a reply is my right
5234875 no chargesheet can stand against me no charge can be proved against me i have this much confident in myself because i have not done anything for myself whatever i have done i have done for pakistan its people whatever the chargesheet i have no fear
5234876 but questions arise as to what impact the impeachment will have on the country whether the country will descend into further instability and confrontation whether the office of presidency should come under pressure should it come under impeachment procedure
5234877 the dignity of the office of the president will be affected the countrys dignity will be maintained
5234878 i dont want to put my friends supporters in problem
5234879 keeping all this in view and taking into account all the factors and in consultation with legal experts supporters and close aides and on their advise and in the interest of the country i have decided to resign
5234880 i dont need anything for me i put my future in the hands of the people
5234881 i too am human and could have made some mistakes i hope these will be pardoned because by intentions were clear
5234882 they may damage me but they are damaging the countrys interests
5234883 at the personal and constitutional level no vendetta was practiced by me
5234884 unfortunately all my efforts to promote reconciliation my pleas to forget the past and look to the future have failed

5234904 rick did an amazing job of asking the questions most of us would ask the candidates if we could
5234905 i just really liked how john mccain gave well stated answers he didnt even have to think he takes a stand barack has a charming personality he didnt always give the direct answer
5234906 i think obama did very well and he doesnt need to win a majority of this audience he merely needs to keep mccains support below typical trends but this was mccains best performance in memory for the first time i can think of in 08 at least he comes across as the kind of guy a lot of conservatives can want to vote for rather than merely settle for
5234907 but i also think that its worth noting that but i suspect he may be riding high for a while after tonight
5234908 obama wasnt just bad but that mccain was very good
5234909 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5234910 is an enumerated power granted to congress under article 1 section 8 of the constitution it is not it is a general statement describing the section content and justifying the need to levy taxes

5234930 known as a scan moir the problem is a wavy pattern caused by the shadow mask pattern and the horizontal line pattern
5234931 policing drops traffic whereas shaping buffers it for sending later
5234932 enough tokens enter the bucket at regular intervals to allow the interface to send the number of bytes configured for that interval
5234933 at each tail drop each session goes into slow start and then ramps up its sending rate when the interface queue fills all packets are dropped again and all sessions reduce their sending again eventually this results in waves of increased and decreased transmission causing underutilisation of the interface
5234934 when large flows with increased window sizes fill the interface queue packets from smaller or less aggressive flows are then dropped
5234935 an evolutionary vision of a network that integrates network and application functionality cooperatively and allows the network to be smart about how it handles traffic to minimise the footprint of applications
5234936 hitherto wealth was acquired by breaking laws or at least bending them to ones convenience software was the first instance where wealth was created honestly and legally and more important visibly so
5234937 the software industry led the fight for regulatory reforms in areas such as liberalising access to the stock market and listing requirements it also led the way in corporate governance with their emphasis on transparency and ethical management
5234938 for example the ten year deal between accenture and dabur for management of daburs it needs the bank of india hp deal for branch office computerisation 750 million bharti ibm deal and both the mega reliance infocomm telecom network and the reliance retail petrol pump projects with ibm are clear indicators of what can happen in the indian landscape

5234949 when they evacuate the islands is when we start packing up and basically pull in all the lawn furniture all the plastic chairs and tables
5234950 well probably go pick up some water and flashlights everything everybody else does but other than that i think well be fine
5234951 i have never been one to believe you can have a true deflation with a fiat currency
5234952 i have never been one to believe that you will get a true deflation with a fiat currency if for no other reason than there is no reason to believe that a corrupt government long accustomed to gorging itself with massive deficit spending and obliging various corruptions both in and out of government all made possible by a fiat currency that has produced inflation in the prices of so so many things in a series of bubbles is going to one day slap itself on the forehead and say whoa
5234953 inflation ends when the central bank is no longer able or willing to extend credit and or when consumers and businesses are no longer willing to borrow because further expansion and or speculation no longer makes any economic sense
5234954 if there were a run on the dollar in the foreign exchange market price inflation could spike up and the fed would have no choice but to raise interest rates aggressively
5234955 says who you hell interest rates are already less than half the rate of inflation because the fed and other central banks are pouring so much money into the markets and with a fiat currency and a demonstrated willingness on the part of congress and every other government on the face of the planet to abide every possible corruption in a desperate clutching at straws attempt to forestall the inevitable collapse of the global bubble they can spend and spend and spend and it will never end until it collapses in a big stinking heap bsh
5234956 the aggressive russian force beyond south ossetian borders has been something that really shocked many people the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of the georgian port of poti is a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
5234957 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of any possible conflict
5234958 any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
5234959 poland in deploying the us system opens itself to a nuclear strike that is 10
5234960 if the eu wants to play a role in reaching peace it needs open channels of dialogue to tbilisi and to moscow
5234961 calls from some eu member states particularly those in eastern europe to deal harshly with moscow by scrapping talks with russia on a new strategic partnership have put germany in a tricky position germany is heavily dependent on russian energy and remains an advocate of closer european ties with moscow
5234962 look into the future and take a role in further stabilization
5234963 by bringing additional pro american oriented countries into the nato alliance
5234964 china and russia are forging ahead with the partnership of strategic cooperation toward their established goals and the development of both countries is faced with opportunities and challenges at the same time
5234965 elevate the practical cooperation with china to a new height
5234966 grave concern over the escalation of tension and armed conflicts

5234968 crowd was persuaded to disperse and leave and no extreme actions took place

5234970 the russians are alcohol sodden barbarians but now and then they vomit up a genius the empire of the czars hasnt produced such a frightening genius since joseph stalin
5234971 the new reality is that a nuclear cash rich and energy blessed russia doesnt really worry too much whether its long term future is bleak given problems with muslim minorities poor life expectancy rates and a declining population instead in the here and now it has a window of opportunity to reclaim prestige and weaken its adversaries
5234972 you know that our countrys population is declining by an average of almost 700 000 people a year we have raised this issue on many occasions but have for the most part done very little to address it first we need to lower the death rate second we need an effective migration policy and third we need to increase the birth rate
5234973 vialogys prior technical expertise in electromagnetic subsurface imaging and sensor fusion and especially ground penetrating sar is key to our ability to market and offer a differentiated well priced service to our pipeline customers to date the pipeline industry has been unsuccessful in exploiting cost benefits of aerial sensing due to sensor signal processing and performance limitations
5234974 these pilot surveys will include geolocation and health assessments for over 200km of pipeline segments
5234975 this is an excellent market opportunity for our qsub tm subsurface imaging platform powered by our patented signal processing technology qri tm the ability to provide guaranteed location information in a cost effective manner should provide the firms near term access to a large addressable market which has been valued in excess of 2bn we are very pleased with astfs success in acquiring potential customers and strategic partners in the pipeline industry at this early stage

5234979 cambodia definitely had one of the most advanced music scenes in asia at the time
5234980 it is amazing that a lot of it survived at all
5234981 the khmer rouge destroyed everything related to the music scene they could get their hands on including trashing all the recording studios and destroying all the musical recordings they could find
5234982 when i first heard this music i did not think much of it
5234983 the more i listened the more i realized just how different and edgy this music was
5234984 thailand vietnam and laos did not have this scene it was unique to cambodia
5234985 this exposed cambodian musicians to jimi hendrix phil spector the doors
5234986 meanwhile from europe we got latin styles such as cha cha rumba and flamenco
5234987 in the khmer community in long beach california you cannot go down the street without hearing this music
5234988 for them it was about memories of cambodia in the good times
5234989 i remember seeing the tapes of artists like sisamouth and sereysothea for sale in the phnom penh in the 1990s
5234990 i did not really pay any attention to the music until i bought a computer to learn design i stumbled on music editing software and started messing around with sampling khmer music
5234991 soon i was started going out and combing the markets listening to every song i could find from this period and i started to mix and sample them
5234992 the first reaction i had from people was shock they thought it was blasphemy and did not understand why i wanted to do it
5234993 i started remixing old music for fun but now it has become a real mission trying to remind people now just how creative people were back then
5234994 but more often concern about his emerging overconfidence which is making it difficult to interact with him
5234995 you get a sense they are concerned that the al maliki regime has an inflated sense of his power
5234996 he is successfully fashioning himself as an iraqi hero who kicked the americans out that makes him difficult to negotiate with
5234997 theres even some evidence that maliki wants to start a fight with the sons of iraq
5234998 al maliki doesnt believe he has to accommodate these people he will only do it if we twist his arm to the breaking point
5234999 if the negotiations crash and burn i will be forced to pull out all us troops by january 1

5235058 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5235059 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices

5235125 one night i heard her rustling around in her room and i looked in on her the lights were out but there she was trying to tuck her book under the covers
5235126 it never occurred to me that my child can read in the dark

5235130 although knife crime does remain low in the county we are not complacent and take this issue very seriously
5235131 i built my own equipment knew code and had talked with people around the world
5235132 my father was in a position with his work that gave him access to materials i could work on my radios with
5235133 i ended up not being too happy with my life there and got out of the business and soon decided to enlist
5235134 it was just a skeleton group and had no previsions for basic training
5235135 i said no because i couldnt picture myself doing that and told him i would prefer an overseas assignment
5235136 we were off the coast of canada and guarded the entrance to a harbor where a big naval base was
5235137 we could detect a metal drum floating in the ocean 15 miles away
5235138 wed go down the coast and light a fire and then someone would come pick us up and take us to the village
5235139 all it took was a carton of cigarettes they the people in the village were very hospitable
5235140 it was the saddest day of my life when the group departed
5235141 one person had to stay and watch over the equipment that was left and that was me i watched them depart and then i was all alone i had been with basically the same group for two plus years
5235142 i got married when i was in the service but then i got shipped out and it didnt last
5235143 when i came back we ended up getting married again and having two children
5235144 one time i contacted saudi arabia and talked to a captain whose wife was in florida
5235145 i phone patched them so she could talk to him and she ended up sending me a big basket of fruit
5235146 as an amateur radio operator ive seen a lot of changes in technology
5235147 i built big bulky equipment and now people talk with these little cell phones
5235148 on april 28 i was informed by superintendent jack porter of northern local school district that they intended to file a resolution to annex to the muskingum valley educational service center no reasons were given they were complimentary of my work and our staffs work they just felt that they would fit in better as a growing school district with the districts of muskingum county
5235149 were looking to transfer to the muskingum valley esc basically we think they offer a lot more service and weve worked with them off and on for several years
5235150 we serve many school districts outside our three county member area we offer educational opportunities to approximately 18 states plus canada and approximately 78 districts in ohio were flattered that northern would consider being a part of our service offerings
5235151 my guess is it will be 2011 some time prior to that we would be notified well either be approved for this or we will not a lot of this talk is premature
5235152 every esc is different some of their muskingum valley esc charges are better their service overall for what we think down the road will better serve our needs if this happens
5235153 wed like to know the direction as soon as possible so we can start planning were dealing with a lot of jobs here and we have a lot of great people working for us
5235154 lets just say that my previous employment didnt require it o
5235155 in some respects we started searching the day we learned the grunion had not been heard from and was missing
5235156 he was always at sea so i dont know if i ever believed he wasnt coming home as a kid i remember shooting baskets in the driveway i thought if i could get five in a row hed come home
5235157 i had to live with my ex husband there was no other alternative the council said they could give him a one bedroom flat and i could keep the house but two of the children wanted to stay with him so he would need a bigger place anyway
5235158 copeland council decided to help me in june i tried to get private rented accommodation but no one would touch me because i am on benefits i am halfway through my second year of a hairdressing course
5235159 i am terrified about the operation but the main thing for me is having nowhere to go and that me and my children could potentially be homeless
5235160 on august 13 amanda farringtons temporary accommodation was extended indefinitely until a decision is made on her application
5235161 with our massively polluted rivers all producers will have a hard time producing clean fruit and vegetables
5235162 belligerent measures taken by a nation to prevent passage of vessels or aircraft to and from another country customary international law recognizes blockades as an act of war because of the belligerent use of force even against third party nations in enforcing the blockade blockades as acts of war have been recognized as such in the declaration of paris of 1856 and the declaration of london of 1909 that delineate the international rules of warfare
5235163 as part of general international law and customary international law
5235164 the seizure of a french vessel is an act of hostility or reprisal requiring congressional approval the court held that congress pursuant to constitutional war powers had authorized hostilities on the high seas under certain circumstances
5235165 even an order from the president could not justify or excuse an act that violated the laws and customs of warfare chief justice john marshall wrote that a captain of a united states warship could be held personally liable in trespass for wrongfully seizing a neutral danish ship even though
5235166 the courts position seems consistent with a typical trespass case where defendants are liable even when they have a reasonable good faith but mistaken belief in authority to enter on the plaintiffs land
5235167 a blockade of coastal states that had joined the confederacy at the outset of the civil war the court explicitly ruled that a blockade is an act of war and is legal only if properly authorized under the constitution
5235168 the power of declaring war is the highest sovereign power and is limited to the representative of the full sovereignty of the nation it is limited in the united states to its congress exclusively and the authority of the president to be the commander in chief to take that the law be faithfully executed is to be taken in connection with the exclusive power given to congress to declare war and does not enable the president to do it or to introduce without act of congress war or any of its legal disabilities or liabilities on any citizen of the united states
5235169 vested in a congress of the united states which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives
5235170 to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and welfare of the united states
5235171 make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces
5235172 to declare war grant letters of marque and reprisal and make rules concerning capture on land and water
5235173 fundamental doctrine of the constitution to declare war is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature
5235174 determine the existence of any threat to the peace or act of aggression and if necessary take military or other actions to restore international peace and stability
5235175 right of individual or collective self defense if an armed attack occurs against a member until the security council has taken measures to maintain international peace and security

5235231 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5235232 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5235233 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5235234 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5235235 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5235236 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5235241 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5235242 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5235243 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5235244 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5235245 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5235246 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5235247 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion

5235272 this is a very good resource as long as there is a market for tax exempt bonds
5235273 it started by individuals and companies making capital investments in real estate
5235274 then universally individuals and companies started flipping houses for profit and that created a frenzy of investors and speculators in the market
5235275 individuals and companies were under the assumption that they could borrow more and thats when the competition between lenders really increased
5235276 the underlying belief was that as long as the home appreciated then the buyer could buy out before the rate change
5235277 in actuality the demand was unsustainable inflated and to a certain degree false
5235278 a lot of this appreciation was artificial because of the rate of turnover in the real estate market
5235279 that was absolutely needed because what people generally dont realize is that the government is not obligated to back them
5235280 up until now the main backers of their securities has been foreign investment

5235312 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me and without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas ill never forget that no matter where you are no matter how difficult the circumstances there will always be someone who will pick you up
5235313 it just sounded so fake and so contrived so i did a little research about it
5235314 along with other prisoners he worked in the fields day after day in rain and sun during summer and winter his life appeared to be nothing more than backbreaking labor and slow starvation the intense suffering reduced him to a state of despair on one particular day the hopelessness of his situation became too much for him he saw no reason to continue his struggle no reason to keep on living his life made no difference in the world so he gave up leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners as he waited head down he felt a presence slowly he looked up and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down beside him the man said nothing instead he used a stick to trace in the dirt the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible solzhenitsyn slowly rose to his feet picked up his shovel and went back to work outwardly nothing had changed inside he had received hope

5235452 i got a good start to the race but i dropped down to sixth after a few laps and i was worried that i wouldnt be able to fight back especially after not having much dry time on the bike here
5235453 however my confidence grew as we went on and i was able to catch up with john and pass him for fourth at the halfway point the grip levels dropped off towards the end so there was nothing i could do about shinya other than to continue lapping consistently to the flag

5235487 this country has not been doing well in other areas but indicators from this ministry greatly influence our position in the human development index
5235488 the damage done by obasanjos government is enormous and we need patience because the damages of the last eight years are enormous and cannot be repaired in a few years

5235490 since january this year the telecom network has witnessed steady growth which currently outstrips 1 2 million lines every month which indicates the fact that the growth rate is still not abetted this also shows that nigeria has witnessed economic growth because there is a linkage between acquisition of telecom services and economic improvement
5235491 a population unaware of its rights and unable to understand them is a population exposed to exploitation and injustice
5235492 yhri highly praised instructional materials based on the 30 articles united nations universal declaration of the human rights by raising students awareness of the existence and importance of human rights
5235493 we are happy to assist in the nationwide initiative that will assist sierra leoneans to become innovative pioneer for the implementation of human rights education
5235494 young people are the future of this country and we should learn them about leadership and issues about human rights
5235495 my ministry has allocated money for drugs and medical equipment through local government for all the districts
5235496 we expect that this minister should be more proactive than people before him to the extent that if the government is going to do whatever in respect of planning to increase fuel price they need to engage the stakeholders to look at the feasibility of whatever options they have and also to look at further options that are available because if they continue to go the part that they are going by going round the whole country to continue to recycle the whole old and untenable argument it may lead to some tension in the country that might not be palatable for to the government and the people of nigeria i have to tell you that labour has not changed its position on this issue that is we are seriously opposed to anything or any economic policy that could compound the already worsening poverty level in the country subsidy is a thing that is done all over the world subsidy is done to encourage local technology it is done to reduce the negative impact of inflation on the people in our own case where petroleum product is a major item that is consumed by everybody and in a country like ours where income level is so low if they attempt to remove subsidy entirely it is going to have very serious inflationary effect it is going to affect the standard of living of the nigerian people and also affect the security and the rest of it they should consider that the argument of saying that we are going to spend about n700 billion which they claim is equivalent to government capital project budget is not acceptable anywhere
5235497 in the first place it means that the budget itself is not focused on development it is not focused on new development not focused on capital projects but recurrent spending which is not good for the development of the country
5235498 they should look for other sources of generating income and more prudent utilisation of the one that they have we do not even understand what they are talking about by the time there is increase in crude prices in the international market which is always their argument the nation makes more money and the government is always taking a very insignificant proportion of it to fund this so called subsidy so it is to the benefit of the nation that crude prices are going up the nation is not losing anything at all because of this increase that they are crying that they spent n700 billion if prices come down the nation would spend more on subsidy it is not a crime to subsidise because every economy does it one way or the other if they want to address the issue of subsidy whether total removal or partial they must engage the stakeholders let us even put the argument on the table and compare them to current realities in the country before anybody begins to recycle old and untenable argument all over the place people should look at where we are coming from what led to the emergence of the petroleum support fund psf which is used for the subsidy and the result it has produced
5235499 over the years when obasanjo came in 1999 within a very short period of time we had serious strike action up to the time he left there was still a strike action and threat of strike action which ushered in a new government because of the same old indiscriminate adjustment of petroleum prices and the fact that government seems to have no other idea on how to generate income other than to continue to jack up petroleum prices

5235506 for the gfmd to talk about the rights of migrants is devoid of sincerity and full of hypocrisy

5235522 i take the view for the purposes of the present application that there is evidence that they the ivac representatives have been acting in what is a commercially dubious scheme there has been less candour than one would expect from parties to litigation in the way in which the case has been developed on behalf of the defendants information about ivac has been slow in arriving as indeed has information about the relationship between mr mason and mr lindley and the close connections of the latter at one time at least with ukb i am in no doubt that the condition which requires a claimant seeking a freezing order to establish a risk of a dissipation of the assets is clearly made out on the evidence
5235523 i have written to a number of ips undertaking iva work who are unhappy about approaches made to their clients by the iva council and uk bankruptcy and have invited them to start follow up actions in respect of what i believe are false and defamatory statements in the iva council and uk bankruptcy literature

5235534 if the contractors accept that they can still go ahead with the project then they can go on if not i have to inform mr president about the situation

5235537 hier in de buurt moet een cafeetje zijn waar ik in 1985 nog eens een paar dagen ondergedoken gezeten heb
5235538 dat is een lang verhaal maar het komt er op neer dat ik een paar dagen gevlucht was omdat iemand me lastig bleef vallen terwijl ik even rust nodig had iemand had geregeld dat ik in dat cafeetje een paar dagen kon werken en daar ook kon slapen
5235539 nee dat doen we niet maar ik wil wel even een foto maken

5235545 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5235546 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5235547 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5235548 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

5235551 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5235552 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5235553 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5235554 property is notoriously hard to give away for the purposes of iht planning as it is a single asset that is difficult to give away piecemeal
5235555 however by setting up a suitable trust all the iht can be saved subject to seven years survival and there is no pre owned asset tax as a rent is paid for the use of the asset the rental income stays with the beneficiaries so the cut is effectively wiped out

5235585 drivers across the country can fight rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation tires that are underinflated by just six to seven psi can reduce vehicle fuel economy by as much as 2 percent and tire tread wear can also be reduced by as much as ten percent
5235586 tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas are wasted annually by u s drivers simply because theyre driving on underinflated tires
5235587 in addition that same 2 8 billion gallons wasted result into 56 billion pounds of carbon dioxide released into the environment
5235588 we can all help prevent this by making sure our tires are properly inflated
5235589 people can find the tires proper inflation level on the vehicle placard located in the driver side door jamb in the glove box or in the owners manual

5235616 we have been playing really well this competition we played well in patches today but we let them score first which was pretty frustrating they took the first chance and we were only able to unlock them at the end you do not get easy games at the olympics
5235617 hosting horrorshow has been great fun and ive really enjoyed working with all concerned with a style reminiscent of horror films of the 70s and 80s each of the short films tells a story of terror in its own unique way and made with skill and great affection for the genre horrorshow presents five excellent short horror films made by five talented film makers and im very pleased and honored to be associated with them

5235635 crossfit reading offers a unique strength and conditioning program based on functional movement performed at high intensity
5235636 we focus on squats thrusts push ups and sit ups and incorporate things like sandbags gymnastic rings tyres and kettlebells
5235637 we dont use weight machines and our programs are not sport specific
5235638 the aim is to strengthen the whole body so it applies to men and women of all ages and abilities
5235639 i currently run four classes a week at different sites across reading but im about to increase that to five
5235640 i have been involved in personal training for many years but like many i got bored with working out in the gym
5235641 i stumbled across crossfit which was introduced in america in the 1970s and is slowly becoming more and more popular
5235642 i applied to be a franchisee did the relevant qualification and set up crossfit reading in february this year
5235643 i have a huge mix of people students firemen cops mothers rugby players skiers office workers triathletes and so on
5235644 the routines are designed for universal scalability which means that everyone can do the same workout regardless of experience
5235645 for instance weve got an elderly lady and a cage fighter who come to the same session we scale load and intensity we dont change programs
5235646 absolutely every single one of our sessions is different which means you get that variety that you dont get with a monotonous gym program
5235647 you will also learn new exercises and lifts and all your results are recorded so you can gauge your progress
5235648 unlike the commercial gyms which can be intimidating at crossfit everyone eggs each other on and we all get together afterwards there are no bad vibes or egos
5235649 yes in the sense that we go back to basics instead of weight machines we use basic movement patterns because they are more relevant in everyday life
5235650 the beauty of crossfit is that you can do it on a budget
5235651 i often tell my guys to do workouts in their gardens at home
5235652 people need to realise that joining an expensive gym and having all the fancy kit isnt necessarily the right way to train
5235653 i saw great potential here reading is a good hy did you hub for fitness and home to lots of big commercial gyms yet nowhere does what i do
5235654 great ive gone from 22 members to 44 in just three months
5235655 a lot of my members had become stagnant in the gym and they love the fact that we do things differently whether it be lifting a sandbag or swinging a sledgehammer
5235656 ive got rugby players who have given up the gym entirely and now just come to my workouts
5235657 i think its being able to apply my methodology and witnessing people reaping the benefits of the routines and achieving their goals
5235658 im hoping to find my oen place later this year
5235659 im also in discussions with the british weight lifting association about helping their youngsters come through the ranks

5235689 why do they keep voting in these bozos into congress
5235690 we achieved both press freedom and a jailed whopper of a fish but now we have perhaps more corruption than ever before what gives any theories

5235704 environment secretary joselito atienza yesterday defended the administrations policy on population and supported the churchs strong advocacy in promoting a culture of life among filipinos
5235705 but other administration allies took a more aggressive stance and slammed the church for blocking a proposal in congress to enact a bill promoting the use of contraceptives
5235706 how can we build our own railroads we cant even produce our own tanks and armored vehicles for our military we had iron mines but never had a world class steel mill
5235707 real decisions are made in the palace and that the civil service commission isnt particularly capable of enforcing anything and certainly not in influencing the quality or lack thereof of executive appointments
5235708 and its high time for the philippine catholic church to endorse artificial birth control methods
5235709 meanwhile the north luzon railways corp nlrc has been paying an average of 400 000 p17 118 million monthly in interest payments since january 2005 although the chinese contractor has yet to build the modern caloocan to malolos railroad
5235710 she may not have gotten categorical support for the things she might do in case her unpopular administration is shaken by the wrath of a long suffering people but it is good enough for arroyo that she has given the military the illusion that the us is behind her with that she believes that her presidency whatever questions about its legitimacy is safe
5235711 how effective is the judicial system at prosecuting and punishing individuals for corruption when abuses are uncovered
5235712 bencard you can trace our inability to build our own railroads while korea has its hyundai rotem as mentioned by supremo above with the different road we took from countries like south korea over there they implemented land reform and then focused on home grown industrialization in summary addressing the problem of inequality works from two directions

5235718 you have right to remain silent and i will make sure you use that right
5235719 i recognize this weakness in the bureaucracy like when neri was appointed in the ched and now appointed in the sss
5235720 if you look at the procurement law it is ambiguous ang palausot for the delay section four states that the funding may come from anywhere

5235730 the philippines will be having the worlds most expensive railway about 25 million per kilometer
5235731 he said tibets electric railway system which was harder to build because of the areas mountainous landscape would fail in comparison with the philippines northrail project
5235732 drilon said tibet only spent about 3 7 million per km for the construction of the complicated structure
5235733 one of the things we need to look at in the evaluation of the projects is the best way to deliver them
5235734 the government is taking a long term view they plan out the building of infrastructure over a long period of time they dont do them as a one off it has the effect of creating an industry that specializes in that kind of work
5235735 geologically sound sparsely populated landscape in a developing country might be built for as little as us 2 million per kilometre including electrical and mechanical equipment
5235736 you are 0 on 3 guesses live in phil angry amp unhappy far below an average person of hitting an equal chance
5235737 the chinese contractor has no technical capability to undertake the north rail project it has no expertise or proven track record in turnkey railway projects
5235738 while it claims to be ranked no 37 now ranked no 47 by the global engineering news record in the list of 225 largest international contractors in 2004 the cnmec is also ranked no 14 nowhere to be found on the enrs list of top 60 chinese contractors
5235739 cnmecs full corporate name is china national machinery and equipment import and export corporation a trading company
5235740 the loan also has some strange features a down payment equal to five percent of the contract price due within 30 days upon signing of the loan agreement and advance payment of 25 percent to the chinese contractor within 15 days of contract effectivity
5235741 lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency by a continuing process of inflation governments can confiscate secretly and unobserved an important part of the wealth of their citizens by this method they not only confiscate but they confiscate arbitrarily and while the process impoverishes many it actually enriches some the sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth those to whom the system brings windfalls beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires become profiteers who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie whom the inflationism has impoverished not less than of the proletariat as the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month all permanent relations between debtors and creditors which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless and the process of wealth getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery lenin was certainly right there is no subtler no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency the process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose
5235742 the long run is a misleading guide to current affairs in the long run we are all dead economists set themselves too easy too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is past the ocean is flat again
5235743 the love of money as a possession as distinguished from the love of money as a means to the enjoyments and realities of life will be recognised for what it is a somewhat disgusting morbidity one of those semi criminal semi pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease but beware the time for all this is not yet for at least another hundred years we must pretend to ourselves and to everyone that fair is foul and foul is fair for foul is useful and fair is not avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still for only they can lead us out of the tunnel of economic necessity into daylight

5235747 nationalization has traditionally had a bad name in the united states but it could be an attractive alternative for the american people and our representative government as well turning bankrupt wall street banks into public institutions might allow the government to get out of the debt cyclone by undoing what got us into it instead of robbing peter to pay paul flapping around in a sea of debt trying to stay afloat by creating more debt the government could address the problem at its source it could restore the right to create money to congress the public body to which that solemn duty was delegated under the constitution the most brilliant banking model in our national history was established in the first half of the eighteenth century in benjamin franklins home province of pennsylvania the local government created its own bank which issued money and lent it to farmers at a modest interest the provincial government created enough extra money to cover the interest not created in the original loans spending it into the economy on public services the bank was publicly owned and the bankers it employed were public servants the interest generated on its loans was sufficient to fund the government without taxes and because the newly issued money came back to the government the result was not inflationary 7 the pennsylvania banking scheme was a sensible and highly workable system that was a product of american ingenuity but that never got a chance to prove itself after the colonies became a nation it was an ironic twist since according to benjamin franklin and others restoring the power to create their own currency was a chief reason the colonists fought for independence the bankers money creating machine has had two centuries of empirical testing and has proven to be a failure it is time the sovereign right to create money is taken from a private banking elite and restored to the american people to whom it properly belongs

5235758 no matter how heated and emotional the debates are on proposed population management bills the inevitable finale is that the church will have the last say
5235759 based on past experience in the philippine congress the church has always objected to bills on family planning population management and reproductive health legislators make a hasty retreat and the bills are archived only to be resurrected at some time and the cycle begins
5235760 in essence what you know and where you came from is immaterial if it cannot be seen in your actual work

5235767 mosher foresees that the situation would ultimately lead to the collapse of the public health sector
5235768 the hunger is made worse when the poor cant grow food because most of the millions of hectares of land are left unused by the rich or turned into housing estates to avoid land reform
5235769 blessed are the poor for theirs is the kingdom of heaven

5235815 pakistan lacks any institutional checks that could help maintain oversight over isi operations
5235816 there is evidence implicating the isi in large scale attacks in both afghanistan and india
5235817 isi and pakistan army had been working to send islamist militants into indian kashmir a process that led to short kargil war in the summer of 1999 the same year in which army chief gen pervez musharraf a key figure in pakistans kashmiri islamist militant project came to power in an october coup
5235818 when you think about temporary street races in formula 1 you mainly think about monaco however valencia does not have very much in common with this classic race just that both cities are located on the mediterranean coast and that both circuits lead along the harbour front while the monte carlo race is the slowest of the year with an average speed of about 156km h for the fastest lap and is also the shortest with a race distance of almost 254km we face a race distance of 310km in valencia and a track on which the cars will reach 300km h or more five times per lap three times per lap the drivers also have to brake to about 80km h which will be as extremely demanding for the brakes as the montreal circuit the longest full throttle section will be along the harbour where the drivers will drive at full throttle for 13 seconds the front straight is 185 metres long and the shortest of all formula 1 circuits this year we calculated an average speed per lap of 225km h which will be the eighth fastest of all grand prix tracks this is not typical for a street race it is more like a version of silverstone or monza but located in a city

5235838 and the child francie nolan was of all the rommelys and all the nolans
5235839 i knew i had it in me i knew we had the pace
5235840 people like my teammate who had some problems during the weekend who could not find the pace suddenly get a safety car period and found himself on the podium so that was basically it
5235841 i think going into the race it felt like a big cloud over my mind and it was difficult to stay focused because obviously you had this feeling in the team the team werent getting any points so you didnt know whether the team hated you or just hated the situation or who they blamed
5235842 following timo glocks incident during the german grand prix at hockenheim toyota motorsport initiated a thorough investigation
5235843 there must be a very good deal involved for someone to explain its longevity given that this is the 23rd year of the hungarian grand prix
5235844 the fia has begun its annual routine random checks on all formula one engines with mercedes benz the first manufacturer whose power unit will be examined
5235845 that process began after hockenheim with lewis hamiltons engine being the first to be sealed by the fia so its checks can be conducted
5235846 but then returned to the press room after it with the weight of the world back on his shoulders and admitted he made a mistake in not allowing fernando through in quali
5235847 we went through what the programme was and they asked me why i didnt do the part they wanted me to
5235848 were both on the front row so we can still smile
5235849 i decided that the claimant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to sexual activities albeit unconventional carried on between consenting adults on private property
5235850 there was bondage beating and domination which seem to be typical of s and m behaviour but there was no public interest or other justification for the clandestine recording for the publication of the resulting information and still photographs or for the placing of the video extracts on the news of the world website all of this on a massive scale of course i accept that such behaviour is viewed by some people with distaste and moral disapproval but in the light of modern rights based jurisprudence that does not provide any justification for the intrusion on the personal privacy of the claimant
5235851 it is perhaps worth adding that there is nothing landmark about this decision
5235852 i am not persuaded that it is right to extend the application of exemplary or punitive damages into this field or to include an additional element specifically directed towards deterrence
5235853 what can be achieved by a monetary award in the circumstances is limited any award must be proportionate and avoid the appearance of arbitrariness i have come to the conclusion that the right award taking all these circumstances into account is 60 000
5235854 this judgment has nailed the nazi lie upon which the news of the world sought to justify their disgraceful intrusion into my private life by law we are all entitled to have our privacy respected
5235855 we could use it as a training exercise as how not to go about it if you want your pension the words fia and orgy are on the front page of every news feed
5235856 our press is less free today after another judgement based on privacy laws emanating from europe
5235857 they should have more knowledge of life than to allow this to continue and that is what is showing up negatively against them
5235858 many would think that if a prominent man puts himself year after year into the hands literally and metaphorically of prostitutes he is gambling in placing so much trust in them
5235859 there is a risk of exposure or blackmail inherent in such a course of conduct to a casual observer it might seem that the claimants behaviour was reckless and almost self destructive
5235860 it could be thought unreasonable to absolve him of all responsibility for placing himself and his family in the predicament in which they now find themselves
5235861 it is part and parcel of human dignity that one must take at least some responsibility for ones own actions
5235862 but the key thing was winning the fia confidence vote because if you are an elected official and your electorate dont want you to continue then you have to stop
5235863 winning the case was good because it stopped all the nonsense about nazism that has now gone and that is the thing that really mattered now as far as doing the job is concerned with the nazi thing out of the way it the controversy will have no affect at all on me
5235864 the truth of the matter is this that no grown up person gives the slightest damn about what other people do in their sex lives
5235865 so as long as it is adults and it is consensual and it is private and as they say you dont frighten the horses then nobody cares the grown ups simply dont care and the people who do care are not worth talking to
5235866 the truth of the matter is this that no grown up person gives the slightest damn about what other people do in their sex lives
5235867 so as long as it is adults and it is consensual and it is private and as they say you dont frighten the horses then nobody cares the grown ups simply dont care and the people who do care are not worth talking to
5235868 mosley should have stood down once revelations wrongly revealed were published
5235869 his form of sexual fantasy does not sit easily in most peoples minds in an individual who is supposed to be setting standards setting an example and conducting business on behalf of others often at government or ministerial level
5235870 but with bernie you have got to be a little bit cautious shall we say
5235871 i still dont know for sure who it was yet and i am not going to blame anybody until i am certain i think it is probably a subject i better draw a veil over
5235872 welcome to the hungaroring for the formula one grand prix ruled over by nazi sex perv in case the race gets boring as it suely will well show you in depth coverage of our leaders sex life
5235873 mosley however was quick to name those f1 personalities who supported him throughout the affair gerhard berger frank williams vijay mallya dietrich mateschitz and ferrari
5235874 in a civilised society we are entitled to expect to be represented by
5235875 others took another course and are far ahead of us now
5235876 two years ago the r26 was a very good car in the corners and on the straights
5235877 did the freeze harm us perhaps yes renault has always had a good engine and this year we realise that we are a little bit behind
5235878 it is always a difficult thing going to the limits of the legalities maybe we have been more legal than the other teams and have lost 20 or 30 horse power for that reason
5235879 the fia confirmed in hungary on thursday that all parts of the engine conformed with the regulations and there was no disparity between the power unit submitted before the season and the one being used now
5235880 as you may know although what the newspaper did is a civil matter in england it is criminal in other countries notably france germany and italy
5235881 a complaint has been made to the relevant public authorities and i anticipate action in the near future in each case it is possible to join a civil complaint to the criminal proceedings and my lawyers intend to do this again any damages recovered will be given to a suitable charity
5235882 once more i should like to say how sorry i am for the annoyance and embarrassment this matter has caused
5235883 i hope that ultimately bringing to justice those responsible will mitigate the effects and above all deter others from such gross invasions of privacy
5235884 so as long as it is adults and it is consensual the paid part or the smacking and it is private edit moderator and as they say you dont frighten the horses horses then nobody cares go on bad bwoy the grown ups bernie amp cvc simply dont care and the people who do care are not worth talking to 100 million amp counting
5235885 heehee lets have fun ferrari next year or the year after that who cares about crashing or not falalalala
5235886 bloody true what you write mate alonso is a great driver but a flawed person what he did last year at mclaren wont be forgotten by any of the f1 teams
5235887 ron dennis told fia about the case during the hungaroring gp after alleging that alonso threatened him to report the team to fia himself if he wasnt given number one status within the mclaren team while alonso declared that false and asked fia to show evidence of his innocence fia then revealed that it had had knowledge of the case thanks to a slip made by coughlan
5235888 but fa did admit to knowlingly receiving confidential information and soliciting it to my mind that is betrayal of the trust that dennis placed in him
5235889 an equal fight between fernando and lewis would be the best thing to happen since the senna mansell prost era
5235890 i was in another team last year and i know how much they improved the engine during the season and how many steps were introduced
5235891 its the same for all the other teams every three or four races there is a little step in the engine that gives you some more horsepower
5235892 for renault it hasnt been like that for the last two years so there is a lack of power probably
5235893 generally speaking when you are leading a grand prix and showing good pace you are more risk averse than those behind you the first stint of the race clearly showed we had an inherent performance advantage over the rest of the field so much so in fact that we felt comfortable about bringing lewis in early for his first pitstop and fuelling him long for his second stint when the safety car was deployed we evaluated the options and felt that keeping lewis out and running low fuel on a clear track outweighed the potential difficulties of pitting him which could have dropped him down the pack and would also have penalised heikki who would have been forced to queue in the pitlane behind lewis we were also affected by a number of contributing factors that we couldnt have foreseen when we made the call firstly the safety car stayed out for longer than we had anticipated which meant the number of laps available for lewis to pull out an advantage was reduced secondly more cars pitted than we expected this meant there was less traffic between lewis and felipe after the safety car came in finally we felt lewis would have an advantage running on low fuel with used tyres in fact the track evolution shifted to give greater benefit to cars fuelled heavily that made his job harder
5235894 if youre a leading team and you get it wrong then youre going to face criticism but hindsight is always 20 20 and we feel we made the right decisions based on the tough choices available to us dont forget too that it was less clear cut for lewis because we had fuelled him longer than the other cars at his first pitstop we had a bigger fuel window than the other teams who were much closer to their second pitstop when the safety car was deployed therefore it was a much easier call for them than it was for us and im sure the decision for ferrari was far more straightforward they probably werent going to beat us and if the tables had been turned wed doubtless have faced criticism if massa had stayed out jumped us and then capitalised on his advantage with a late splash and dash to the finish but lets not forget that nick heidfeld made the strategy work staying out under the safety car and finishing fourth so the strategy remained a valid one
5235895 would also have penalised heikki who would have been forced to queue in the pitlane behind lewis
5235896 team orders which interfere with a race result are prohibited
5235897 lewis is an egomaniac he ruined fernandos season through his ego vice versa omgrofls
5235898 we want your teammate to win even though hes slower
5235899 such are the pleasures of life for hamilton who now rules mclaren like a young prince like him believe that it is his destiny not only to win the world championship this year but for many years hence
5235900 the engine of car number 22 is kept sealed in order to carry out further checks according to article 5 of the 2008 fia formula one technical regulations these checks will be done before the hungarian gp
5235901 i would never win the championship in ml because they do not want me to win it
5235902 team strategy is what you bring to bear to win a grand prix team orders is what you bring to bear to manipulate a grand prix
5235903 its a device for controlling traction even though its manual they are still controlling traction which would explain why in the british gp they didnt have traction problems and why in the german gp they had next to no wheel spin or lack of traction while others slipped the back end out from time to time
5235904 we think it is wrong the championship should be decided in such a manner
5235905 the fia has begun its annual routine random checks on all formula one engines with mercedes benz the first manufacturer whose power unit will be examined formula ones current regulations feature an engine freeze which prevents manufacturers from making technical changes over the course of the season from the specification that is lodged with the fia at the beginning of the year part of the fias regulatory activities includes it conducting a random test on the engines of each of the six manufacturers to check no modifications have been made that process began after hockenheim with lewis hamiltons engine being the first to be sealed by the fia so its checks can be conducted inspection of other manufacturers engines will take place over the remainder of the season autosport com understand that the engine checking process has begun a little later than normal this year because the fia has introduced some more stringent testing apparatus into the procedure
5235906 with freedom comes responsibility that is why we have libel laws that is why there are laws to protect the innocent from hate filled accusations that are made up purely to hurt others
5235907 hes a little bit more inconsistent this season but hes a young lad and hes going to be going forward all the time he is going to be more than likely the best british driver ever and he will rival schumacher hes got a lot of guts he doesnt care he just goes for it and hell win whatever the conditions he was brilliant today he said the right thing his parents have been behind him and thats the most important thing we are behind our kids exactly the same
5235908 he is fantastically down to earth just a really nice guy i watch every grand prix with him in it thats why we are here today he will be world champion this year he is definitely going to pull it back it will be an absolutely fantastic year everyone i was standing with were taking pictures and they were really really buying into what he was saying and i think he is just very very good with crowd spirit so he definitely gets everybody on his side its nice that hes taken time out of his life to come down here
5235909 i mean the guy is absolutely so good i knew he was going to come out and be a winner like last year i thought it was no surprise that he did so well hes got something special in his mental approach hes comfortable with it all the more comfortable you are the more easily you can deal with things and it looked like straight away he was going to come out and be a winner we know what motor racings like anything can happen to a driver or a constructor but inside he knows hes got it and hes got inner patience as well he knows that one day he is going to make it
5235910 i think silverstone showed that anything can happen and you can achieve anything when you put your mind to it even with all the tough things going on around outside you just home in and focus on what you really want if you have the desire then anything is possible and i showed that weekend that even though i was fourth and things werent looking great and great things werent being said about me i was able to pull out a good race and do a good job
5235911 he will if not already be the most global f1 figure of all time where hell transcend the world of f1 in a way not seen before
5235912 david jones just to point out that most drivers would probably win in a winning car and mclaren is definitely winnning car there are two winning cars on the grid right now or four depends on how you look at it i think i know what you mean but it didnt probably come out properly
5235913 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with european countries to integrate its information
5235914 een verfrissende versie van de tijdloze klassieker met toegankelijke gameplay voor alle leeftijden en niveaus
5235915 a ideia que eu tenho esta se os partidos pol ticos continuarem neste ramerr o nesta monotonia nesta falta de imagina o nesta demiss o que o que se passa com os partidos pol ticos excep o do pcp e o ps se for entronizando como uma esp cie de uni o nacional do regime h que fazer um novo partido
5235916 for years ive been doing my moms job it paid the same for her as it does for me some times you find what youre looking for and thats when the disappointment starts who knew reading the obituaries every day could be such a chore one person lives to 107 another to 77 a warehouse worker is my age as i scan three pages i notice one resident is 43 another resident is 46 a teacher is 44 and a student is 16 others fall into other eras
5235917 after consultations with legal advisers and close political supporters and on their advice im taking the decision of resigning
5235918 my resignation will go to the speaker of the national assembly today
5235919 not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me
5235920 no charge can be proved against me because i never did anything for myself it was all for pakistan

5235932 the car was getting better and better and our set up was working very well fernando even used a bit of our set up as i think they went the wrong way a bit
5235933 then the driver in the smoky yellow helmet in the car with no22 on its silver nose set about butchering massas lead as heidfeld pitted like a lion stalking his lunch there was only one way this was going to end as hamilton put the brazilian out of his misery at the spitzkehre hairpin his favourite killing ground
5235934 he mastered the field again as senna or schumacher when they had the best car by a large margin
5235935 some of you are clearly exercised by the way lewis went past heikki all i would say is that there is a balance of power there and heikki is not the powerful one he drove the same car as lewis albeit set up differently to much less effect there are no overall team orders at mclaren but you would have to be pretty insensible not to notice that lewis is number one in every way as i mentioned in todays paper lewis is like the prince of that team the overtake occupies a grey area but mclaren know how to manage these things within the law just as ferrari do how many people seriously believe that felipe would not have won last seasons brazilian grand prix had not kimi needed the points for the title
5235936 predicted that lewis and mclarens title challenge was about to evaporate
5235937 it is a question that will involve only raikkonen and massa in the second part of the championship
5235938 looooong stints dammmmmmit you know you can get into the points so do a loooong stint like piquet otherwise you will never get onto the podium
5235939 it is a question that will involve only raikkonen and massa in the second part of the championship
5235940 it was quite a bad weekend for nelsinho but suddenly he got a safety car on the best possible lap for him and he is on the podium
5235941 all they did was let the fastest man through just as f1 teams do all the time and have always done
5235942 he must be hating how lewis has driven in the past two races more so knowing that had he behaved last year he would still be in a winning team big mistake
5235943 it may not be breaking the legal guidelines but it sure if pushing the moral ones
5235944 after the two races in north america people thought we had nothing more to give but now after two wins they celebrate us like kings in the end not that much has changed other then that i feel happy obviously
5235945 his latest results not only show that he has the best car of the last 2 races it also shows that he knows how to drive it fast towards pole position
5235946 mclaren has been able to run with reduced vent size
5235947 put kubica or probably raikkonen or even fernando alonso in the same car and we will see if lewis is sooooo much better than everyone else
5235948 if the oil is too thick it retards the movement of the engine parts
5235949 as for nelson well for a guy who had just been gifted his first podium in formula one he looked seriously pissed off
5235950 the two kinds of relative clauses to one of which
5235951 ill only carry on doing this as long as im enjoying it
5235952 this year i feel strong and motivated because i have everything i need to fight on an equal footing
5235953 i am not so bothered by this there are more important things in life
5235954 to assume that any one of these three drivers featured above will even be at interlagos next october is to say the least making assumptions that history shows to be irresponsibly presumptuous
5235955 tony have you heard about this new team jean todt is forming
5235956 no luca thats the first ive heard about it man i like that jacket can i get three
5235957 sure i know this great tailor in modena the tailor of modena
5235958 thanks mate ill get you my sons autograph on the back of a packet of organic buccatini
5235959 ooh oh theres that pain in the proverbial ed b g gorman with that camera of his gor blimey his mince pies are everywhere
5235960 on the other hand there are those who say relations between
5235961 snapped exclusively by the times formula one weblogs very own crap photographer
5235962 go figure in fact dont bother best off without any of your pointless rubbish
5235963 ps hamilton owes mclaren about as much as they owe him its a symbaotic relationship they need each other equally its business
5235964 id say bring it on this time lewis wont have 1 status and fernando will wipe the floor with him
5235965 lh without mclaren would be at the end of the grid trying to get a point with a force india or similar
5235966 lewis hamilton will only attain global status if he signs for the reds of ferrari since they are the man united of f1
5235967 in the position that we are in the championship we cannot risk that much we have to take a tyre that we know that works ok and maybe we cannot pick a tyre thats maybe one tenth quicker but only maybe
5235968 a weight able to move inside the car to balance out some of the unwanted movement of the suspension over bumps and increase mechanical grip
5235969 tires count for one third of the overall performance of the package
5235970 im all for it because i think alonso is simply unbeatable on michelins and although some people think his renault ones were tailor made for him especially there is nothing barring us from thinking that schumachers bridgestones were tailor made
5235971 i do not care islam says there cannot be anyone between allah and his disciple how come these clergymen are interfering in our matter
5235972 i wont ask anyone to go for this kind of marriage
5235973 choe su hon was appointed as dprk ambassador to syria according to a decree of the presidium of the dprk supreme peoples assembly

5235975 i wouldnt have expected anything else from the boro fans
5235976 i would have probably done the same in their position
5235977 of course middlesbrough fans will boo me theyve booed their own players before so i expect to get booed
5235978 i left my home town club to join a team that was on the up and is still on the up
5235979 hes a young coach who is highly motivated and very clear with his plans for the team
5235980 its very important that there is continuity leaving the coach to do his work and not to act hastily if something goes badly
5235981 very few manage it i am convinced that it was the correct step
5235982 any acclimatisation takes time and ive had more good games than bad recently
5235983 its us verses the villages and shes doing their bidding
5235984 the villages has handpicked its candidate but that doesnt mean the villagers have a candidate
5235985 the villages is just a speck of what i would serve
5235986 im concerned about the seniors the families everyone inside the district
5235987 we have five research institutes at five universities in florida and were sitting in the middle of them with a high senior population
5235988 health care industries good companies need to be here and we have to go after them
5235989 the talent is here but we have no jobs to keep people here
5235990 jobs are where we are lacking and we have to get better
5235991 we have to get them here and well work with the commissions and the districts around us to create a biomedical corridor from marion county to clermont
5235992 that would give more health care options to residents here which would be a win win for everyone
5235993 there are a lot of big issues that have to be resolved and we have to get by november before anything gets accomplished
5235994 i have no delusions i realize that the incoming speaker decides what were going to do but id like to focus on the economy and education
5235995 before you receive tax pay services you should have to be a citizen
5235996 it costs us billions of dollars right now to support illegal aliens we have to discourage illegal immigration
5235997 if we help that problem we do a lot for the florida tax base
5235998 this is a diverse district and i want to do my due diligence in staying in touch
5235999 this is not a career for me i want to serve
5236000 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies with their advice i have decided to resign
5236001 i leave it to the people to decide let them be judges and let them do justice though i am sure no charge can stand against me i do not want instability and confrontation in the country
5236002 i do not want the office of president to come under impeachment procedure i think this is not the time for individual bravado
5236003 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty
5236004 for the interest of the nation i have decided to resign as president
5236005 i am not asking for anything i will let the people of pakistan decide my future
5236006 de supersmoker zou verboden moeten worden het is nog steeds ongezond
5236007 if it were your team would you really bother risking an incident while one of your drivers overtook the other
5236008 no f1 race should be awarded to any circuit anywhere in the world if they cant fill the seats
5236009 unlike other teams we allow are drivers to race one another
5236010 if righteous ron were not an englishman then he would have been crucified long ago both by the british media and a plethora of purportedly impartial f1 fans
5236011 this is my race to win therefore your other blokes need to simply make room for me to drive as i please
5236012 all i said was that the message to lewis was not to push alonso and preserve the 1 2 exactly as happened
5236013 forcing massa off track was absolutely schumacher esque have been a fan since he made his debut but i found this bit of driving somewhat offputting
5236014 drivers are obliged to allow faster drivers to pass and in the case of hk moving over to allow lh to pass he was obliged to do so to make way for the faster car
5236015 why are you giving me these set of used hard tyres instead of fresh soft ones
5236016 we dont issue team orders we allow our drivers to race each other
5236017 lets take risks and impale nick with this two million dollar renault
5236018 so magic alonso never makes any mistakes i seem to remember him sticking with worn out inters at the last gp looked like a pretty big mistake to me
5236019 alonso is quoted as saying that whatever team he drives for there will always be a better one
5236020 if you look a lot of my comments are to refute some piece of nonsense that someone else has posted normally through bias or ignorance
5236021 ok both sides say it didnt work out but i think that we had all worked that out had we not
5236022 i notice alonso is quoted as saying that what ever team he drives for there will always be a better one
5236023 as i pointed out elsewhere it has been harder for them than for anyone else to adapt to this years regs
5236024 why should you examine your writing style with the idea of improving it do so as a mark of respect for your readers whatever youre writing if you scribble your thoughts any which way your readers will surely feel that you care nothing about them they will mark you down as an egomaniac or a chowderhead or worse they will stop reading you
5236025 mclaren has also agreed to the reimbursement of ferraris costs and expenses relating to these matters and a concluding payment
5236026 who is this fellow eddie irvine that i see is the companys second highest paid employee
5236027 i would love to know if as a two time champion alonso had it in his contract that he would be the number one driver or he just assumed that he would be treated as such
5236028 if it was me in charge of such a team and one of my crew not only cheated and put the very existence of the team at risk but then became the major prosecution witness against us i would have called the taxi myself if you add onto that the way rd was informed of his cheating by alonso i would have made him walk to the railway station alonsos lasting legacy to mclaren was the 50m hole in the budget
5236029 you think you can push me around well just watch me
5236030 we believe that it is wrong for the championship to be decided in this manner
5236031 you are right it was the two spaniards de la rosa and alonso who were to blame a noble englishman would never do such a thing
5236032 mclaren is guilty and we will prove it on court
5236033 we cant concede too many goals like we did last season it would be great to eliminate that and still score a lot of goals
5236034 we know we can improve defensively and we will continue working hard to do that we are good enough as a team to cut down on the goals we concede
5236035 it is a new defence with a new goalkeeper and that will not develop overnight the new guys played well
5236036 brad friedel is a good goalkeeper you can see that i thought luke young and nicky shorey also played well but it takes time to play together and be comfortable together
5236037 but well get that right we have to look at it as a whole team and we know we need to do better defensively
5236038 but we are still happy with the start to the season we have made if we can keep scoring goals and start to concede fewer goals that is perfect
5236039 it was important to get off to a winning start we have done well in our important games in the pre season we got the right result in the intertoto cup and we played well in iceland in the uefa cup on thursday

5236050 a wow signing i am looking forward to that very much saviola would be nice dennis wise tony jiminez derek llambias we are working really well together to get quality players in i definitely expect one or two but i dont know what the wow signing could be i cant wait to find out when i get home
5236051 too often in the last few years newcastle have got people in who have not been good enough theyve not settled or not understood what it is to play for newcastle united
5236052 the three we have so far are right men and the next three we get have got to be too
5236053 he is a real team player from the minute he came to the club the boys accepted him straight away he has been a man not a boy about the place and so has coloccini he only had one training session with the group from the minute we came here i didnt expect us to do anything apart from what we did we got a performance from everyone you show them that video in the week and how hard they worked and say do it again
5236054 we had the courage to play you need a bit of luck and you need the top players to have a game shay kept us in it we were unlucky to lose the lead steven taylor was off the pitch when they scored

5236056 i absolutely believe that if wed have had that election that gordon brown would no longer have been prime minister and that the conservatives would have been the largest party in a hung parliament
5236057 brown compounded calling off the election by then saying it was nothing to do with the polls which was a massive mistake it was a lie and it was treating people like fools
5236058 you appoint good people and trust their decisions but you have to know when to step in william hague has really helped me because he made all the mistakes the first time round
5236059 samantha is actually very unconventional and hard to put in a box she went to a day school was a goth at 14 had quite a wild childhood is unconventional and challenging and that is very good as it stopped me being too straight down the line
5236060 i tend to cry when im happy and i did then and then samantha started crying
5236061 sometimes maybe i put off making decisions that maybe i should have taken earlier
5236062 i remember going for a drink and it was just after john smith died and we said it will be blair who becomes leader and that will be disastrous for us
5236063 im a pretty classic church of england racked with doubt and scepticism believer
5236064 i think im canine rather than feline i like company i like people and that is much more dog like than cat like and im more of a dog lover
5236065 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good
5236066 the russian general vyacheslav borisov promised last night to start the pullout at 10am but so far there is no sign
5236067 we will ask the leadership of the russian federation for there to be a russian military base on the territory of south ossetia because russian citizens live here
5236068 we will ask the russian leadership it is their decision
5236069 i consider the government was not working effectively so i signed the decree to sack it
5236070 we have created an emergency commission to liquidate the consequences of the georgian aggression this is connected to the fact that several members of the government are incapable of acting in such a serious military situation
5236071 an international security mission should be deployed to help protect civilians and create a safe environment for the displaced to return home and international organisations should also send fact finding missions to establish the facts report on human rights and urge the authorities to account for any crimes
5236072 in my research students are certainly experiencing a higher inflationary rate because the cost of what they need to buy is among the highest categories of price rises
5236073 to say that this will be the most expensive academic year for higher education students to date would not be stretching it for many students it is their first experience of independence and stepping out into the current economic climate will be a hard lesson in itself
5236074 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
5236075 i was a young irresponsible fool when i made ce3k now that im an egotistical adult with countless real and adopted children im appalled to have made a film showing a father abandoning his family to get on an alien spaceship i would never make that movie today im horrified i did it and hope in the future to re film an ending that reunites roy neary with his family and shows that nasty mothership imploding upon liftoff

5236125 wir haben mit nummer eins den wettkampf er ffnet da bekommt man nat rlich nicht so hohe punkte wie gegen ende
5236126 vom gef hl her war es heute ziemlich gut wir sind recht sauber geschwommen
5236127 wir wollen hier an zwei tagen das zeigen was wir trainiert und vorbereitet haben in der freien und um eine minute l ngeren k r sind der kreativit t keine grenzen gesetzt ich freu mich drauf
5236128 wir wollen uns mit dieser olympiateilnahme nach oben arbeiten und vielleicht 2012 im finale mitschwimmen
5236129 wir wollen das feeling von hier mitnehmen und davon profitieren damit irgendwann ein finale realistischer wird

5236131 what difference does this have from islamic terror camps just tht this is a smaller magnitude thing next we are going to see churches creating bombs and training sessions on how to kill and crap
5236132 well wtf is small kids doing on that then they are in fact being taught to hate which is totally against the god is love concept of the church
5236133 the phase i of the project was completed in less than 7 months including all the approvals
5236134 and we could not have been successful without the family and friends who have local presence
5236135 we want to bring some level of research orientation among faculty and students at nuva
5236136 i think the time is perfect for technocrats and particularly bits alumni to enter the field
5236137 not as employees but as founders and management who are the real decision makers and we can involve our friends and well wishers in these projects
5236138 somebody had to make the first move and start the first private engineering college where founders were bitsians
5236139 just imagine the collective impact of say 6 bits pilani campuses and 10 alumni founded colleges after 5 years without doubt this will help make bits pilani as probably the biggest brand for engineering education in india
5236140 we are working on a common structure guidelines and use of a common name which will also help strengthen bits pilani brand obviously these colleges will not use bits name and will be at locations where bits pilani does not plan to open a campus these colleges will take complementary role to bits pilani in all aspects and potential areas for collaboration and cooperation will be soon explored
5236141 and nuva is special because it is the first such college the team is gearing up for conquering next coimbatore and dehradun
5236142 we are so pleased and excited to be a part of this admirable event
5236143 so many of our dreams at first seem impossible then they seem improbable and then when we summon the will they soon become inevitable
5236144 you have given us your shoulders to stand on to reach our dreams

5236152 encajar dos goles en casa no es muy bueno pero el equipo ha trabajado muy bien en defensa no se ha estado tan mal y los goles del madrid han llegado en dos jugadas aisladas porque ellos tienen jugadores que resuelven muy bien

5236154 es ist wichtig dass wir einen sehr guten torwart haben unsere abwehr profitiert enorm von seiner erfahrung
5236155 er hat ja auch schon in den spielen zuvor bewiesen dass er nicht umsonst die nummer 1 im deutschen tor gewesen ist
5236156 es ist immer etwas besonderes nach so langer zeit wieder in der bundesliga zu spielen
5236157 wie er den ball von karim matmour gehalten hat war fantastisch
5236158 wir sind schon sehr zufrieden mit dieser guten leistung die mannschaft hat sehr intelligent gespielt
5236159 beim zweiten und dritten tor wurden wir gnadenlos abgestraft das macht den unterschied zwischen bundesliga und 2 liga aus da mussten wir lehrgeld zahlen

5236189 wolves were interested but after meeting chris coleman my head wasnt going to be turned anywhere else
5236190 i could have gone to wolves but after speaking to chris i fancied going to coventry
5236191 i thought that coventry had the ability to go on and do some good things that was my mind made up basically
5236192 mick mccarthy is a very good manager and im not going to lie it was a difficult decision i just want to play but i didnt know if i would every week at wolves
5236193 ive got a chance to play most weeks at coventry and i just want to do well
5236194 i know youve got to fight for you position wherever you go but the manager here was optimistic about taking this club forward
5236195 at one stage i thought the deal to go to coventry was dead then i thought that maybe i would be going to wolves but chris did well along with the top man at the club ray ranson and thats why in the end i showed my appreciation by signing here
5236196 i know what mick is like mick likes hard working players that like to run around which is not freddys job
5236197 obviously i know how to work under mick because i worked with him with ireland so that wasnt a factor
5236198 the factor was that the manager here got me before i went and spoke to mick
5236199 chris took the time to meet me and show me the clubs plans i was really impressed by that
5236200 i only know damien johnson at blues now but i knew lee carsley who i worked with for ireland and he is another one who told me to come to coventry
5236201 he said its a good club and if he hadnt signed for birmingham then he probably would have come here as well
5236202 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights
5236203 he didnt have to worry about how his answer would be perceived he didnt have to work to recall his talking points he didnt have to think or even try to look like he was thinking all he had to do was blurt out what he believed clearly this gave him an unfair advantage and we think the american people will see this for what it is another republican smear tactic

5236228 they keep training in china because they realize these are better options than they have in the u s
5236229 this is a special case they want to train hard they understand they have to go to china and sacrifice and train all year long usually if the athletes believe they dont have a good chance they wont go to china these girls they want to play well and do the best they can
5236230 thats the best way to make me have the good performance
5236231 if you want the best results china is the place for the players to train
5236232 if i want to play good i have to go to china to train
5236233 in u s nobody was training with me nobody practiced with me in the u s theres not many good players we have some but we dont live together so its very hard for us to train in the u s
5236234 thats one of the arguments that we need to develop our kids identify them at an early age make sure they have the right training and right competition and make sure they go to school

5236243 it was just a fantastic feeling im feeling very proud to be a singaporean knowing that our athletes have done their very best and won us a silver medal after 48 years
5236244 the whole crowd was cheering them on including our own supporters here in the stadium in beijing and my heart swelled weve waited so long for singapore athletes to be able to get a medal in the olympic games
5236245 i was cdm chef de mission for the busan asian games we also had the highest number of gold medals when i was cdm for the commonwealth games in melbourne we also beat the manchester games in terms of gold medals so next time if they want to achieve something they better invite me
5236246 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5236247 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion
5236248 the substance of what theyre doing here is fundamentally the same
5236249 now the chinese economy has already slowed in the months leading up to the olympic games but that slowdown has little to do with the olympic games itself the slowdown in china has to do with the global economy rising import prices and a slowdown in exports
5236250 the leading banks in china will be relatively insulated from the credit problems elsewhere coal prices have gone up by 72 per cent so far this year but share prices have gone down 50 per cent what is going on you talk to any buyers of coal and they will tell you that supply is tight

5236252 im always early so i fit into the timing anyway i think its not as tangible as having direct discount on travel cost i guess greater discount on travel cost may help
5236253 if you can save 10 cents i think it still helps a little i prefer to come to work early on time and have time for breakfast before work i usually have it outside so i think this incentive benefits me

5236270 our match earlier this year in riyadh demonstrated the passion our saudi fans have for manchester united and we believe this ground breaking partnership will bring the action of manchester united direct to our millions of fans across saudi arabia
5236271 the partnership will significantly enhance stcs profile benefiting from the clubs unrivaled fan base throughout the middle east and especially in saudi arabia
5236272 one of the most exciting aspects of our partnership with manchester united is the opportunity to attain new levels of marketing excellence
5236273 the club has a brilliant track record of global success in branding and we will be working closely with a specialist marketing team from manchester united to develop innovative ideas to support the partnership

5236335 repeat offenders travelling from country to country and flagrantly avoiding the stringent sex offender mechanisms in the uk
5236336 many of them have been teachers or volunteers in orphanages
5236337 offenders are always trying to find new ways to access vulnerable children
5236338 this sends a strong message to so called sex tourists that they wont get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk
5236339 from the autumn we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad presently sex offenders have to notify police if they will be abroad for three days or more

5236342 controlling the conformation of peptides is not easy our previous studies showed that soft landing can be used to prepare ultrapure peptide layers on substrates
5236343 the question we faced was in addition to controlling purity can we also control the structure of the molecules we showed we could
5236344 we found an interesting pathway to conduct different types of chemical reactions between complex molecules and substrates that will potentially enable us to prepare materials that cannot be made by standard methods
5236345 i thought what can i do to make my babies proud i think about what theyll think about the year they were born who i was and what i did

5236348 up to 2 4 percent of the u s population self identifies as mixed race and most of these individuals describe themselves as biracial

5236350 my loyalty is to the democrats winning barack obama is going to have a serious problem getting elected for good reason the party needs to face the fact that without hillary clinton on the ticket the democrats will probably lose

5236358 it was a shame because crown bowling had a long tradition in the village the club had previously been going for 76 years
5236359 people were pretty upset at the time and there have been various attempts in the intervening years to revive the club but none of them came to fruition
5236360 everyones delighted that we managed to crack it this time at last brewood crown bowling is back
5236361 i hadnt heard about this it has got to go before the parish council yet but its history that being got rid of and i would think there would be opposition
5236362 i would eat healthy things but in huge quantities and despite being good at sport at school i could never last a whole match because of my size
5236363 things came to a head at new year all my friends were talking about the dresses they would wear and got so much attention when we were out we had booked a summer holiday in zante and i vowed that by then i would be one of those slim confident girls i never wanted to feel like that again and the holiday gave me a target to aim for this was a big bonus i knew i was working to a tight deadline
5236364 every wage packet since i started losing weight has gone on clothes my dress size was falling every month i have just got back from zante where we had an amazing time
5236365 it seems quite high although obviously these are not necessarily all the polices fault i am a bit baffled about why there would be so many police drivers should be trained to the highest standards
5236366 west midlands police employs temporary staff to provide extra resources to cover short term projects and staffing shortages

5236368 we have around 55 dogs here at the moment and we just cant take anymore
5236369 it is also proving very expensive because the more dogs we have to look after the higher the cost and because we rely on donations we need all the help we can get
5236370 if we werent here these dogs would have nowhere to go and no one to look after them
5236371 but we need the help of the public in providing us with things like bedding disinfectant dog food and anything else
5236372 it has never been as tough as this at the centre times are hard a lot of it is because the police dont take in dogs anymore so we are getting a lot more to cope with
5236373 people can actually go up to the centre for a day out and play with the dogs a bit and it is great
5236374 you take along some donations like dog food or blankets and it is a lovely day out for a family
5236375 when i went for my interview to work at the black country living museum 10 years ago i said i had always been interested in black country traditions
5236376 it is that same interest that has led to me creating such a unique wedding
5236377 i sang first time i ever saw your face in memory of my mum christine
5236378 before the ceremony everyone was saying to me where are your nerves but i was really looking forward to it
5236379 debbie had done most of the organising for the wedding but i came up with the idea for the pork pie wedding cake
5236380 most weddings follow the same format and you can often forget what happened at each different one but no one is going to forget this and at least i will be able to look back and laugh at the photos
5236381 bird troubles are an early warning system that all is not well for the natural systems that we depend on nature has always had to adapt to change but the difference here is the speed of adaptation
5236382 it is not just bird life bees are having a terrible time and the meteorological chaos is wreaking havoc with butterflies and if the pollinators dont pollinate the farmers have got problems its all linked
5236383 were going on a walk a real one around the neighbourhood

5236386 now the not operator is gone in yahoo and searchers will have to stick to the search engine math operator to achieve the same effect put a minus sign directly in front of a term that you want excluded from search result meaning that yahoo will exclude pages that has that term in their text
5236387 i have had this blog for about five months now and have never had an issue with the sitemap i usually recd a google bot within minutes of posting a new entry or an update starting around the 1st of august i noticed that the google bots had stopped arriving so i resubmitted my sitemap thinking that there might have been a glitch since that time the submission has been in a pending state at first i resubmitted after 24 hours but no change at this point the sitemap has been pending for about three days last night at around 10 00pm i recd a google bot the problem i have is that the sitemap submission is still pending and none of the articles that ive posted since 2 august have been added to google does anyone know why my sitemap is pending it appears others are having a problem with their sitemap pending as well
5236388 no one in blogger forum is replying hope this issue solve soon else our blogs will be dead as you said webado that my site is loading slow i completly changed the site theme and made it using default blogger templates its superfast now but googlebot is super super slow still travelling all over internet to find our blog and not able to find

5236392 thank you for contacting me regarding h r 5889 the orphan works act of 2008 based on the large volume of mail my office has received regarding this bill i recognize that this is an issue of great importance to the people of upstate new york i also understand your concerns regarding this piece of legislation and therefore if this bill were to come to the house floor i would vote against it

5236399 seems like a small premium worth paying to get the approval of the special committee the extra money is neither here nor there for mufg they just want to get the deal done without any major problems
5236400 the main issue of this acquisition is whether mufg can operate unionbanccal better than the current shareholders there is no previous example of this kind of acquisition by a japanese bank succeeding

5236410 im gonna get me a shotgun and kill all the whities i see
5236411 i dont think its fair i think the city better make some fast decisions
5236412 you cant even get your mind around what has happened but sometimes now i get really angry
5236413 from everything ive gotten from the flood task force i would say its in the millions
5236414 i dont know for certain if its in the millions but i know its a tremendous burden on families
5236415 i havent penciled around on it but it feels right to me particularly if there are hundreds of homes
5236416 right now the way it is if they have to put all that money back into a home and then theyre going to demolish it anyway thats going to be a stupid use of dollars and expensive
5236417 a lot of evils been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
5236418 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
5236419 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
5236420 yes yes and find bad teachers another line of work
5236421 you know were going to end this youre answering so quickly you want to play a game of poker
5236422 my friends we spent 3 million of your money to study the dna of bears in montana
5236423 now i dont know if that was a paternity issue or a criminal issue
5236424 hes the only one with the experience strength and knowledge to save us from sinking
5236425 david is definitely in close talks with the owners dont be surprised to see him step into the big job
5236426 i bet i did 8 to 10 radio interviews a day for the first three weeks earned any appreciable traction weei
5236427 every boston friend i have is oddly meticulous about the station they know whos on at pretty much every hour and can psychologically break down every broadcaster for biases weaknesses and favorite in break snack
5236428 its pretty difficult to find any community like that anywhere plus you know they asked
5236429 the goal for weei com is to get the best people to be creative and to be ahead of the curve will has built his reputation with his creativity
5236430 we sometimes lose ourselves in our own little world here hell bring perspective as to how were being perceived from beyond route 495
5236431 oh im certainly not counting on any sort of acceptance i honestly have no idea how this will work
5236432 theyve given me pretty free reign with it but from the get go im making it as clear as possible that im no expert in boston sports thats why i hope it will be fun i think when youre in the middle of the maelstrom it can be difficult to fathom how the rest of the world sees you
5236433 right now boston is the most compelling sports city in america its not even close
5236434 im hoping to tap into that look at the manny situation when he started acting up the rest of the planet was like well there he goes again theyll figure it out like they always do
5236435 boston fans knew better they knew the atmosphere had changed thats amazing to me the citys fandom is a palpable breathing thing its fascinating to watch
5236436 i want to try to figure that out ill probably fail but hopefully itll be fun trying and hey ive been writing online for a long time i can certainly take whatever criticism comes my way im sure ill deserve just about all of it
5236437 id be pretty honored to be compared to simmons until you realize how poorly one measures up to simmons and then im screwed
5236438 simmons oozed boston sports from his pores back in the day i wont be doing that i couldnt if i tried but hey nobody wants a st louis sports guy if people are expecting me to be a new simmons theyll be sorely disappointed but i dont think anybody expects that
5236439 my plates pretty full right now im working on the next book im writing a page for
5236440 everyone here is so freaking smart im honored they think i could possibly keep up i cant
5236441 and of course ill keep popping by deadspin whenever leitchs replacement aj daulerio lets me
5236442 hopefully by the end of january we will be at full capacity first we have to become must bookmark and i think were well on our way to that with this first round of development
5236443 we approached will because he is one of the most creative and talented writers out there today
5236444 were getting the best people at what they do and that will mean a combination of old school journalists and new media people as well
5236445 were not trying to emulate boston com or bostonherald com and we dont necessarily have to beat them or replace them
5236446 well offer a unique perspective and be a source of both news and entertainment and well do it with a new cast of editorial voices to add to the compelling and informative audio content we already have from weei
5236447 when i talked to ron the only thing i needed to know from him was whether he was ready to kick some butt
5236448 he is some people will forget about his past and some wont and i get that but i think he is motivated to put some of that stuff to rest and that motivation serves us well
5236449 the depth of penetration in 25 54 year old male demographic is incredible its the model for this segment of radio in many ways
5236450 any media company that reaches a broad segment is at a point now where they have to act quickly to leverage these assets they have
5236451 thats what entercom and david field is doing by investing in the web this is the way broadcasting in general is going
5236452 what scares me is that theres a large graveyard full of the web entries that had huge traffic but couldnt monetize it
5236453 weei has already done that and this will allows us to further that the site as it is is currently profitable
5236454 ron and mike will perspective that will be somewhat in contrast to a lot of what is on the air and that will help give a 360 degree perspective on the patriots
5236455 were very comfortable bringing ron on board and hes eager to re establish himself he was must read in the globe were aware of his past and hes excited to move forward
5236456 its a clean slate we can mold things the way we want weve got resources were not doing this on the cheap and weve also got all this amazing audio to use which no one else has
5236457 people get it they know what this opportunity is its cool that people are seeing what i saw when i took the job
5236458 this is not out of altruism that they are doing this this is the next revenue stream and they see that
5236459 they saw they could earn revenue from putting signage on the wall they saw they could get naming rights money you drill holes and see what comes up from beneath for weei com they arent cutting any corners i think it has potential to be a game changer
5236460 i think in their wildest dreams they probably see that it could become as a local version of espn com with all these ways to cross promote and sell
5236461 well all columns about la would start three paragraphs in and end four paragraphs early and those would be a bitch to edit
5236462 he describes manny ramirez as a dingbat red sox slugger sox pitcher curt schilling as not satisfied until he is deemed king and bill belichick as the napoleonic patriots coach hated by anyone who happens not to work for him
5236463 ive known tony massarotti as a friend for nearly two decades and as a co worker for almost as long although i will miss the daily give and take ive enjoyed with tony along with his contributions to the herald were already in the process of interviewing candidates to fill the vacancies on our sports staff
5236464 in the culture of the old testament satan had destroyed jobs ability to worship when he took away the mans herds of sacrificial animals
5236465 then job arose tore his robe and shaved his head and he fell to the ground and worshiped
5236466 daddy isnt that the man who just had brain surgery
5236467 but those who wait on the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings like eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint

5236537 sab a lo que necesitaba hacer para estar en el podio y cuando clav la salida sab a que estaba ah
5236538 mi baza estaba en ejecutar mejor que los dem s porque ten a menos nota de salida por la dificultad y lo he hecho mejor que seis el chino ha tenido un par de elementos que no ha finalizado bien y que pens que le iban a puntuar con menos nota pek n 2008 si hab a igualdad iban a tirar hacia su lado
5236539 las tres medallas me saben a oro y en todas he alucinado con el ambiente
5236540 al final hay satisfacci n porque en el computo general el valencia hizo un gran partido pese a la adversidad del 0 1 se ha levantado y ha sido el que ha tenido una l nea m s de intensidad de agresividad y de querer
5236541 llevamos trabajando un mes y un poquito y poco a poco tratamos de darle al equipo tranquilidad y naturalidad para entrenar y jugar y eso es b sico los futbolistas se han encontrado c modos en el campo y ha habido una uni n muy importante con el p blico
5236542 la m s sincera enhorabuena en nombre de la generalitat y de todos los valencianos por haber escrito una p gina de oro en la historia del deporte valenciano y espa ol ya que es la primera vez que una valenciana consigue una medalla en esta disciplina
5236543 este xito representa el broche de oro en la carrera de la tenista y en el deporte valenciano y la convierte en la abanderada de los deportistas valencianos en pek n
5236544 medina y ruano que han ejemplificado hoy con su medalla el buen momento por el que pasa el tenis espa ol
5236545 quer a literalmente hacer algo en este deporte que nadie hubiese hecho antes sin la ayuda de mis compa eros no hubiese sido posible vinimos todos juntos como una unidad
5236546 no tengo palabras estos chicos el equipo de relevo estadounidense estuvieron incre bles estos t os lo hicieron posible el relevo realmente lo hizo posible eso demuestra nuestra unidad y trabajo es incre ble ser parte de esto
5236547 ni siquiera s c mo me siento ahora demasiadas emociones
5236548 fui desde golpearme la cabeza contra la pared para ganar por una cent sima de segundo a hacer mi mejor tiempo en cada prueba esto no ha sido sino una monta a rusa hacia arriba
5236549 en algunos momentos se aprovecharon con los goles no estuvimos muy concentrados y tuvimos que haber parado el partido y ser m s inteligentes aunque hemos reaccionado muy bien tras el 2 1
5236550 el valencia esta volviendo a lo que est bamos acostumbrados nadie entend a lo que pas el a o pasado con este equipo porque son los mismos jugadores pero se ha visto que esta en el buen camino otra vez
5236551 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
5236552 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
5236553 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses
5236554 so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
5236555 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
5236556 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
5236557 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
5236558 and the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful

5236568 church isnt a place for questions its a place for answers

5236570 why didnt you ask oh thats right you dont like asking questions
5236571 by a continuing process of inflation governments can confiscate secretly and unobserved an important part of the wealth of their citizens there is no subtler no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency the process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose
5236572 the wheels of government are clogged and we are descending into the vale of confusion and darkness no day was ever more clouded than the present we are fast verging to anarchy and confusion
5236573 paper money polluted the equity of our laws turned them into engines of oppression corrupted the justice of our public administration destroyed the fortunes of thousands who had confidence in it enervated the trade husbandry and manufactures of our country and went far to destroy the morality of our people
5236574 no state shall make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts
5236575 since the federal constitution has removed all the danger of having a paper tender our trade is advanced fifty percent our moneyed people can trust their cash abroad and have brought their coin into circulation
5236576 our country my dear sir is fast progressing in its political importance and social happiness
5236577 tranquility reigns among the people with that disposition towards the general government which is likely to preserve it our public credit stands on that high ground which three years ago it would have been considered as a species of madness to have foretold
5236578 democracy the painted whore an extremist explains war drugs guns god gold and santa claus
5236579 regardless of law marriage has only one definition and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy i will act to destroy that government and bring it down so it can be replaced with a government that will respect and support marriage and help me raise my children in a society where they will expect to marry in their turn only when the marriage of heterosexuals has the support of the whole society can we have our best hope of raising each new generation to aspire to continue our civilization
5236580 no law in any state in the united states now or ever has forbidden homosexuals to marry any homosexual man who can persuade a woman to take him as her husband can avail himself of all the rights of husbandhood under the law ditto with lesbian women to get those civil rights all homosexuals have to do is find someone of the opposite sex willing to join them in marriage
5236581 however emotionally bonded a pair of homosexual lovers may feel themselves to be what they are doing is not marriage they are not turning their relationship into what my wife and i have created because no court has the power to change what their relationship actually is they steal from me what i treasure most and gain for themselves nothing at all they won t be married they ll just be playing dress up in their parents clothes
5236582 in my church and many other churches people still cling fiercely to civilized values and struggle to raise civilized children despite the barbarians who now rule us through the courts
5236583 homosexual marriage won t accomplish what they hope they will still be just as far outside the reproductive cycle of life and they will have inflicted real damage on those of us who are inside it they will make it harder for us to raise children with any confidence that they in turn will take their place in the reproductive cycle
5236584 the glove compartment isnt accurately named and everybody knows it
5236585 this most serious business the behind the scenes of a bid for a job many argued was among the most important on the planet occurred in a room with mats piled in the corner for nap time with the latest poll numbers being passed around like graham crackers
5236586 there were some very odd tableaus that you find yourself in
5236587 it was more like being attached to an ekg monitor on speed the laws of time and space seemed to warp according to levels of adrenaline fatigue and endorphins fed by sugar and caffeine
5236588 he looked as though he was being given last rites
5236589 empty cold packets drained coffee cups discarded diet coke cans and endless wrappers of rapidly devoured candy bars littered the floors
5236590 the bus was a mobile medical unit everyone aboard was sick these were not polite coughs but deep and phlegmy hacks all of it emanated from the reporters berthed in the buss stern and seemed to mist forward spreading the human equivalent of a kennel cough
5236591 you move with such speed that when you actually do have a one on one connection whether it is a rope line or someone stopping you on the street the moments become so vivid
5236592 my father was running for national office to win or lose and my mom was basically fighting for her life to win or lose and the stakes for both were so high it felt very strange that the markers in time were so drawn almost as if they were in a fictional narrative you wouldnt believe it
5236593 i had to push through the crowd like the people on the rope line do
5236594 i was outside the circles and with the burden of my news i was outside the upbeat emotional tone of the moment as well
5236595 we waited lulled by the impression that the advertisements clear bias and inaccuracy would ensure their rapid fall off the radar and out of the news cycle

5236603 it is without question the best weekend britain has had at an olympics
5236604 and it is testament to how far we have come in improving our levels of performance perhaps the key to it is the support we can give our athletes now and 1996 played a key part in that change
5236605 for the last three years all anybody has been talking about has been london london london
5236606 that has focussed minds the boa has stepped up the government has increased its support and the many of the sports have raised their games too
5236607 it is not just a case of home advantage its what theyve been doing in preparation for the last seven years in their case longer as they thought they were going to get the 2000 games
5236608 show that stretch wont be quite so uncomfortable and moynihan is adamant the good times arent quite over yet in china sailing regatta has a long way to go there are still medals to be won in the cycling and were confident of success in lots of other sports too its by no means over
5236609 our athletes coaches and support staff should be proud of their achievements
5236610 at the start of the games one of our ambitions was to achieve around
5236611 we still have another week of great sport to look forward to then we can start to think about how we can build on beijing towards london 2012 and beyond
5236612 the resignation will bring an end to confrontations thus easing the political uncertainty hanging over the market

5236615 according to reliable intelligence reports he is living in cambodia
5236616 an added burden for the millions of pastoralists living in the hot arid areas of east africa
5236617 all too often the direct economic value generated by pastoralists is not retained in their communities and the indirect value is unrewarded and even unacknowledged by decision makers
5236618 they have been adapting to climate variability for millennia and their adaptability ought to enable them to cope with this growing challenge
5236619 however their adaptability cannot be realized without government support and investment
5236620 in the next 10 15 years climate change will mean a continuation of current trends including successive poor rains an increase in drought related shocks and more unpredictable and sometimes heavy rainfall events
5236621 communities must be at the heart of efforts to build their resilience to climate change because adaptation is inherently local
5236622 it will only work if local people are leading the process

5236633 there is a way that seems right to a man but in the end it leads to death
5236634 it was he who gave some to be apostles some to be evangelists and some to be pastors and teachers to prepare gods people for works of service so that the body of christ may be built up
5236635 for i know the plans i have for you declares the lord
5236636 and god is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all things at all times having all that you need you will abound in every good work
5236637 show me your ways o lord teach me your paths guide me in your truth and teach me for you are god my savior and my hope is in you all day long
5236638 where there is no counsel the people fall but in the multitude of counselors there is safety
5236639 in his heart a man plans his course but god determines his steps
5236640 each one should use whatever gifts he has received to serve others faithfully administering gods grace in its various forms
5236641 never be lacking in zeal but keep your spiritual fervor serving the lord
5236642 nanti saya akan menyalakan lilin untuk berdoa agar kamu sekeluarga diberikan keturunan
5236643 waduh romo doanya manjur sekali sepulang dari sana saya selama 3 tahun dapat anak kembar 2 x 3 6 orang sedangkan 4 tahun kemudian 1 x4 4 orang jadi jumlahnya 10 orang semuanya
5236644 nah itulah romo katanya dia kembali ke lourdes untuk memadamkan lilin yang romo nyalakan itu
5236645 gampang untukmu bicara seperti itu karena kamu dapat menyumbang sebagian dari dirimu saja cuma telurmu sedangkan aku bagiku itu adalah komitmen total
5236646 pada saat aku marah marah sama kamu kamu tidak pernah sekalipun melawan aku caranya bagaimana sih melakukan kontrol atas kemarahan kamu kok bisa
5236647 bisa setiap kali kamu marah sama aku aku langsung pergi membersihkan toilet
5236648 wah kok bisa apa hubungannya membersihkan toilet dengan manajemen emosi
5236649 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what fuck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
5236650 when i was a kid all of my generation looked up to rodney pattison and all that he achieved
5236651 it seems a little surreal to be in the position that im in now but its been a long road and ive really enjoyed all of my olympic sailing career whether it was the games or the experience along the way
5236652 hes so young still and he has yet to do more i wouldnt be surprised if he surpassed
5236653 in my lifetime he is the most special sailor weve seen he could certainly go on to beat paul elvstroms record
5236654 its more than just being in a class on his own hes on his own planet
5236655 he just has no weaknesses and his skills are just way in excess of any of the opposition he just makes it look so easy
5236656 he has a special talent he can see the wind better than most he feels the boat better than most and is especially fast downwind but hes also a very aggressive sailor and he takes no prisoners
5236657 we got a glimpse of just how cut throat he is with one move on the start line he completely took out any danger from railey
5236658 he didnt have to win the race all he had to do was to stay with zac but he wanted to he enjoyed the wind and just wanted to stretch his legs
5236659 speaking to the other finn competitors before the games they werent even discussing the possibility of winning gold it was very much who was going to win silver and bronze
5236660 even the danish guy ranked number one said it would be a catastrophe if ben didnt win it zach got into a good position but i think in his heart of hearts he was waiting for the big man to come
5236661 he was so much better than the rest that its hard to see how theyre going to catch up he can do a short term campaign and still be so dominant so i think we will see him come back time and time again
5236662 if he went to a new class like the star he would have to put a bit more time in technically theres a lot more to learn
5236663 but if he was involved in the americas cup i can see him staying in the finn because he knows he can come back in weymouth and win again
5236664 they did so well theyre a very polished team and dont have any weaknesses
5236665 they were a class above everybody else and we saw time and time again that even though they didnt necessarily make the best start they had it in the tool box to do what they needed to do
5236666 ive known sarah ayton for a long time she came out to sydney with me to help in my campaign and theres a great sense of pride to see her doing it for herself
5236667 the communications transport is preferably a com or dcom interface
5236668 i hope such satellites will be more widely accepted in the world satellite market based on this success
5236669 todays flight represents an event of historical significance for mitsubishi electric and we hope for the commercial satellite industry the first japan made commercial telecommunications satellite now we have come up with our own standard satellite platform the ds 2000 with the launch of superbird 7 we will work to establish a firm position in the market as a competitive and reliable japan based commercial satellite manufacturer

5236671 ma avevi detto ci si rivede a settembre tra i banchi di scuola e ora non settembre e la scuola non ancora iniziata
5236672 and i was just waiting for the call back but the race is over and youve just got to put it behind you
5236673 when i crossed the finish line and saw sherone and kerron there that was the moment
5236674 were used to winning it all maybe we take that for granted a bit
5236675 and i was just waiting for the call back but the race is over and youve just got to put it behind you
5236676 when i crossed the finish line and saw sherone and kerron there that was the moment
5236677 were used to winning it all maybe we take that for granted a bit
5236678 were pushing for everyone here but were so elated to be able to be the last race
5236679 i think the guy on my right youre looking at one of the greatest athletes in sports in general
5236680 what he did today what he did this entire week beat the tour de france beat the pressure putt in the u s open beat every part of what sport is
5236681 and when you do something like that you got to tip your hat off to him every single athlete in the world needs to tip his hat to michael phelps because what he did this week was absolutely incredible
5236682 before the race i looked up there and i saw kobe bryant and lebron james the two best players in the world in basketball
5236683 i dont know basketball but theres just no way i was going to let those guys down they came out to watch us

5236762 i am the commander in chief i cannot allow these soldiers to grab peoples land
5236763 i am going to firmly look at this matter and whoever is involved in this land grabbing should stop immediately
5236764 we told the president that these soldiers have blocked the return of our people because they want to grab their land and he was disappointed
5236765 in fact at this point he said he would handle the matter urgently such that our people the rerun to their homes as per the government resettlement programme

5236776 when the fixtures came out we never thought it would be an easy start
5236777 playing against dundee united in our first game live on television was a hard one but we came of age in the end
5236778 now we are sitting pretty after two games and we could not ask for more
5236779 we played two different kinds of games a passing game against united and a hard fought win against caley thistle
5236780 the youngsters in our team play with an abandon which sometimes you have to control
5236781 i just look at what is in front of me and defend as opposed to someone who can actually play
5236782 i am not getting any younger but i am right on top of the young players in the team it is great i was lucky to get a contract in the summer and now i want to take this chance with both hands
5236783 the enthusiasm of them rubs off on me whereas i give the side that bit of experience
5236784 i was fully aware of the challenge we just came up short
5236785 when you get to the semi final it is puck of the ball stuff exactly what it was today sunday
5236786 i dont think im as effective if i change the way i play because i wont put myself around and get in peoples faces and annoy people if you like
5236787 to be honest i had that problem with darlington last season and i did go off the ball but im not going to change the way i play ive always been a physical player and the manager brought me up here so you cant really change the player you brought in
5236788 ive never been intimidated my dad would give me a slap around the face if i ever did become intimidated ive been brought up that way and i wont shy away in a game and if i do annoy people along the way then so be it
5236789 it was a bit of handbags to be honest as far as im concerned it was a nothing thing we shook hands after the game and thats it
5236790 obviously celtic and rangers make it a more attractive league
5236791 those are the games you want to play in and thats up to the manager if he plays me or not
5236792 ive heard thats the big one thats the big rivalry i do like playing in derbies and that will be a nice feeling
5236793 abbiamo chiesto alla famiglia lonore di poter allestire la camera ardente del presidente franco sensi in campidoglio perch in questo modo vogliamo rappresentare il cordoglio di tutta la citt per la scomparsa di un grande uomo dello sport romano e italiano franco sensi si battuto non soltanto per ottenere i grandi risultati della as roma calcio ma anche perch lo sport non perdesse la sua anima e i suoi valori di fronte alla crescente professionalizzazione e ai grandi interessi economici che ruotano attorno ad esso
5236794 per questo tutta roma al di l delle tifoserie calcistiche sar in campidoglio a ricordare e onorare il presidente conclude aiuteremo rosella sensi e tutta las roma a costruire lo stadio della societ che penso non possa non essere intitolato proprio a franco sensi
5236795 credo di essere tra quelli che possono dire con cognizione di causa quanto profondo fosse lamore di sensi per la roma e per roma sono stato vicino da sindaco al presidente e alla sua famiglia in momenti difficili e l ho misurato quanto il suo amore per la sua squadra fosse capace di fargli considerare secondari persino i propri interessi personali
5236796 we are delighted to have secured the services of harry and terry you couldnt pick two better english managers to comment on the national side to have their valued insight and opinions for these crucial england games is a real coup for setanta and completes a first class presenting line up which im sure viewers will enjoy
5236797 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
5236798 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
5236799 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
5236800 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
5236801 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
5236802 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
5236803 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
5236804 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
5236805 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
5236806 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
5236807 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
5236808 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
5236809 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
5236810 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
5236811 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
5236812 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
5236813 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
5236814 i have to be careful because sometimes hell do a fast movement or run
5236815 but the other members arent as scared as i am
5236816 for someone to be putting money into a movie that goes out and defames us and puts us down you know that teaches society that hey we dont matter and thats crap we do matter
5236817 its just a movie you know there are worst movies out there to see
5236818 theres a fine line between whats funny and whats not
5236819 i hope someday they can forgive me for being such an idiot
5236820 it baffles me in a time of war that theres no one else to stop him
5236821 he saw a lot of things that he didnt care to go into detail about
5236822 he couldnt hear the fireworks go off at the fourth of july hed have nightmares about this and that
5236823 the clinic might not view alcohol addiction as the top priority
5236824 he told me that he told bach im at the end of my rope
5236825 he told me that too that he wanted to see somebody
5236826 my biggest issue is why wasnt the mental health care there
5236827 the behavioral health provider said they never should have canceled his appointment
5236828 you cant always predict the unpredictable usually youll call and see if we can reschedule
5236829 soldiers wont ask for help because they think im a macho guy and i can do it myself
5236830 the goal is to make someone successful in the job not push them out the door
5236831 i read through the records and i just remember crying all the way through
5236832 my god these people knew exactly what they were sending home to us
5236833 my job is to get the patients voice into the mix where decisions are made
5236834 no matter how psychotic that voice is still worthy of being heard i have not had the person who is so out of it that they cant communicate what they want
5236835 i dont know if they are doing people a service when they assert the right of mentally ill individuals to remain psychotic
5236836 there needs to be an external independent legally based advocacy system to make sure they are being treated fairly equitably and safely
5236837 they have a left wing individual rights at all costs agenda
5236838 our legal mandate is to protect the rights of individuals
5236839 you have disobeyed direct orders from a superior officer in the cia
5236840 dangerous to others without additional observation and active attempts to treat him
5236841 i repeatedly explained to the patient his advocates and other team members his paranoid psychosis will not likely improve without medication therapy
5236842 they want to see that you can play nicely in the community
5236843 was relying on the people whose purpose it was to ensure his civil rights were being exercised and unfortunately that interfered with his other right which was to get medical care
5236844 there is nothing in the william bruce case that is contrary to the way we do business
5236845 ive always had this horrible feeling that ive let you down in some way
5236846 the only wish i have is that someday we can look each other straight in the eyes and say im sorry and i love you more than life itself
5236847 they helped me immensely with getting out of the hospital so i was very happy
5236848 he stood by me the whole time despite the horrible tragedy despite what i did
5236849 i am the man i am today because of my dad
5236850 none of this would have happened if i had been medicated
5236851 not only are there cracks to fall through but we cant close them all
5236852 that would be wrong society has imposed some cracks i see cracks at every level is owning a gun a crack absolutely
5236853 within the military population you see a lot of denial and some families enable that
5236854 i dont think theyre any different than the rest of the population
5236855 forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us
5236856 ich wei schon was sie wollen das bekommen wir hin
5236857 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday
5236858 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5236859 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5236860 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5236861 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway

5236863 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5236864 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5236865 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5236866 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5236867 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5236868 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5236869 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5236870 if you lost to it that just means you are a noob
5236871 i am announcing now that iran is ready to launch satellites of friendly islamic countries into space
5236872 we are working on these satellites and gradually they will be put into orbit
5236873 there has been a deepening of uk pakistan relations we wish him mr musharraf well in the future
5236874 we support any measures which support democracy and the rule of law
5236875 i think it is the right thing for him to have done
5236876 i think it in no way detracts from the strong record he has as being a staunch ally of the west and its fight against islamic terrorism
5236877 i think the coalition government in pakistan now needs to focus on two issues the parlous economic state of the country and working with its allies to combat the ongoing threat of regional terrorism
5236878 this is next take penacilin sic now death to america death to israel allah is great
5236879 the loud little handful as usual will shout for the war
5236880 it is unjust and dishonorable and there is no necessity for it
5236881 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
5236882 i love her i think shes absolutely amazing but i thought she was amazing before she went out there im always going to feel that way
5236883 im just so happy that shes been able to do it
5236884 it was either him fly out here and spend the money on that or a holiday and we chose a holiday together

5236895 in leading up to this blog we have seen a lot of discussion in blogs about what microsoft might be trying to accomplish by maintaining a little bit more control over the communication around windows 7 some might say that this is a significant understatement
5236896 the number of patents now owned by graphon as a result of the nes acquisition has increased to twenty three a number that is expected to continue to increase as patent applications on file at the u s patent and trademark office mature into issued patents
5236897 aggressively protecting the technology represented in these patents is an important part of maximizing their value to graphon
5236898 i could get the information in a split second as opposed to digging around in the parts

5236914 9 exactly what i was thinking hence why i can totally see this as illegal especially for t
5236915 ive definitely written about that 1920s gps wristwatch before but im pretty sure the other stuff
5236916 looks pretty much like the roadmaps that they still use for rally style racing these days
5236917 i think the fact someone says they dont explode would be a perfect reason for getting a new one
5236918 yeah i emailed martijn about a price when i posted but hes apparently too busy hanging out with t
5236919 this year looks to be really exciting in terms of social media development especially since we offer a fully integrated and managed solution which means we work for agencies as well as directly for clients

5236922 it was 3am on thursday when i heard a bang then the man from room four shouted down saying somebody had been shooting at him through his window
5236923 there are six holes in the window really big holes so it was obviously a powerful rifle
5236924 we think the shots were fired from a car park across the road the a596
5236925 i rang them back at 10am and they said that theyd tried to call me but the phone was engaged
5236926 they promised to send somebody straight round nobodys been near
5236927 you could understand it if this had been a minor incident
5236928 im obviously appalled at the lack of police response to this serious incident any incident involving guns has to be considered serious and deserving of an emergency response
5236929 a lot of people are asking what we are getting back in return for the tax we pay
5236930 the officers said they knocked on doors and windows and there was no response
5236931 first teabag then water to the half of a mug wait 3 4 minutes add sugar or honey wait for a while then fill the mug up
5236932 depends on personal taste and the kind of tea but he most important thing is freshly drawn water freshly boiled needs oxygen
5236933 if using a tea bag then it goes first i like tea with just a little sugar real tea snobs wont use tea bags only leaves
5236934 first rince the pot with hot water second add tea 1 spoon person and a spoon for the pot third add boiling water no additives
5236935 teabag gt 2 sugars gt water gt brew for a bit gt teabag out gt milk gt enjoy
5236936 personally teabag gt add water gt stew 2 mins max and stir gt remove teabag gt add milk sugar as desired
5236937 im not an addict but fresh tea is prefered if teabag first the bag then the water and every addict would say without sweets
5236938 serial tea drinker here tea bag first followed by a little milk no sugar and i only add honey if i have a sore throat
5236939 i always find honey is superior to sugar in chai and rooibus

5236951 we have way too many homeless veterans and i dont feel that thats fair
5236952 we just need to start taking care of our own
5236953 if we just let them walk away and dont care if they learn or not then shame on us as adults
5236954 working families are just being squeezed very very hard and are finding it more difficult to just make ends meet
5236955 allows us to work on contaminated sites and turn them into reusable parcels where you can have employment and jobs without having to use sites that are pristine and can be preserved for open space
5236956 i would love to see health care and health insurance for every single child safe toys for every single child early success reading for every single child
5236957 we want to make sure that theres good programs that are available for our elderly theyve taken care of us all and now its time for us to take care of them
5236958 if youre healthy you should take your social security at your normal retirement age or later
5236959 if youre not healthy you should take your social security at age 62
5236960 we dont know where the next big breakthrough is going to be so we put money into many areas
5236961 certainly harvard is a key place you want to partner with
5236962 earnings estimate revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock prices
5236963 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5236964 they say that we want renewable energy but we dont want you to put it anywhere
5236965 weve seen more foreclosures than at any time since the great depression
5236966 over the last few decades revolutions in technology and communication have made it so that corporations can send good jobs wherever theres an internet connection
5236967 when a reckless few game the system as weve seen in this housing crisis millions suffer and were all affected
5236968 havent worked its time to leave them in the past where they belong its time for something new
5236969 the soldiers told us they had an order from putin leave or be killed
5236970 they said putin has given us an order that everyone must be either shot or forced to leave they told us we should ask the americans for help now because they would kill us if we stayed
5236971 we didnt have any guns so he shot georgi in front of me without saying a word
5236972 a neighbour helped me to bury him in our garden and then i just fled
5236973 if they are not staying here why did they blow up our tv centre and bring their transmitters to broadcast their own tv and radio it looks very suspicious
5236974 it is a matter of fact that they have expanded geographically since yesterday
5236975 we feel legally bound to the commitment to cease fire that we have made but it looks like they dont feel committed to this agreement after the ceasefire they exploded the bridge and went deeper into our territory they have cut the country in two
5236976 we have two options either we attack them to get into the city or obey the rules that they impose they say that the moment they see any georgian police cars in the city they will shoot
5236977 they organise lines and tell us to come at a particular time but then they have nothing to give us there are men walking away with aid boxes and we get nothing they are also coming to peoples homes and looking for humanitarian aid to take back so that they can start selling it on the streets
5236978 have returned to washington to demand that speaker pelosi bring congress back into session so we can have an up or down vote on a truly comprehensive pro american pro production energy strategy that eases the pain at the pump and lessens our dependence on foreign oil
5236979 i actually just looked at it for a while i just held it there and i laid it across my bed and i just stared at it for a few minutes just because as a kid growing up this is the ultimate ultimate in basketball
5236980 is that a cool thing to say in this day and age that you love your country and that youre fighting for the red white and blue it seems sort of like a day gone by
5236981 no its a cool thing for me to say i feel great about it and im not ashamed to say it i mean this is a tremendous honor
5236982 when i hear obama i think yeah mccain comes across as a grouchy old man but the contrast on the issues eventually becomes clear
5236983 but mccain was clear on issues like life he said life begins at conception thats my position he believes what i believe i like obama but ill be voting for mccain
5236984 weve had a republican and i have moments when i approve and moments when i dont approve
5236985 the more conservative element of the christian population is slowly coming to grips with what an obama presidency might be like
5236986 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5236987 now you want to win and saying it doesnt make it so
5236988 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working
5236989 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen why are we having to run all these television commercials why do we have to raise all this money just read the papers these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple
5236990 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5236991 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5236992 now you want to win and saying it doesnt make it so
5236993 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working
5236994 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen why are we having to run all these television commercials why do we have to raise all this money just read the papers these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple
5236995 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5236996 theyve got a book about me that just kind of sprung full bore out of this guys head
5236997 john mccain all he wants to do is talk about me they know they cant win on the issues so what theyll do is theyll try to scare people hes risky hes risky were not sure
5236998 geez im not really sure how well i will do
5236999 if we have to fight al queda and the russians this is not the guy we need in the white house
5237000 hell be lucky to win the nomination over hillary if we have to fight al queda and the russians
5237001 i will win because i plan to cheat like i did in the primary
5237002 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5237003 this election is about whether or not we are going to sustain and maintain the american dream for the next generation
5237004 the wealthiest 1 percent have never had it so good but ordinary families middle class families saw their incomes go down by 1 000
5237005 an economy thats working not just for some but for all
5237006 your story was my story because i wasnt born into fame or fortune
5237007 people out here are not internet people and they work long days doing blue collar jobs
5237008 he needs to get out there and tell them the american worker deserves a shot because they dont watch cable news
5237009 go over there to that door and wait while i just put conker into her stable i shall be back in a trice
5237010 you are very welcome my dear you shall dine with us and we shall share stories on this dark and stormy night then you shall inform us of how we may assist you you will be our guest of honour and we shall provide all that you require
5237011 come with me my dear and lets see if we cant find you something
5237012 something more comfortable to wear for supper and a room for you to sleep in
5237013 try that on for size it should fit you well when youre ready come back and join us
5237014 you must be starving grab something from the side board over there take anything you want the others have had their breakfast so you can eat whats left
5237015 i am so sorry i missed supper one minute i was awake and the next minute i was unconscious i didnt mean to fall asleep i promise
5237016 not a problem we were all looking forward to hearing your story though and were left quite disappointed
5237017 lady genette went to check on you and found you snoring like a hibernating bear so we werent worried
5237018 you have all been very kind im not sure i would have survived the storm out there last night even in the shelter of the stall i need to get going again today but i think i needed to meet you two i have been told that two knights will help me and if you had not come along when you did i would have passed by without having found you
5237019 oh yes i believe you i was shown in a dream that i would meet you and that it wasnt the sticks you needed help with but some other mysterious task pray tell me a little about your mission if you can although i dont want you to feel obliged
5237020 she is waiting for me to travel to her birth time to retrieve her contract there is a problem ive been told and someone may try to hinder me but there is a woman in the city of the martyr who has some information that i need
5237021 how is it exactly that we can help you young lady what do you wish that we do for you
5237022 please call me brieze i have to cross the river of sticks and go to the city of the martyr could you show me the way
5237023 are you sure thats what you want to do and are you sure it is we who should help you
5237024 then we will go straight to lord windharpe and ask to be relieved of our duties here and see if he has any advice on our proceeding meet us back here in an hour
5237025 for july 2008 the wandering tax pro is 52 in the sitemeter rankings the only other tax blog on the lost is
5237026 we want to make as much information available as possible to help consumers make well informed choices
5237027 this is one tool that they should use but it shouldnt take the place of an on site visit
5237028 we are out of the cone but we still have tropical storm watches up and people should be aware of that
5237029 they should be aware that impacts can be broader than where the storm track indicates
5237030 and i also have my booze and five cans of spam
5237031 those who study the vedas and drink the soma juice seeking the heavenly planets worship me indirectly purified of sinful reactions they take birth on the pious heavenly planet of indra where they enjoy godly delights
5237032 when they have thus enjoyed vast heavenly sense pleasure and the results of their pious activities are exhausted they return to this mortal planet again
5237033 but those who always worship me with exclusive devotion meditating on my transcendental form to them i carry what they lack and i preserve what they have
5237034 those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship only me o son of kunti but they do so in a wrong way
5237035 i am the only enjoyer and master of all sacrifices therefore those who do not recognize my true transcendental nature fall down
5237036 i dont happen to agree with everything either of the candidates teach or believe but they both care deeply about america theyre both patriots and they have very different views on how our nation can be strengthened weve got to learn to disagree without demonizing each other and we need to restore civility in our civil discourse and thats the goal of the saddleback civil forum
5237037 obama gave a very long answer to the question and did so by not saying anything hes also got the abortion numbers wrong within that as well as using old numbers you know that hillary clinton had debunked a year ago
5237038 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights
5237039 i am pro choice because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually rather they wrestle with these things in profound ways
5237040 at the moment of conception i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5237041 john mccain without hesitation bang life begins at conception he gets it the judges that he would appoint he made it very very clear i think he also resonated with beyond the base to those who are pro life even within the democratic party i think it was exactly what needed to be done he said it exactly the way it needed to be said
5237042 senator mccain helped himself he just will not shake loose of his beliefs that hes held for a long time on favoring research on embryonic stem cells but as soon as tonight he hastened to the safer ground of the promise of adult stem cells as producing progress and disease research so he knows that hes on thin ice with that but on the larger pro life issue hes certainly presented himself quite properly as strongly pro life so that was a good step for him
5237043 i think that senator mccain closed the deal i think he made a clear contract between himself and barack obama many evangelicals will vote for him
5237044 i think the distinction that we heard tonight was clear was decisive was effective that would be muddied if he mixes the ticket in some way and gets somebody who could become the president in the event that something terrible would happen to mccain who would go contrary to the clarity the focus and the energy with which mccain came forth tonight
5237045 obama says he supports marriage between a man and a woman but of course he says he opposed the marriage amendment in california do you see some conflict there
5237046 you cannot square the circle as he is trying to do either you support marriage or you do not he says one thing by his actions he indicates another thing and that answer shows up the hypocrisy in his position on that issue
5237047 i think it would be more refreshing for him if he would just be honest about it and say he favors gay marriage
5237048 he cannot do that because the american people do not favor gay marriage and so he needs to keep twisting and turning diving on that issue and it is hypocritical
5237049 he said that he would not only support he would support states definitions of marriage the defense in his own state of arizona for example where he has been stalwart leader for marriage as a union between one man and one woman but he also made it very clear heres the distinction what john mccain said tonight is his position that he says that the supreme court of california was wrong
5237050 what barack obama left out tonight is that he actually publicly praised the supreme court of california
5237051 answers were sharp i think he has thought a whole lot more about leadership i was particularly impressed by his answer on people he admired he went right to general petraeus who did one of the most remarkable military campaigns in recent memory and i contrast that to senator obama who when asked who influences him the most he mentioned his wife he mentioned his grandmother those are safe nominations
5237052 will in any case be reviewed because nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffers statement that russia used disproportionate force to protect its citizens that we acted beyond the limits of self defence is utterly intolerable
5237053 these are not credible allegations especially coming from the head of an organisation like nato which has itself used not just disproportionate force but force against civilian targets and the civilian population especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999 mr rogozin added
5237054 will in any case be reviewed because nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffers statement that russia used disproportionate force to protect its citizens that we acted beyond the limits of self defence is utterly intolerable
5237055 mr greenwood youre violating a subdivision rule that prohibits pickup trucks in your driveway

5237166 that the courts in this country had been making efforts to widen the scope of the meaning given to the word
5237167 the issue in the action under consideration does not refer to a document generated through a computer as in the case of benwell vs republic of sri lanka
5237168 the question to be decided in this instance could easily be distinguished from the judgment by justice collin thome
5237169 this court is inclined to follow the decisions pronounced in the aforesaid cases namely abubaker vs queen and in re s a wickramasinghe thus it is my opinion that the message received on the screen of a mobile phone which had been typed by another person from a different point and was sent with the assistance of technology could be admitted in evidence in the circumstances i decide that the original message received by a mobile phone should be considered as admissible evidence in terms of the provisions of the evidence ordinance of 1895

5237171 it is my opinion that a short message commonly described as sms falls within the scope of the electronic transaction act and therefore the evidence sought to be produced by the plaintiff could easily be admitted in evidence under section 21 of the said act no 19 of 2006
5237172 the learned counsel for the defendant has argued that the provisions of the electronic transaction act cannot be invoked in this instance since the alleged sms messages were not compiled or received in the course of business trade or profession or other regularly conducted activity
5237173 not inclined to accept this argument since the sole basis of this action depended upon an agreement which is purely in the nature of a commercial activity moreover the sms messages in question had been exchanged between the parties whilst acting under the terms and conditions contained in the said business agreement
5237174 notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the evidence ordinance or any other written law the following provisions of this section shall be applicable for the purposes of this act
5237175 basis on which i have relied upon the provisions of the evidence ordinance purely depends on the interpretation given to the

5237183 what we believe hoffe must have is the diary he kept from the day he arrived in tel aviv in 1939 filled with observations for researchers it would be very significant
5237184 brod became a zionist before the first world war lived and worked here and is buried here less well known is the fact that kafka was a totally engaged jewish personality and writer with many intimate connections to zionism and jews

5237216 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5237217 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis
5237218 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5237219 the stb should be a simple cheap bridging mechanism which allows us to see the new channels until we buy digital tv sets in time
5237220 an stb can be bought for as little as 10 pounds in the uk each frequency which on analogue carries only one tv channel can be multiplexed into at least eight separate tv channels thanks to digitisation and more choice in television is all that people want
5237221 but governments newly adopted policy is to set specifications for an expensive stb to bridge nothing less than the digital divide
5237222 it is probably the last thing south africans want to go home to after a day battling with the effects of actual government
5237223 the cabinet approved policy in favour of the r700 stb now thankfully passes into the hands of the sa bureau of standards and the independent communications authority of sa
5237224 it is also unforgivable that the director general lyndall shope mafole on sunday said that all government had promised was the switch on of digital signals by november 2008 what use are signals if there are no programmes broadcast over them and no boxes to convert the signals for old sets the broadcasters will save the day and do what government should be doing encouraging the uptake of more choice in tv

5237255 die soziale vernetzung des internet wird mehr und mehr zur realit t und unternehmen sind gut beraten sich den damit verbundenen neuen m glichkeiten des dialogs zu den f r sie relevanten teil ffentlichkeiten zu ffnen
5237256 unternehmen erhalten die m glichkeit sich via blogging direkt mit ihren kunden auszutauschen und dar ber ihre glaubw rdigkeit zu st rken schlie lich erleben kunden nicht mehr nur eine fassade sondern ein ganzes virtuelles haus in das man sich hineinbewegen kann um gespr che mit mitarbeitern zu f hren
5237257 blogs bieten die m glichkeit authentischer zu kommunizieren ein risiko besteht darin dass die besucher die blog etikette missachten und dadurch keine respektvolle kommunikation m glich ist
5237258 das ist ein blog ein echter nat rlich daher kann es kein marketing gag sein und hat mit schleichwerbung nichts zu tun
5237259 wir kennen das ungeschriebene gesetz der blogosph re dass werbung in blog texten absolut nix verloren hat dem haben wir ebenso nix hinzuzuf gen
5237260 soziale netzwerke funktionieren vor allem ber den dialog es ist mindestens genauso wichtig sich f r andere zu interessieren

5237269 fast forward almost a year and the mccain campaign has begun to implement some of the same tactics
5237270 i think it shows the campaign is willing to play with the technology and enable their supporters to participate in that flurry of web activity a little supporter participation can go a long way towards feeding energy into a campaign

5237612 people think that he is unprofessional and a bad team mate as if he were some sort of time bomb waiting to explode in the dressing room but he is nothing of the sort he is an example of professionalism
5237613 he knows he has made a lot of mistakes but he surprises me with the enthusiasm and sacrifice he makes in every game he wants to be the best and he is
5237614 rijkaard believes in self regulation but that is almost impossible in a team like barcelona where the players earn a lot of money and win a lot of trophies
5237615 in all collective activities there has to be order and discipline and that is what guardiola has imposed as a coach he knows what he wants and he has got some very clear ideas

5237623 der drastische nachfrageabschwung nach lcd panels ist nicht unn tigerweise eine schlechte sache f r die industrie da dies m glicherweise zu einer fr her als zu erwartenden knappheit am markt 2009 f hren k nnte
5237624 generell sehen auch wir eine marktberuhigung dies hat speziell f r europa auch damit zu tun dass die konjunktur schw chelt die internationale funkausstellung kurz bevorsteht und sich kunden zum jetzigen zeitpunkt mit neuanschaffungen eher zur ckhalten
5237625 denn die markenhersteller werden so marktanteilsverluste gegen ber billiganbietern und handelsmarken ausgleichen wollen andererseits kann es wie erfolgsbeispiele zeigen durch eine ver nderte preiskommunikation oder neue preismodelle gelingen ohne reale preissenkungen dem trend zu folgen
5237626 im detail muss jedoch beachtet werden dass die verbraucher auch weiterhin qualit tsvergleiche anstellen
5237627 daraus folgt dass die verbraucher zum beispiel bei als mangelhaft wahrgenommener qualit t nicht unbedingt zu discountern wechseln sondern eventuell ganz auf den kauf verzichten oder diesen zeitlich verschieben
5237628 auch die lufthansa zeigt dass erfolg im wettbewerb mit billiganbietern m glich ist verbraucher honorieren es sofort wenn die richtigen tasten auf der marketing klaviatur gegriffen werden und die zielgruppenbezogene preiskommunikation stimmt

5237636 a broad coalition of wall street firms from banks and insurers to hedge funds and private equity firms are pushing lawmakers to let them buy and manage so called frozen corporate pension plans which no longer accept new members but must continue to cover current ones of the 2 3 trillion in u s corporate pension fund assets some 500 billion sits in frozen plans including those of big companies such as ibm hewlett packard verizon and alcoa
5237637 jpmorgans newest property bear stearns was among the first to lobby congress and regulators it started last year just as two of its hedge funds were imploding
5237638 mckinsey amp co predicts that the assets in frozen plans will more than triple to 1 7 trillion by 2012 by taking over frozen plans wall street firms could charge fees based on the total assets perhaps in line with the standard 1 to 2 levied by many money managers

5237663 it doesnt really matter who gets in the new president is in for a very hard time it doesnt take too many more hundreds of billions in bailouts to be more than the taxpayers can handle

5237665 obama is a great talker but can he lead congress into the right moves to salvage the economy
5237666 no matter who wins the november election the economy will not improve overnight
5237667 we must find a way for the national government as well as state and local government to cut out the wasteful spending bring jobs back to america and find alternative energy sources
5237668 i do not like the war stance of mccain but have economic issues with more government programs and other democrat obama economics
5237669 more government in our lives and erode freedoms plus we know what happens to programs run by the government
5237670 it appears that the past eight years have resulted in one of the worst economies in decades the highest deficit severely damaged international reputation and the lowest support for womens rights since the 1970s
5237671 a positive but short lived effect on our countrys economy
5237672 i have been a grocery shopper for 50 years and i am dismayed at how much prices are rising
5237673 something must be done and soon and i am not sure a new president is the answer i keep listening to mccain and obamas plans to help our economy but wonder just how much they can do
5237674 the meeting was an effort to get feedback from neighbors
5237675 it was an effort to get input on our plan in a collaborative manner
5237676 it is important that we try to address the concerns of our neighbors the community and the town of summerfield the meeting on the 31st was the first step in that process
5237677 just how many grocery stores do we need in this area anyway
5237678 we already have a walgreens going up 100 yards from a cvs with a food lion behind it i thought this was summerfield not wendover avenue
5237679 if it were flat i would be much less concerned but that septic field slopes downward and could seep into the water systems it just doesnt stand to reason that that would work
5237680 the developer said they did a traffic study and this development wouldnt impact traffic by more than about two seconds
5237681 we are clearly taking those comments seriously thats really the stage were in now with the planning process
5237682 i just want to clean the place up and make it look like a shopping center instead of a hitching post
5237683 we are expecting a response from dot prior to the scheduled public hearing
5237684 our concern is that this is in strong contrast to what was recommended to us
5237685 its important that responsible development be applied you can get the golden egg and kill the goose that laid it in the process we want to make sure that beautiful northwest guilford county is preserved
5237686 traffic is already a big issue on 68 edgefield and pleasant ridge roads plus were worried about northwest schools already being overcrowded and clear cutting of trees to build
5237687 our hope is to have the area treated like oak ridge rather than treated like high point
5237688 why do they need to develop more in our area when there is already plenty of space available elsewhere all within minutes of the airport
5237689 what we felt were compromise conditions they really didnt meet any of them except what they would have had to meet anyway we are extremely disappointed with their lack of earnest compromise
5237690 what happens here will set the bar on what happens in this area in the next few years
5237691 although i am very pleased to hear him listening to those around him i saw several quotes from school board members and parents who praised him for saying i dont know and not having a ready made plan
5237692 personally im all for a ready made plan that includes giving back more power to teachers and principals incorporating the community in the schools finding ulterior means for educating students more interested in disrupting schools than planning for their future preventing and not merely handling violence in schools and bringing back skill classes like shop keyboarding and home ec for students not on a traditional college track
5237693 while it was nice to hear that mr green didnt think he had all the answers i would have been more confident if he had a firm vision of direction for guilford county schools
5237694 hopefully this will come after his 100 days of listening mr green will have to stand up and be a leader and hold people accountable
5237695 i think his lack of specifics and plans may be his greatest strength
5237696 mr greens biggest challenge will be to overcome the morale and intimidation issues and the lack of trust that the grier years have heaped upon our teachers

5237852 as you are aware dezan shira amp associates deals exclusively with foreign direct investment into china
5237853 so we are in a good position to judge capital flows into china from overseas despite the talk of a slowdown all i can point to is the fact that july just before the olympics and in the middle of all the visa issues was our biggest billing china month 2008 to date while our mid month figures for china for august are at an all time high sure we are conducting more overseas telephone conferences with investors particularly from the united states than is normal but the interest in china and commitment to investment here remains strong and as far as we can see is likely to remain so we predict a very busy final quarter for china this year and expect growth in expect of 40 percent over that of last year

5237855 in 1999 everybody was saying that come 2005 we should be moving towards a range of commercial tidal and wave devices that time has gone and among the things that have held up progress has been a huge emphasis on wind some of the inertia has been evident from westminster compared to the scottish government there is a dearth of funding in wave and tidal power
5237856 it takes modern engineering capabilities to come up with solutions marine power subsidies are not as generous as they should be
5237857 we dont have a wind industry because in the early days of wind turbine development it wasnt taken seriously by government
5237858 marine power should be getting a different flavour of subsidies because the wind people are now building in such quantity they are getting their price reduction
5237859 if we just go on the way we are nobody will do anything except wind i think there are still people around who dont want it to work and who want to go to nuclear
5237860 wave and tidal power could be key for sustainable uk electricity generation in the long term and provide huge commercial opportunities we want to lead the way and thats why we are undertaking a feasibility study on whether to support a barrage or another project to exploit the tidal power of the severn estuary

5237872 average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5 and 10 so a 30 loss is deeply worrying this spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers
5237873 we dont know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality
5237874 30 fewer honeybee colonies could therefore cost the economy some 50m and put at risk the governments crusade for the public to eat five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day

5237974 termasuk gambar bekas pacarku yang sudah jadi teman baik bahkan sering bersilaturahmi ke rumah itu adalah kezaliman pengaruh dari berbagai aksi berbagai organisasi yang kini seenaknya saja main hakim sendiri mentang mentang tidak pernah ditindak tegas
5237975 ibu hanya mengatakan coba ami bersihkan segala meja almari dan rak buku dari sampah sampah tidak penting yang disimpan bapakmu kalau tidak rumah akan jadi keranjang sampah kata ibu lalu ami menyortir mana yang harus dibakar dibuang diberikan tetangga dan mana yang boleh disimpan
5237976 bukan itu inisiatip ami sendiri sebelum ibu melihatnya sendiri lebih baik ami bakar bapak mestinya berterimakmasih sebab ami sudah menyelamatkan coba tidak ibu akan lihat semua satu foto saja sudah bisa bikin ibu kena serangan jantung apalagi beberapa foto
5237977 apalagi 120 ibu bisa langsung angkat kopor pulang ke kampung
5237978 bapak boleh berkata begitu tapi ibu coba bayangkan sekarang kalau bapak menemukan foto laki laki lain di dompet ibu apa bapak tidak curiga
5237979 tapi jangan langsung gebrak main bakar bapak akan tanya baik baik kenapa foto itu di simpan kalau alasannya masuk akal kenapa harus marah
5237980 ya marah juga masak istri menyimpan foto lelaki lain poliandri itu namanya dilarang undang undang tidak bisa
5237981 poligami tidak dilarang tapi bapak juga anti poligami ibu kamu tahu itu jadi tidak perlu pakai main bakar bakaran praktek kekerasan itu bertentangan dengan hakekat rumah tangga yang harus saling cinta mencintai
5237982 nah itu sama dengan ibu di dalam rumah hanya ada satu suami dan satu istri
5237983 lho ibu tidak melakukan kekerasan itu ami yang melakukannya ibu malah tidak tahu
5237984 bukan itu inisiatip ami jadi kalau bapak mau marah marah sama ami saja jangan marah sama ibu
5237985 kalau kamu membakar tapi ibu kamu tidak melarang artinya dia menyetujui dan kalau dia menyetujui berarti dia memang meniatkan dan merencanakan
5237986 ibu pasti marah juga kalau tahu ami sudah membakar membuang dan memberikan kepada tetangga koleksi bapak padahal ibu hanya menyuruh membersihkan rumah dari sampah begitu jadi bapak lebih baik pulang sekarang ibu sudah selesai masak mau pulang tidak atau mau berantem terus
5237987 jangan diam saja kalau ada apa apa dibicarakan jangan main bakar seperti kejadian di jakarta berbeda pendapat itu kan normal jangan langsung main kekerasan
5237988 itu foto foto lama kenapa dibakar itu kan hanya dokumentasi
5237989 itu foto dik nelly dan dik pertiwi kok dibakar kan ibu juga berteman baik dengan dia
5237990 sebab di dalam rumah tangga hanya boleh ada satu suami dan satu istri
5237991 salah bukan begitu caranya melindungi dan membela ibu kalau betul mau melindungi ibu ada cara yang lebih baik
5237992 lebih baik ibu bersaing dengan foto karena foto tetap saja foto daripada bersaing dengan orangnya jadi ayo kembalikan foto foto koleksi bapakmu itu sekarang juga di mana kamu simpan belum dibakar kan kembalikan kalau tidak ibu marah
5237993 tak usah terlalu melebih lebihkan semangat perjuangan bapak di masa lalu itu sekarang masa orang lebih memperjuangkan kepentingan diri sendiri dan golongan kalau tidak hati hati bisa bisa kita digilas
5237994 memang aku juga tidak sungguh sungguh mau membersihkan jalan jalan itu dari bendera partai karena walau pun kota diamuk oleh bendera bendera partai menjadi lautan politik tetapi semangat kebangsaan di dalam paling sedikit jiwaku tidak akan pernah padam bahkan justru tambah menggebu gebu sekaranglah di saat orang sudah lupa pada kepentingan bersama perasaan berkorbanku untuk kebersamaan semakin berkobar jadi aku justru berterimakasih pada bendera bendera itu karena membuat aku semakin cinta pada tanah air sementara banyak orang kian bejat
5237995 habis katanya bapak dulu marah sebab kegairahan mengibarkan bendera merah putih kalah dengan jor joran pengibaran gendera partai politik
5237996 bapak tidak lihat bendera yang dikibarkan rumah bertingkat tiga milik orang kaya itu
5237997 terimakmasih saya tidak bermaksud untuk mengganggu ketenangan bapak bertamu malam malam begini tetapi hanya mau bertanya
5237998 ini bukan protes bukan juga kritik saya tidak mau mengganggu kebebasan bapak sebab kita hidup di alam demokrasi dan kita sama sama mengerti apa arti kemerdekaan
5237999 saya tidak bermaksud untuk merecoki tapi hanya sekedar bertanya saja sama sekali bukjan menyindir kalau pertanyaan saya tidak dijawab pun saya mengerti karena itu bagian dari kemerdekaan saya hanya tidak bisa menahan diri saya untuk bertanya boleh
5238000 kenapa mesti tersinggung kan pak amat tadi bilang hanya bertanya
5238001 persis hanya sekedar bertanya saya penasaran saja ingin tahu apa sebenarnya motivasi atau tujuan atau jangan jangan karena ketidaksengajaan siapa tahu bapak sendiri juga kurang periksa betul tidak
5238002 pak amay begini saya sebenarnyta sejak awal sudah khawatir kalau akan terjadi apa apa tetapi karena waktunya semakin mendesak momentumnya nanti bisa hilang saya terpaksa memberanikan diri saja untuk bertindak tetapi pak amat harap mengerti segbenarnya sama sekali tidak ada maksud apa apa tidak ada motivasi apa apa semuanya saya lakukan dengan ikhlas dan jujur
5238003 betul pak amat saya lihat komunitas kita ini dihuni oleh semua orang yang sopan sopan dan baik sayang sekali kalau kita membiarkan masyarakat menyekolahkan anak anaknya jauh biarlah kita dirikan bukan saja tk dan sd tapi juga smp dan sma bahkan kalau disetujui nanti juga akademi kejuruan karena itu saya beranikan untuk menyumbang 5 milyar agar pembangunan sekolah itu bisa diteruskan daripada nanti hambruk karena sudah 3 tahun terbengkalai jadi begitu tak ada maksud apa apa sama sekali tak ada keinginan saya untuk menguasai atau menyinggung warga semuanya yang sudah begitu baik menerima saya sebagai anggota di sini begitu pak amat

5238012 when i look back into the african culture i begin to see some semblance of culture playing visible role in this unfortunate involvement we belong to a culture where women and the girl child play subservient roles the branding of women and girls as commodities for sex trade is predicated on gender and gender roles ascribed to them by the society the gender roles ascribed to them predispose them to human trafficking
5238013 we must put away the get rich quick syndrome that has bedeviled the society our vision should be the attainment of zero tolerance to human trafficking and i believe with strong will total dedication absolute commitment and unity in action we can do it
5238014 it is pertinent to mention that due to the complexity of the issue of trafficking in persons reducing the issue to mere definitions will not suffice however definitions are useful in defining the scope of the problem in setting expectations for action and gathering reliable data among other things it is therefore very important that the community understands the definition and scope of the issue of tip trafficking in persons

5238088 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5238089 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5238090 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5238091 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5238092 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5238093 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5238094 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5238095 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5238096 every day every second we will be thinking of him
5238097 he was a helpful boy he was very family orientated
5238098 he was energetic always giving a helping hand whenever it was needed

5238115 the sleek looking one that writes so nicely not seen it its probably in your bag
5238116 as a result of the discussions that have been going on we can today announce an initiative for professional cycling that has been agreed by the amaury group
5238117 haimar is a perfect addition for our team hes a good time trialist can climb very well and will be an excellent all around teammate in the grand tours a rider like haimar who has finished in the top ten in numerous grand tours also has the ability to win some stages and races he may be a veteran but i think he has an exciting two years ahead of him with team astana
5238118 the astana team is the best stage racing team in the world ive always admired johan bruyneels teams and to race for him and the best riders is a special honor i am thankful for the past eleven years but im also excited for the new opportunities and challenges that lie ahead
5238119 it definitely helped being here in july because i did that race in all the wrong gears i put on some special stuff for this race
5238120 although most of our riders are under contract until december 31 2008 and we are not obligated to release them prior to this date we have decided that even though we think we will have a new sponsor signed by the end of november for continental team status in 2009 we do not want to put the riders in a position of not being able to obtain employment in the event our sponsorship contract is not ultimately signed leaving the riders in a bad spot
5238121 its truly a pity that we were not able to get a contract signed in time to keep our family together going forward even though we have a couple of sponsors who can potentially sign in the coming months
5238122 in any other industry this rule would qualify as age discrimination but not in the world of cycling where a team cannot race without a uci approved team license governed exclusively by uci rules and issued by each countries home cycling federation who are required to enforce such rules today i was forced to tell my riders that although i have money burning a hole in my pocket to support the team and we have contractual commitments from many of our current sponsors for 2009 we cannot give them a job because they are either too old or we dont have enough time to sign our new sponsor by the imposed uci deadline to become either a continental or pro continental team in 2009
5238123 you can make these up to one week in advance
5238124 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5238125 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5238126 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5238127 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5238128 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5238129 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5238130 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5238131 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars
5238132 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5238133 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5238134 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5238135 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5238136 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5238137 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5238138 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5238145 firefighter scott mcphee volunteered to climb the ladder and rescue the cat
5238146 he grabbed it by the neck and carried it down but before he got to the bottom the cat jumped down and ran away
5238147 when i arrived it was sitting perched on top of the pole doing a balancing act
5238148 but it seemed quite happy it was just looking around and surveying its kingdom
5238149 there was no way we could get it down so we called the fire service the cat was uninjured we assume it headed straight home
5238150 it sickens me that anyone would want to do this and ive met frank and told him so

5238171 ive had such a great season training had gone well and i was hoping for a medal but it just wasnt my day im not making excuses but being injured for much of the last couple of years meant i had to race a lot just to get here perhaps it was one race too many

5238190 we have a responsibility to do something to show the world that tibet needs to be free
5238191 we really appreciate his support and the risk and trouble he took
5238192 he was able to show the spotlight about what is going on in tibet right now and how the tibetans are suffering
5238193 to prevent potentially embarrassing protests inside tibet china has turned large parts of tibet into a virtual prison for the duration of the games
5238194 many should feel ashamed of their groundless accusations once they know what the chinese government has done for ethnic minorities

5238208 when you lead that sort of life you have to understand that when your level drops then the knives will be out he is like that he likes going out and enjoying life

5238210 he has his own private life that should not be interfered with but it is true that that private life also affects his sporting performances
5238211 ronie went from being an idol for all barcelona fans to being jeered and criticised and that hurts anyone
5238212 people think that he is unprofessional and a bad team mate as if he were some sort of time bomb waiting to explode in the dressing room but he is nothing of the sort he is an example of professionalism
5238213 he knows he has made a lot of mistakes but he surprises me with the enthusiasm and sacrifice he makes in every game he wants to be the best and he is
5238214 rijkaard believes in self regulation but that is almost impossible in a team like barcelona where the players earn a lot of money and win a lot of trophies

5238240 it could very well be argued that non listed companies do not always benefit from the spill over effect of the application of disproportionate governance rules

5238249 create a dynamic and sustainable network of business practices and advice tailored to the needs of non listed companies
5238250 the one size fits all and regulatory mentality arguably led to some undesirable spill over effects to non listed companies
5238251 sufficiently attractive and coherent from a cost benefit perspective to persuade non listed companies to opt into a well tailored framework of legal mechanisms and norms
5238252 well designed and effective governance structures are likely to perform better and consequently will be more attractive to external investors
5238253 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday

5238256 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5238257 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5238258 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems

5238278 the afghans did not go to canada to kill the canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghan
5238279 therefore you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5238280 but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children events such as logar will happen again

5238295 americans regard democracy as something more transcendent something more sacred than just counting noses

5238347 alanna got her period had trouble with boys stuff that happened to me even if i wasnt a knight in training
5238348 stop it james you have no idea what its like to have a cold
5238349 i had a cold last week i cant think properly
5238350 i know you cant help it but thanks for being my sister no i really mean it youre heaps cool youre really cool and youre the coolest sister ever and youre not a skank i dont like skanks but youre not like that youre cool and i love you
5238351 it might be spectacularly good or spectacularly bad but theyre going to go for it
5238352 karen is going to play it safe because she can probably get a medal playing it safe
5238353 she already does one of the most difficult routines and she has the most consistent height maintenance and style so she doesnt need to take a risk
5238354 that wasnt a planned routine we pretty much took my final routine which i plan to compete on the 19th and adjusted it a little bit and came up with something completely new
5238355 you have to do what you have to do no final is nearly as important as this one
5238356 i can throw down a big routine and get a big score and hopefully shake up some of the other competitors
5238357 you look at shanshan who has a total shot at the gold medal and now shes not even in the final
5238358 that could be you the prelims are nerve wracking because if you dont make it you dont even have a shot
5238359 once youre in there its like this is it im just going to go out and see where the cards fall but if you dont get into that round its pretty disappointing
5238360 rosie said after her first routine i didnt realize i was going to get so damn nervous
5238361 the doctors told me that lauren has broken her left arm
5238362 a girl in front of her crashed on the bike and lauren couldnt avoid it
5238363 i was prepared for the heat in the run and bike but not the water which was really warm and that told the day for me
5238364 it was tough but this is the olympics and it is supposed to be tough
5238365 i think thats why the feeling of accomplishment must be so much greater for those who are on the podium today
5238366 when we arrived and news came that gori was being shelled i saw my footage i said thats not gori thats tskhinvali having crawled through the length and breadth of tskhinvali i dont need much to tell from which point this or that footage was recorded i can swear in front of any tribunal i can point at this location on the map of the town because i and the cameraman of the rossiya channel videotaped that
5238367 this was the first chance to put my best effort forward just to see what i could do
5238368 not making it out of the heats thats just ridiculous
5238369 i couldnt really get out of my bed until two days ago it was just a lack of energy my body was just completely fatigued it hurt to touch it hurt to lay down it hurt to do everything
5238370 i thought i was over it but it seems like it still has taken a lot out of my body
5238371 i got to one slow constant speed couldnt pick it up from there
5238372 theres a physical and mental component to performing and i think the flu was just another response to his immune system that has been down because of the pressure
5238373 its been displaying itself in various mechanisms problems with his breathing heavy legs illness
5238374 but this is his first olympics and this is how he responded to it
5238375 hes never responded like this now its going to be about taking some time away think about whats important and see how hell respond to this a lot of top athletes have bottomed out before theyve made it to the top and maybe this is what he needs to happen
5238376 right now hes sad hes concerned that hes let us down but i dont feel that way at all
5238377 ill get over it and assess what i want to do and get on with the next race theres a lot of good people that arent going to make the finals or dont get out of the heats it happens to a select few it just happens this year that im one of them
5238378 the crowd it felt like it was on top of you in any other venue that same run might have been 20 90 but just because it was in the olympics in front of that crowd it was 20 60
5238379 i dont think it was serious but i didnt want to go and risk any more damage turn a strain into a pull because i felt a little discomfort coming around the corner there so i just eased up
5238380 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
5238381 i guess its a lucky number for me now too
5238382 seeing eight in 08 and opening ceremonies starting at 8 08 i guess it was maybe meant to be
5238383 oh man i feel i can just taste it now
5238384 we really thought we had a good chance to have at least one guy in that final
5238385 i didnt feel my trigger shaking but i guess it was
5238386 it just hit the trigger the gun went off and i was like
5238387 its been four long years of heartache that weve had to relive over and over
5238388 for us to go home with a silver medal is truly an honor
5238389 i just stayed calm and had a great time out there

5238407 it was good physical work good hard work but we were well fed and well cared for
5238408 young professionals across the nation conservation professionals park professionals have really stepped forward to honor the guys
5238409 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week
5238410 so we needed food on the table there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food
5238411 they need it today it would be wonderful today if they had it and got the kids off the street and into a camp like that work hard and earn money and learn what life is all about
5238412 it will be interesting to see the segmental breakdown though to see how the various divisions have withstood the consumer spending downturn
5238413 we have to see through this difficult period to fully appreciate how clever the strategy is
5238414 trading conditions have deteriorated substantially with a further decline in consumer spending as a result of interest rate hikes and increases in fuel and food prices we have accordingly adjusted our opening price point offer and our range is now extremely competitive
5238415 sadc free trade area for growth development and wealth creation
5238416 rather we should view the achievement of this milestone as a major step towards addressing the fundamental challenges of poverty and underdevelopment through deeper integration and economic development
5238417 regional economic cooperation and integration offer us the opportunity to pool our limited resources and build an economic base to address the challenges of economic growth and development
5238418 bricknell is seeking independent legal and financial advice on the value of the shares and will revert back to me later in the week on the disposal of these shares

5238421 smith has known the team better in the last weeks so he will have a big say in sundays game
5238422 we have a very good record at home but it is not so good away from home north african teams are difficult to play against anywhere but with a passionate crowd behind them they are even more difficult to beat
5238423 but we have played some really good football and have momentum on the back of a really good season so if we get it clear in our minds we should able to get something out of this

5238429 after joining mendeley as executive chairman mr gl nzer brought the team in touch with the former founding engineers of skype

5238432 oh theyve been having an amorous rendezvous since they were in diapers
5238433 our level of play our standard of play is way above kotoko i have discussed with the coach all about kotoko the way they play they have young players about their current in shape and not
5238434 i have a really hard time imagining anything that rich people should be allowed to have as much of as they want while the same thing has to be limited in supply for poor people to prevent something horrible to happen i would love to get an example

5238438 i have now reached the point at which i no longer care whether or not the answer is nuclear let it happen as long as its total emissions are taken into account we know exactly how and where the waste is to be buried how much this will cost and who will pay and there is a legal guarantee that no civil nuclear materials will used by the military we can no longer afford any rigid principle but one that the harm done to people living now and in the future most be minimised by the most effective means whatever they might be

5238440 i am not surprised to see a breakthrough of 800 now and i guess whats coming into play now is more technical selling below 800
5238441 well have some people targeting 750 but i think we would need to see a continuation in that dollar strength to give it sufficient momentum to head that way
5238442 its a big smack obviously because of the resource prices coming down
5238443 despite new yorks dow jones being up resources are pulling down our market
5238444 there will be a precipitous slowdown in global growth and that means a lot less demand for things like energy and base metals
5238445 it would be insane to step in and buy oil or metals now these markets will be vulnerable for the next four of five months
5238446 whether that is a final peak or an intermediate peak followed by higher prices we dont know yet
5238447 the key concerns are over western economies perhaps more importantly emerging economies and predominantly china where growth has been slowing
5238448 we know how much president mwanawasa has sacrificed for this nation this is the man who has given the very best in the service of the people of zambia
5238449 the government will always count on the church as a reliable partner in national development and in shaping our nation morally
5238450 we are grateful to the government of zambia and its people for the goodwill we continue to enjoy
5238451 government appreciates this gesture especially that it is coming from people with a humble background it is rare because oftentime we see invitations from people from rich backgrounds
5238452 zaca is deeply concerned that this vital sector of the economy appears to be at risk as consumers confidence declines due to the never ending problems related to quality of service
5238453 for largely statistical reasons and a partial reversal in energy supply constraints growth will accelerate in the second quarter
5238454 however this should not be interpreted as a change in the cycle following a brief setback in the first quarter it is likely that gdp growth in q2 second quarter may overstate the real underlying strength in economic activity
5238455 i have assumed a 5 7 drop in the retail and wholesale category which will be the first quarterly decline since 2001 and the biggest quarterly decline since 1997
5238456 the department of construction in the ministry of local government public works and urban development due to its own fiscal related constraints has not attended to the leakages on the roofs of various buildings notably the library
5238457 a whole section of the library ceiling collapsed in march this year because of the leakages on the roof the college was lucky that this happened when there were no students in the library
5238458 with the approaching rainy season we are concerned that more damage will occur rendering the library unusable
5238459 our view is that the college requires a massive integrated rehabilitation programme which cannot be left to government alone
5238460 as an institution you must identify stakeholders and demonstrate to them the urgency of the leaking roof i therefore make an appeal to all stakeholders that there is need to recognise the enormous task that confronts the government as well as its limitations in addressing the above mentioned challenges
5238461 the college has the distinction of being the only tertiary institution that manufactures traditional african musical instruments such as marimba and mbira which have local and regional markets
5238462 this will not only be a good investment in terms of percentage returns but also a way of promoting zimbabwean traditional musical instruments and culture
5238463 it is disheartening to note that in an era where most people benefited from the land distribution programme such a big institution does not have land to supplement its programmes
5238464 the current status quo is that we are continuing with the strike action but they have promised that the intern doctors will be accommodated but since we have put the matter in writing we expect them to respond in writing
5238465 the vote obtained from our members in the two towns will be added before finally considering going on strike
5238466 we want to see to it that government does not only attend to the demands for accommodation for those based in lusaka but for all the doctors in the country
5238467 as a result of such public works mr hichilema can today leave his profession and pretend to dedicate the rest of his life to serving the zambian people
5238468 an elected official often dips into his or her private resources to carry out his or her duties because there has never and may never be enough resources to fund the activities of political office holders

5238473 there needs to be a link between the person who makes the judgment and those who decide on the punishment
5238474 some ministers forget to disclose the problem is the precedent it sets for those who have not done that
5238475 i dont get a sense that one would go out to disclose in fear of the consequences
5238476 i dont think people take the issue of disclosing seriously
5238477 it is a political decision at the end of the day what or who needs to be investigated
5238478 the punishment put in guidelines for future offenders it sent out a message that said dont do these type of things

5238497 over the past 30 years american politics has become more money centered at exactly the same time that american society has grown more unequal

5238500 canadas first adult video channel offering significant canadian adult content
5238501 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
5238502 there is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket
5238503 not less than 50 percent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 percent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming
5238504 we want to be canadas adult channel and i think to do that 15 percent wouldnt cut it
5238505 ive been in touch with the cable companies throughout the process and went ahead with it based on the interest we had
5238506 its very unfortunate i was not even around when the incident occurred because we have another vessel at dock yard which i was also supervising but when it happened my second azeez called me on phone and i quickly alerted my security supervisor who asked me to rush immediately to attend to the case on getting here i learnt that francis and phillip went into a bet for the fastest swimmer and in the process he francis got drowned i quickly mobilised a search at least to fish out the dead body but all our efforts were in vain since then we have spread information around for people to contact us immediately a dead body is seen floating at any bank of the riverside i along with the two boys involved in the incident have given our statements to the area b police command apapa where the matter is being investigated at the moment
5238507 how can one tell me that a boy born in the sea school riverrine area 19 years ago could drown just like that if they were sincere why did nobody contact me from mid day when the incident happened until around 7pm when i became worried and started asking questions why is it that those who own the vessel since then had made no attempt to commiserate with my family to show concern that this was a boy working for them before the incident whether he was a casual or permanent worker how can such a big vessel not have security facilities to forestall such occurrences or provide rescue in cases of accidents and if they have why did they allow my son to drown no there is something to it they will provide my son or get ready to bury me along
5238508 the betting story is a ruse i did not train my child to bet and gamble they have not said exactly what happened he left home that day and told me that instead of staying idle at home he was going to look for a casual work to do and save for his school and then take care of us as we are no longer too strong in fact since i stopped my driving work because of my health the boy had been the bread winner of the house he is not my only son but he is the only one with me now who also takes care of me and his mother no matter where he may be he makes sure that by 6pm he is in the house but on this fateful day he was nowhere to be seen by 7pm and that was when i got worried and started asking around why is life this cruel and why should those who own the vessel treat me this way because i am poor can you imagine that nobody has actually sat me down to tell me what happened except the snippets i hear from the police and the little kids who also do casual work in the vessel where a re the owners of vessel or are they pretending that it is not a human life that is involved here is it beyond them to hire expert divers since all these days and make a proper search even if to get the dead body of my son cant you see there is something to it
5238509 we did not bet any money to swim but what happened was that immediately after break we were looking at the waters and he told me that swimming in this kind of dirty water could be dangerous i told him that i can enter the water without any harm and he said he would give me n100 if i could swim in the water so i lowered myself in the water and immediately came out but as i was made to put on my clothes i dont know whether he slipped and fell into the water or something but i just saw he was crying for help so i helped in raising the alarm i did not stake anything with him against who swims better or faster
5238510 i did not hold betting money for them before the incident we francis and i had finished eating akara bean cake and he asked me to help him hold the sum of n1 100 he was having with him and i obliged but not too long after i collected the money from him i had a shout that someone was drowning and i quickly dived into the water to save him unfortunately i couldnt find his body and again i had a cut on my foot from the wrecks under the water i immediately managed to swim out because i know that dangerous fish could perceive the blood odour and come after me i was not holding any stake money and besides it was only for him i was holding the money for
5238511 students feel secure to know if there has been an incident for instance bullying we can then go back and look what happened
5238512 no one really knows enough about the use of cctv in schools its a very new issue we have set up a working group to look into the use of cctv and produce atl guidelines on best practice for schools and colleges throughout the uk
5238513 certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of cctv in schools and strict safeguards for its use although surveillance in schools can have some positive outcomes such as discouraging vandalism and violence we think there are some instances where it should be strictly controlled

5238539 we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5238540 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5238541 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the birds nest for more
5238542 and will encourage him to come back to the track

5238552 i think playing against belarus is similar to playing against other european teams
5238553 if we can make full use of our strong points we can beat them
5238554 if we can beat spain and the czechs then we can beat belarus im absolutely confident
5238555 i have to confess that we are weaker than the united states
5238556 i dont think we can win i just want a good game
5238557 we have to do more research on them and we have to strengthen our offence

5238566 at a time when major environmental challenges face the nation and the world it is crucial that our next generation of students receive the education and tools they need to face these challenges head on
5238567 many of us can remember our first school field trip to a nature center and how those experiences shaped who we are today its essential that we share these values with our children
5238568 look at me im different my life is worse than everyone else
5238569 are you kidding me they charge 50 cents every time you ride it would be a dollar for me to get anywhere i wanted to go
5238570 you have to pay your friends more than that when they pick you up to take you places
5238571 i dont pay anyone anything to give me a ride
5238572 its bad enough that i dont have a car i would never pay for a ride i need my money
5238573 but your friends are elderly and retired the same as you
5238574 they are rich enough to afford a car they can carry me when i need a ride
5238575 im just not able to cope today with the anger of some of the people who call making demands that public transportation cant provide

5238594 in my first picture i made a startling discovery things danced on the screen do not look the way they do on the stage on the stage dancing is three dimensional but a motion picture is two dimensional also i felt the dancer in films had never had the opportunity to probe emotional and acting problems adequately so i tried to do things uniquely cinematic that you couldnt do on a stage call it cine dancing or whatever but i tried to invent the dance to fit the camera and its movements

5238603 zim opposition given ultimatum sign deal or let parliament decide
5238604 the threat by sadc leaders to take the matter to parliament could therefore be seen as a way of exerting pressure on tsvangirai to sign
5238605 parliament had not been sworn in largely because the presidency was being disputed
5238606 mugabe would immediately have to appoint a new cabinet doing this before negotiations are completed would entail tsvangirai being excluded from a new government
5238607 it encouraged more entrepreneurial exuberance than the social system could bear

5238612 there are lots of problems with the river murray but lack of environmental flows is without a doubt the biggest one we need to have much bigger environmental flows passing down there through the coorong and out the mouth a healthy river should be able to keep its own mouth open and shouldnt need any sort of dredging or artificial assistance in keeping sand out of its mouth
5238613 australian rivers fall rapidly from the mountains in which they originate into a level and extremely depressed country having weak and inconsiderable sources and being almost wholly unaided by tributaries of any kind they naturally fail before they reach the coast and exhaust themselves in marshes or lakes or reach it so weakened as to be unable to preserve clear or navigable mouths or to remove the sand banks that the tide throws up before them
5238614 we had at length arrived at the termination of the murray immediately below me was a beautiful lake which appeared to be a fitting reservoir for the noble stream that had led us to it and which was now ruffled by the breeze that swept over it
5238615 the transition from fresh to salt water was almost immediate
5238616 the stillness of the night was broken by the roar of the ocean now too near to be mistaken for wind or by the silvery and melancholy note of the black swans as they passed over us to seek food no doubt among the slimy weeds at the head of the lake
5238617 shoals again closed in upon us on every side we dragged the boat over several and at last got amongst quicksands

5238649 the condition was that marty would have to graduate from college
5238650 after enjoying the ominous label i was delightfully surprised by the inviting golden amber color that seemed to beckon
5238651 once i made it past the label it was good to know i could indeed open a bottle without looking at it i noticed the minimal head upon pouring the sample that i had
5238652 what can i say i never met an ipa under 8 that i didnt like this is a good beer that your typical ninja could drink and still manage to fight the bad guys im no ninja but id like to know what the hell is sticking out of the backs of the guys on the label tennis rackets look i dont drink beer for the labels but i think you guys are on to something the camaraderie displayed by the bros on the label made me want to look for someone else to share this brew with but alas i only had one bottle and no one else showed up while i was drinking it which only took about 20 minutes how can i get more of this ale
5238653 scary red shiny yet smiling the label that remained in the back of the fridge until i mustered the courage to grasp it to drink was truly an oxymoron the best of the four you brewed this time i cant say enough good about this the head was astounding and the flavor phenomenal i admit i am a big amber fan but you guys have out done yourselves with this one i like love and want this beer i dont care if the girl amber fries her face off in the tanning bed as long as this brew is available for me as i watch her smolder all joking aside you fellows have really achieved greatness with this beer and should you ever have excess of this particular type of ale let me help you make room in your quarters by taking whatever you can spare if the store sold this i would buy it often

5238735 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5238736 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5238737 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else
5238738 one of the unique ways ibm research stays ahead of the competition is by looking at innovations that will have a real world impact
5238739 now through our collaborative model we are helping the it market explore new growth opportunities enabled by our state of the art speech technologies and solutions
5238740 speech is becoming increasingly equivalent to text due to decades of research investment such as that of ibm research improved performance and tools for interpreting the resulting text are driving rapid growth for example of speech as an interface to mobile phones
5238741 one particularly effective approach is the voice search model just say what you want and get it to shorten transactions transcription of voicemail and call center conversations to text makes it possible to quickly search and analyze the result creating new growth and flexibility in unified communications and customer service analytics

5238775 it was interesting and rather disturbing to see that the south african swim captain was apparently celebrating the fact that i did not win a medal in the event
5238776 an athlete from another country who sat next to gerhard came to me afterwards and told me how shocked he was to see gerhard openly celebrate the result with a big smile on his face what can i say to that but captain my captain i hope its not the typical south african reaction
5238777 as the captain of the south african swimming squad the team feels that the direction in which recent activities are going is not in favour of the national team and national squad
5238778 all the performance athletes had to sign a code of conduct in which we are bound by certain criteria the cut off date by which the contract had to be signed was may 18 2007 the four male swimmers lyndon ferns neethling schoeman and darian townsend would like to have the rules bent so they can benefit without being a part of the team they do not see themselves part of the team in this situation anyway
5238779 unfortunately south africa didnt win a medal although almost everybody broke sa and african records
5238780 it was a young team with lots of talent but the mentality within swimming in south africa has to change in order for the swimmers and coaches to reach their full potential
5238781 we are committed to running a successful football club and have already commenced a schedule of improvements to maintain the ground to a high standard
5238782 this is excellent news for the council and dorking fc and more importantly for the people of mole valley

5238814 liu has several cars but is not allowed to drive for fear of getting injured nobody asks him out for a meal in case the food has something bad in it there is a group of men following him for 24 hours he cant even drink a bottle of water if he doesnt know exactly where it comes from
5238815 he was too thin and seemed to walk in a strange way
5238816 of course ive thought about that but the 110 metres hurdles isnt my whole life i have many other opportunities if i win then that would be amazing if i lose then thats alright
5238817 it was a difficult day for us because watford do not play good football
5238818 i feel a bit disappointed because for 20 minutes there when we conceded that goal that was very costly for us
5238819 i think we should have got something out of this game
5238820 hes had no rest but is due back this week from the olympics
5238821 his future is in doubt in terms of he could be sold but well have to wait and see
5238822 the second year in the championship after relegation is tricky for the board they have to make a calculated decision as to where they are going to draw the finances because that second payment is a big hole that you wont get next year so you have to realign yourself and that is a process were going through us and watford
5238823 it was a fair result the sending off changed the game but had it not been for some acrobatics from nicky weaver it would have been more
5238824 the last six months of last season has done me and the club good because it has put our feet back down on the ground again and made us realise that it isnt the big stars that get you there but the team
5238825 what it did was teach me a lot about human beings you get to a place with people and think you can trust them and you think theyre just as ambitious as you are but money seems to talk for some but thats human nature theyre not here anymore things have moved on but i know when success comes around again and it will do that ill be a lot more prepared for it itll make things sweeter as well

5238836 eles correram porque quiseram correr eles jamais deram chance para o advers rio o m rito todo dos jogadores meu discurso sempre vai ser esse depois de uma vit ria tentei passar alguma coisa para eles mas muita coisa que fizeram foi improvisa o deles o ferreira por exemplo se ele n o puder usar a cria o que o forte ele est morto
5238837 eu acho que a quando a gente n o tinha uma seq ncia de jogos a gente precisava de apoio mas dif cil quando a gente vem aqui e xingado chamado de time sem vergonha e se o jogador n o est preparado ele sente mas se o treinador passa confian a a gente entra solto e sem medo de errar a gente pode tirar li o para o resto do campeonato com esse esp rito com essa vontade vamos dar um bom prosseguimento no competi o
5238838 o m rio um cara bastante aberto e ele mostrou que todos os jogadores podem participar da parte t tica n o fomos perfeitos mas mostrou o comprometimento de todos e esse o caminho para darmos uma guinada no segundo turno

5238844 i wouldnt sell one of my best players to my rivals sell him abroad
5238845 its getting boring weve known for ages hes going to go his attitude stinks and 25m is fine with me
5238846 whether fergie refuses to cough up the 30m or ramos keeps him at spurs i just dont see this happening and before man utd fans have a go at me im not saying this out of hate its just my honest opinion
5238847 long term he is the wrong man for the club sir alex ferguson would sell him with in two seasons
5238848 i just want him to leave now no ones bigger than the team
5238849 we havent seen the best of him yet hes only working at about 65 fitness at the moment
5238850 i cant say hes renowned for long range strikes but hes got great quality with both feet
5238851 hopefully when we get to the bottom of this ankle business well see even more from him
5238852 students feel secure to know that if there has been an incident ie bullying we can then go back and look what happened
5238853 where there is not a high level of trust staff may have concerns that evidence may be gathered against them
5238854 no one really knows enough about the use of cctv in schools its a very new issue
5238855 certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of cctv in schools and strict safeguards for its use
5238856 although surveillance in schools can have some positive outcomes such as discouraging vandalism and violence we think there are some instances where it should be strictly controlled

5238918 morgan nicholas who designed and helped build the pavilions karting track has been in discussion with kerry about the ride for several months
5238919 before the fire the ride was due to be part of a new plan to be revealed this september
5238920 no formal planning application will be submitted until the structural engineers have come back to us
5238921 because this ride would go above the shelters on the pier it needed to be very different
5238922 the maximum speed is still under discussion and if the plans get the go ahead i would imagine it could take about six months to build

5238959 i also work really hard choosing my words very carefully to avoid being bulky and heavy handed
5238960 i dont like all those words like wiser or mature or reflective
5238961 i couldnt give you a well rounded phrase on how i feel now versus 15 years ago i know that im more interested in saying certain things because i do believe if you say things you can make them true if i sing a line like something good this way comes its because a i believe it and b i need to keep believing it but its not motivational speaking there is dark there is light and its important to have it all represented
5238962 when you hold an acoustic guitar people think you are being very confessional
5238963 i feel quite the opposite not just with this record but in general i didnt have anything about myself that i necessarily wanted to say these were my thoughts a paternally nasal emphasis breaks through his carefully calibrated west coast drawl but if you were curious about me i dont think youd learn much from these songs
5238964 im an educated virgin let me drown or learn how to swim
5238965 its not conducive to writing good material with people who care about that stuff the stretch that theyre willing to go to analyse my songs is astounding at times its become a game of outwitting each other or proving they can draw six degrees of kevin bacon nothing im going to do will stop that process but its not entertainment for me in the rest of my life i dont see it or hear about it though so it doesnt matter

5238967 your dad writes of it being impossible now for me to observe anything without being observed a heck of a position for a writer to be in but havent you been observed all your life
5238968 its something im aware of but its something i dont have any interest in any more if youd asked me that 10 years ago i might have had a different answer if youre talking in a familial sense of where i come from without any hesitation without any bitterness without any regrets i couldnt care any less about that at this point i choose to believe that the interest in my songs arises because ive been a songwriter for 15 years
5238969 i dont know what the word is to describe how i may have behaved but people were less kind and i was never going to be a tool for anybody people always have an easy time mistaking quietude for arrogance
5238970 first i dont make it my business to give anybody career advice and second i will certainly not give him any because hes busy doing that by example for most of us anyway his experience is invaluable and i have the ability to get information about that stuff but any advice he gives publicly is in the book which he was paid for anything that goes beyond that im thinking of charging
5238971 when i write mine i wont ask anybody for permission either did people find it like insightful
5238972 well at least thats the effort of the book and thats why i hesitate to say too much because hes still busy weaving whatever web he wants to weave t how to be real good at it
5238973 at the same time im not sweating about how important i am ive never worried too much about being inventive or original those are just nonsensical words to me when making art i feel like i come in a long line of traditionalists that im a team player and i serve a good purpose
5238974 it doesnt give people any value to know about that its used for voyeuristic ends
5238975 i had a feeling something was going on with those two but seeing it for real burned like a 45 slug going right into my foot and believe me ive shot myself in the foot plenty of times not that i could blame phillie she was a hot tomato with that tight little bun the other one drooped though you could count on her not like my two timing floozy of a wife
5238976 i look better than you ever did no one messes with my man and gets away with it
5238977 i do its just the way i am and have always been you are the only girl for me but i just cant stay faithful its not your fault its me im a grifter you dont deserve me

5239001 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5239002 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5239003 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder
5239004 i really want you but i cant i dont think im over my ex yet
5239005 with the side we put out i was absolutely delighted i am proud of them all the vast majority of that team could be there in 10 years time there was a little concern after the break we might have caved in but the team showed fantastic character to come back and you know we were probably unlucky in the end maybe not to have won the game

5239101 were doing everything we can out there were riding as hard as possible on the rockstar makita suzuki gsx r1000 thanks to my team for giving me a completely different motorcycle to race today though we just didnt quite have enough for mat today but well keep on riding as hard as we can every weekend even though we didnt get the win hats off to my teammates for a great race and going one two three for rockstar makita suzuki
5239102 ive really gotten my starts figured out in the last few weeks and thats made a big difference for me it was a less exciting race for the fans but i enjoyed being up there with my rockstar makita suzuki teammates in first second and third my teammates are the best riders by far out here in my opinion and we are on the best bikes as well its nice to have some momentum to finish off the season with and my goal is to be back up on the podium and keep the momentum going

5239108 kevin i agree with teacher that bullying is not working for russia just because they are invading and getting away with it for the moment they are turning the whole world against them for their overreaction
5239109 teacher i agree with you the world is fraught with danger and it is going to stay that way yet the positive is there and i dont think it gets talked about enough and i do think in the long term that is the trend

5239130 its a big step forward to have the department of fisheries doing this i give the minister full credit for speaking out publicly in the media about the need to reduce the grey seal numbers and the need to do it on sable island we do need the higher quota and we do need access to sable island thats where the big herd is at and where its concentrated
5239131 as long as they say that publicly its very difficult to gain acceptance from the general public around the world about the need to reduce the numbers the scientists continue to ignore the impact of parasites in fish that come from grey seals that we know are killing the fish we have fishermen who are observing spawning fish being chased off spawning grounds by large number of grey seals

5239158 the document signed by mikhail saakashvili completely omits the opening sentence the introductory part it is an integral part of the document and when the leaders of south ossetia abkhazia and now russia have signed the document they signed an agreed version not some shortened or edited one
5239159 this weeks events in georgia have taken that outcome another major step closer and when you appreciate that if obama is elected in november then america is actually putting brzezinski and soros in the white house you can see the potential for global mayhem

5239213 why of course the people dont want war that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
5239214 if everyone else is thinking this it must be right
5239215 1 3 gegen den vfb stuttgart im ersten spiel nach der bundesliga r ckkehr wie haben sie die partie gesehen
5239216 das war ein absolut verdienter sieg f r den vfb stuttgart wir haben vor allem in der ersten halbzeit lehrgeld gezahlt auch wenn wir selbst gute chancen hatten das 0 1 ist ungl cklich weil zu diesem zeitpunkt sascha r sler verletzt au erhalb behandelt wird da sind wir dann im mittelfeld nicht mehr organsiert beim 0 2 geben wir den ball an der grundlinie her das darf nicht passieren und auch beim 0 3 sind wir in der vorw rtsbewegung die beiden treffer haben uns gezeigt dass in dieser liga jeder kleine fehler bestraft wird
5239217 war ihre abwehr noch nicht auf das tempo in der bundesliga eingestellt
5239218 die beiden tore haben nichts mit umschalten zu tun bei solchen fehlern hat es die verteidigung nat rlich sehr schwer stuttgart hat heute super umgeschaltet wir haben es nicht gut genug gemacht und m ssen daran in den n chsten tagen und wochen weiter hart arbeiten wir wissen dass wir noch zulegen m ssen im abwehrverhalten und im umschalten von offensive auf defensive
5239219 wir hatten vorne einige chancen auch direkt nach der pause eine hundertprozentige wenn man die vergibt rgert man sich nat rlich aber dass wir uns viele torchancen erspielt haben ist positiv und nicht aus jeder chance wird ein tor aber wir haben uns nicht aufgegeben das ist eine gute eine wichtige charaktereigenschaft wir haben voll auf risiko gespielt und wollten das spiel irgendwie drehen leider haben wir es nicht mehr geschafft das 2 3 zu machen und f r noch mehr spannung zu sorgen
5239220 wie haben sie die leistung ihres torh ters christofer heimeroth gesehen
5239221 einen vergleich mit jens lehmann sollte man nicht ziehen christofer ist gerade erst als nummer eins in der ersten liga angekommen jens lehmann ist schon fast am ende einer tollen karriere christofer heimeroth macht eine ungl ckliche figur aber die entscheidenden fehler sind vorher passiert
5239222 fear stops child development can we find an acceptable level of risk to allow for our children no more or less than my generation had so that being outside is an adventure and they gain confidence rather than reflecting societys fears

5239224 undoubtedly the dialogue of religions as he sees the first three teams is unacceptable as religions do not engage in dialogue and some in some melts and can not be common ground among religions is the criterion of faith dialogue among the owners
5239225 this message of islam which unload the contents which sent the message that i got two copies heavenly body heres the book right down on what came before writers and dominant we want is not islam as a religion would not accept him

5239230 it feels like your own brother has cut off your head
5239231 after what happened it should be clear that they should have self determination
5239232 the reality is that for 15 years at least south ossetia and abkhazia have been independent in fact
5239233 its not true the goal of russia is peace in the caucasus

5239239 i thought we were well in the game and when we got back on level terms i felt that we were in the ascendancy and that we were going to go on from that

5239241 the erp leader for professional services industries and other companies focused on project related work
5239242 these last couple weeks i spent more time with you than i ever spent with him
5239243 must have been hard on you that doctor dying huh
5239244 i have to ask you if hes the reason why we fought so much while i was away
5239245 he wanted to tell you but he couldnt so im telling you for him if he had to die im happy he died in love
5239246 we got close too close but it was over before you got back
5239247 you and i both know that the worst thing in the field is a soldier worried about problems back home
5239248 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
5239249 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5239250 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5239251 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5239252 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5239253 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5239254 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5239255 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5239256 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5239257 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5239258 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5239259 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5239260 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5239261 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5239262 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5239263 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5239264 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5239265 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5239266 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
5239267 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5239268 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5239269 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment

5239316 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5239317 everyone expected liu to do well as well as he did four years ago
5239318 we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5239319 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5239320 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the birds nest for more
5239321 and will encourage him to come back to the track
5239322 i think they will be disappointed but they will understand

5239334 the gaffer has shown so much faith and belief in me since taking over and thats been a real help
5239335 hes believed in me played me and because hes done that its given me the confidence to go out there and play my own game
5239336 i came to the club on a real high and although last year didnt quite go as planned i got myself back into the team and got a few goals towards the end
5239337 it was pretty swollen and didnt give him any time to recover he will be out for two or three weeks
5239338 ryan hurt his hamstring so we had to bring him off as well which between the pair of them meant we lost experience at vital moments in the game
5239339 its impossible to say that six treatments will get rid of the hair
5239340 everyone requires a different type of treatment based on their skin hair color and texture
5239341 someone like bigfoot would definitely need more than six treatments
5239342 wide or disfigured feet however often require some form of binding and casting
5239343 the obama people must feel that he obama didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to that context because what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions to were to obama he seemed
5239344 but mum mum you see the challenge is we spoke mandarin all day except for a little bit at the end
5239345 one would ignore aluminium and steel at this point of time aluminium on account of weakness in global prices and steel on account of the fact that still there is a lot of confusion and they will not be able to raise prices for the next few months in the domestic markets so ignore both these sectors at this point of time but then if there is some more correction from these levels then steel would be the first sector that we would be keen to pick up stocks in given that lot of companies over there are coming out with huge expansions which are going on stream so even if the prices do not move up a lot of profit growth would come through increase in volumes
5239346 in hindalco the rights are to discount so to that extent i think there is a bit of a trading play but i think we have to play it very carefully because how the stock price reacts exactly at the point of time which the rights issue is open a lot would depend on that but by and large its not a company that we would like to be holding for the long term and a bit of a trading play here or there is fine
5239347 they really are just trying to sell newspapers with sensationalism because nobody with a brain can be stupid enough to believe what they have written

5239351 when you talk about respect officials have got to learn respect
5239352 i expect officials to see something as blatant as that its not just one arm it was two arms in the back of him and i could see it on the halfway line
5239353 youve got to be strong and know what youre doing as officials i feel bitterly let down because a sad day if we had got the penalty we would have been in the ascendancy because they created nothing and didnt hurt us
5239354 in kishtwar which witnessed violence last week there was no untoward incident and curfew has been relaxed for the day however tension is still high
5239355 it is an ho nour to be recognized for our support and contribution to the derdack success story we have been partners for 2 years and in this time we have seen a growing interest and acceptance of the mobile messaging products offered by derdack in our region
5239356 the ease with which the derdack products can be integrated into existing it systems and the speed of implementation are very important aspects of the projects we undertake in addition the innovation and vision of the derdack team helps us create new opportunities for growing our business which is good news for both ihorizons and derdack
5239357 we invest time in ensuring our partner channel can be effective the annual derdack partner conference allows us to say thank you to our part ners update them on our plans for the year ahead and enable them to see new product developments we have built a strong revenue stream with the help of our partners and we all look forward to 2009 being another year of growth
5239358 there are very specific goals to be achieved and you start the contract knowing that those things have to be delivered by a certain date the mindset is that from day one you are planning your exit strategy
5239359 the ability to solve problems and a track record in doing that
5239360 if you look back at your last five years in corporate life and see it as a series of projects solving problems that other organisations will face
5239361 experience is crucial you need to be able to quickly assess problems and requirements and very quickly come up with an approach to how you will tackle that and you need experience to do that
5239362 network and influence at board level construct a business case for board level presentation have a positive impact on the profit and loss of an operation construct metrics for performance and manage people and mitigate risk in delivery
5239363 you need the motivation and willingness to go out and market yourself
5239364 the best interim managers do not necessarily get the best assignments if they are not in the right place at the right time to get it
5239365 i believe someone managing an it department has a shelf life of about three years so if youre going to be forced to change jobs that often you might as well do it more often develop a skillset and get paid more for it
5239366 that will help you understand what you can deliver to the market as a quick win
5239367 yes i remember im a girl and i think my name is hemika lon but i still cant remember where i am or why crud

5239374 a conductor takes your name which is written on a piece of paper and destroys it next you reach in to a box your name erased from your memory and pick a new one then you get off the train at hully station there they check you into the society and assign you a job your best suited for most of us end up as workers anyway heres the four main things

5239378 is actually a tracer they know everywhere youve been and they can send shock waves threw your entire body if you misbehave theres a rumor about the free collars a group of citizens who somehow took off there leashes and roam around secretly trying to break the lords rain of terror apparently theyre searching for a way out

5239408 yeah but you still got threw the pain and you can buy cool stuff like tvs or stereos or even a better house
5239409 what if you dont want any of those things and you didnt mind the pain could you just not work
5239410 no those bracelets let the pigs know where you are and if you havent worked for to long without a logical excuse they shock you they want laborers so the high and might ones can live comfortable
5239411 high and mighty one s i though there was only one high and mighty the lord or something

5239423 the response of the retailers has been very good they are doing this day and night
5239424 in the longer term they have to reissue new terminals that cannot be compromised quite so easily
5239425 they can already make shops aware of the risk and rely on the detecting software to tell them which terminals seem to be compromised
5239426 they will not be able to tell from a device that it has been compromised the advice is to check your statements regularly
5239427 a ministerial commission which met on monday approved the list of 200 palestinian prisoners who are to be released as a goodwill gesture toward palestinian president mahmud abbas

5239429 a unique approach to public health in the province of quebec has other provinces and indeed other countries taking notice by requiring other government departments to consult with the minister of health and social services in regard to decisions or actions that could impact public health a broader more comprehensive and inclusive approach to public health strategies and interventions has been taken 420 the consulting component of this whole of government approach came into law with the adoption of article 54 in quebecs public health act in 2001 it states that new measures provided for in an act or regulation in all provincial ministries be assessed to determine significant impacts of proposed actions on the health of populations a process is currently used to carry out these determinations an approach that is fairly new to canada outside of quebec but more common in some european countries at the national level canadas national collaborating centre for healthy public policy is currently studying in relation to article 54 and public policy and will disseminate its findings to the public health community

5239445 i am aware that shipping costs from places like france fiji new zealand etc are significant plastic bottles use a lot petroleum to make plastic bottles go directly into landfill and break down very slowly in spite of those facts i think that the consumption of bottled water needs to be viewed in terms of long term dietary trends in the u s since roughly the 1930s there has been a long term decline in per capita alcohol consumption hard liquor consumption just fell off the table and beer is in slow decline wine consumption in flat at best there are just some really significant changes going on and they are really long term trends what did grow during that time period was consumption of soft drinks all during the 1990s per capita consumption grew around 3 a year in the 2000s they have been declining about 3 annually the figures are still astounding here is the per capita consumption of 12 oz cans 789 in 2007 814 in 2006 828 in 2005 849 in 2000 since i dont drink any i wonder who is drinking my 789 cans of pop each year as soft drink consumption has declined in this decade the consumption of bottled water has been growing at roughly 9 annually now lets put this in perspective in 2007 the dollar value of soft drinks consumed in the u s was just over 70 billion the same number for bottled water is 12 billion from this view consumption of bottled water is a good thing it is beyond question that we have a very serious obesity problem in the u s and we have accompanying health problems i would love to see every one of those 12 oz soft drinks replaced by bottled water and remember that many of those soft drinks are also packaged in plastic bottles my take is that every can of pop replaced by a bottle of water is a very very good thing you cant get fat drinking water and you cant get diabetes from drinking water so we wont have to pay for the health care costs from those problems when those very real benefits are weighed against the costs listed at the beginning of this rant i think bottle water wins by a wide margin what is really encouraging is that on my last gig at the university california irvine everyone seemed to be carrying a bottle of water and it seemed like there was a bottle on most desks in the class room fifty years ago anyone seen carrying a bottle of water around the university of minnesota campus would have been laughed out of town so changing social values are on the side of bottled water

5239447 our figures clearly demonstrate that there is a vast difference in rental values across the uk and a north south divide is very much evident
5239448 however no matter where a deposit is handed to a landlord and regardless of the size of that deposit landlords in england and wales are legally bound to protect it
5239449 landlords from sedgefield to westminster must be sure to comply with tenancy deposit legislation if they want to avoid a hefty fine if tenants havent received notification of deposit protection they should check with their landlord that their deposits are safe the dps sends confirmation of a protected deposit direct to the tenant

5239535 i am absolutely thrilled with the results and the difference it has made to the house is wonderful
5239536 like most people i was slightly worried about the disruption the fitting of a new kitchen and bathroom would cause but the workmen left the place spotless at the end of every day and i was never without running water or a toilet for the night
5239537 there was always someone available to answer my questions and to complete the work in only 15 days was marvellous i cant praise the team enough
5239538 its a real milestone for the whole team to have successfully completed the improvements to the first property and we are looking forward to making a real difference to many more blackpool coasting housing tenants over the next three years
5239539 i am pleased this work has made a valuable improvement to mrs simmons day to day life
5239540 this is the start of transforming and improving many more lives and homes over the next few years this work will help towards our long term goals of creating sustainable communities

5239550 people come to the market for the life and the carry on after all theres not much more to hexham is there
5239551 the traders cries are part of the colour of the market they put on a fabulous display even though not enough people come here any more
5239552 no one i know who runs a business in the square has complained about the traders just a few who are working in offices nearby it is cracked
5239553 the market traders have got to be allowed to shout their wares its been allowed for eight hundred years why stop it now
5239554 it was only a couple of years ago hexham was voted britains best market town what kind of market town bans its market traders
5239555 words fail me traders pitching their wares contributes to the atmosphere and ambience of the marketplace
5239556 it is a tradition particularly for fruit and veg traders to tout their wares by advertising the bargains they have on offer
5239557 often their cries are witty and humorous and i think it would be a great shame if this was lost
5239558 markets add to the viability and vitality of towns they have survived because people have sought something different to the anodyne and sterile experience of shopping in a supermarket
5239559 they offer a unique shopping experience where you are buying from a guy or a girl who knows exactly what they are selling and where it came from
5239560 we appreciate that calling out is part of the standard practice on markets but we had to agree with people working in the area that on some occasions this has gone beyond what is felt to be reasonable
5239561 we talked to the traders about this on a number of occasions before sending them a letter which is not asking them to stop calling but to reduce the volume and frequency
5239562 the problem is that we have developed the market and it now runs six days a week
5239563 there are offices surrounding the market square and during the hot weather many of them have had to open windows to let in cool air and the shouting from the market has made it difficult for them to conduct business
5239564 so the traders have not been told to shut up just to keep the volume down on a few days in the week out of consideration for others
5239565 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect

5239588 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5239589 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5239590 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5239591 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5239592 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5239593 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5239594 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5239595 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5239596 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5239597 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5239598 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5239599 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5239600 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

5239614 raja farah merupakan kawan terdekat di malaysia yang begitu memahami tentang saya malah dia juga merupakan seorang wanita yang boleh dikategori gadis berpendidikan
5239615 kebiasaannya kami akan berborak dan bincangkan senario yang berlaku dalam industri seni di malaysia dan indonesia sambil duduk di kafe kopi
5239616 atas faktor itu yang menjadikan saya dan raja farah serasi bersama cuma jangan salah sangka dengan kemesraan kami berdua
5239617 selain raja farah saya juga mengenali beberapa rakan artis di malaysia
5239618 sebelum ini ada sekali saya pernah menonton lakonan raja farah selepas itu dia juga beberapa kali menunjukkan kepada saya drama dan filem yang dijayakan
5239619 saya menganggap raja farah sebagai pelakon yang mempunyai keistimewaan tersendiri dia juga boleh ditafsirkan sebagai artis yang hebat
5239620 dengan sikap yang sentiasa rendah diri ramah dan tidak sombong membuatkan saya dan raja farah serasi sebagai teman
5239621 kalau tak silap saya mula kenal dengan dia dua tahun lalu saya akui bersahabat dengan ressa tetapi hubungan kami berdua hanyalah sebagai kawan saja
5239622 ressa adalah salah seorang kawan artis yang saya ada dia dianggap sebagai individu yang seronok untuk berkawan dan merupakan lelaki yang baik
5239623 saya juga berpendapat ressa adalah justin timberlake indonesia dia boleh menyanyi sambil menari dengan baik
5239624 dia juga merupakan aktor terkenal di indonesia saya amat mengagumi bakat yang dimiliki pada ressa
5239625 kalau dihurai sebagai seorang kawan saya boleh katakan ressa sangat periang dan boleh kongsi apa saja ilmu serta pengalaman yang dia miliki
5239626 hubungan kami sekadar kawan kalau ressa datang kl dia akan beritahu saya saya mengaku kami memang pernah keluar bersama namun perjumpaan kami bukanlah berdua sebaliknya saya ditemani ibu
5239627 saya punya perancangan untuk memperkenal raja farah untuk berlakon dalam sinetron di negara saya belum menetapkan lagi waktu sesuai namun saya sudah merencana perkara tersebut
5239628 selain raja farah saya sudi untuk membuka peluang kepada artis malaysia lain untuk mengembangkan bakat yang mereka ada
5239629 saya ingin membuang persepsi negatif yang mengatakan karyawan seni di indonesia mengamal sikap berat sebelah sekiranya ada artis malaysia mahu membina nama di negara saya
5239630 sebenarnya tiada istilah penggiat seni indonesia yang menutup kemasukan orang malaysia untuk bergelar pelakon ataupun penyanyi di sana
5239631 kalau ada penyanyi malaysia yang mahu menerbitkan album di indonesia atau mendapatkan bantuan komposer kami saya sedia membantu malah menerima seadanya
5239632 itu janji saya lagipun saya lihat banyak artis tempatan yang sudah berjaya membina kemasyhuran di indonesia selain datuk siti nurhaliza saya perhatikan anuar zain dafi af5 dan beberapa nama lagi sudah melakar nama di negara kami
5239633 saya tidak anggap kedudukan menjadi perkara penting saya ceburi bidang nyanyian kerana miliki minat mendalam terhadap bidang ini
5239634 popular dicongak menerusi penilaian peminat yang selama ini menyokong perjalanan seni saya
5239635 saya tidak tekankan aspek kedudukan di tangga seni indonesia cuma apa yang boleh saya kata seluruh rakyat di negara saya mengenali dan tahu ressa herlambang
5239636 setelah jadi artis dan apabila terjaga daripada tidur pada setiap pagi ternyata saya cukup teruja untuk meneruskan hari
5239637 tugas sebagai penyanyi dan menghiburkan peminat menjadi tanggungjawab yang hebat
5239638 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5239639 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5239640 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5239641 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5239642 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5239643 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5239644 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5239645 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5239646 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5239647 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5239648 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5239649 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5239650 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5239651 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5239652 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5239653 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5239654 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5239655 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5239656 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5239657 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5239658 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5239659 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5239660 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5239661 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5239662 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5239663 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5239664 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5239665 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5239666 our travels to complete this film have been life changing i have met so many wonderful people and so many wonderful animals people keep contacting us wanting to make donations so while i was traveling i was also seeking the rescue organization that deserved the money and needed the money the most i was on a journey to find the place where the money would do the most good i found it villa lobos pit bull rescue in canyon country california absolutely blew my mind many of you will remember that pixie from la ink who is also featured in our documentary took the cameras from tlc and featured a special trip to villa lobos on the show pixie is the one who recommended to me that i go and i am forever grateful to her for the suggestion i began the donation process with a rather sizable check from my own personal bank account but more importantly i have begun a personal crusade to raise money for this facility with the help of you guys our loyal friends fans clients and family i know for a fact that at villa lobos dogs are being helped more than any other facility i have been to while creating this documentary for the last 2 years this location is the largest pit bull rescue in the country and has over 200 dogs at all times all of which are happy to be there and treated with an amazing amount of attention love medical care and respect tia maria torres is an incredible woman who is doing incredible things but she needs help it costs over 600 per day just to keep it going the truth is she needs a lot more than that it is the cleanest and best kept rescue operation i have ever seen as well and to maintain this level of comfort for these animals is also expensive please help us to raise some money for this magical place 1 5 10 20 500 1000 10 000 no donation is too small or too large not one penny will be kept from the mouths of these dogs and with villa lobos i can personally guarantee not one penny will go to waste if you cannot afford to donate you can still help us help them simply help us spread the word please help draw more attention to villa lobos and our film which features them please repost this as often as possible and send this out to your entire address book of contacts i feel incredibly fortunate to have actually physically been in so many wonderful facilities and met so many wonderful people im here to tell you though villa lobos is the bomb diggity
5239667 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5239668 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5239669 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5239670 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5239671 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5239672 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5239673 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5239674 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5239675 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5239676 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5239677 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5239678 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5239679 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5239680 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5239681 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5239682 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5239683 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5239684 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5239685 they were unwrapping the bandages on my hands when a trainee standing to the left of my bed asked me to clench my left fist but it was too painful
5239686 then the specialist doctor who was working on my right hand slapped me on my left cheek and asked me to look at her
5239687 she then pressed her hands around my right fist forcefully closing them
5239688 we have handed the case over to the police to investigate on the criminal element we also have submitted our findings to our disciplinary board

5239728 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5239729 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5239730 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5239731 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5239732 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5239733 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5239734 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5239735 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5239736 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

5239739 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5239740 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

5239743 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5239744 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5239745 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5239746 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5239747 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5239748 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5239749 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5239750 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5239751 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5239752 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5239753 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5239754 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5239755 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5239756 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5239757 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5239758 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5239759 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5239760 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5239761 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5239762 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5239763 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5239764 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5239765 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5239766 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5239767 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5239768 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5239769 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5239770 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5239771 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5239772 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5239773 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5239774 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5239775 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5239776 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5239777 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5239778 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5239779 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5239780 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5239781 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5239782 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5239783 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5239784 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5239785 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile

5239803 its being reported as if every off color remark is going to be illegal and thats creating a tremendous amount of misinformation
5239804 the reference to dirty jews and the further iteration of that comment to lets get rid of all those dirty jews hearkened cutler back to thoughts of one of the lowest times in mankinds history the holocaust the comments demonstrated an anti semitic bigotry that has no place in a workplace in this state
5239805 the question becomes what does severe mean because not every locker room joke or cross remark is going to constitute a hostile workplace
5239806 the court reaffirmed that theyll know it when they see it
5239807 the new rule is there was no employment harm in this case because the employee was not demoted or fired the only connection with his employment was that he felt his performance would not be evaluated fairly
5239808 it means if an employee in new jersey feels his employment is in jeopardy he may have case for retaliation under the hostile workplace
5239809 its being reported as if every off color remark is going to be illegal and thats creating a tremendous amount of misinformation

5239815 but i actually have a pretty good junior coming up so that will lessen the wound as they say
5239816 and diduch is pretty quiet as are most of the guys on defense so because of that communication is going to be a challenge for them
5239817 but i actually have a pretty good junior coming up so that will lessen the wound as they say
5239818 and diduch is pretty quiet as are most of the guys on defense so because of that communication is going to be a challenge for them
5239819 we had actually visited an mri suite down in miami and the decor blew me away
5239820 this will look completely different from the clinical setting see original
5239821 hes going to have to get used to playing in a varsity atmosphere we worked every day me and him on the shotgun on cadence wed do about 50 to 100 snaps
5239822 coach donald davis pretty much let us know that whatever happened last year is last year
5239823 we have a new mentality everyone wants a piece of that championship
5239824 he was fighting for a varsity job as a sophomore
5239825 as far as his tools and mechanics there are things weve got to work on like he drops his shoulder for us offensively he provides some things you usually dont get in high school
5239826 he did it in 7 on 7s can he identify the blitz do the check offs thats what we have to find out
5239827 hes going to have to get used to playing in a varsity atmosphere we worked every day me and him on the shotgun on cadence wed do about 50 to 100 snaps
5239828 coach donald davis pretty much let us know that whatever happened last year is last year

5239832 he did it in 7 on 7s can he identify the blitz do the check offs thats what we have to find out
5239833 our taxpayer money is not going to good use for these automatic weapons
5239834 there is a trend around the country of police departments getting more and more sophisticated weapons
5239835 the reason is that we have the same trend with our criminals who are arming themselves with these weapons
5239836 after 9 11 police departments became much more militarized in terms of response
5239837 tactical units were no longer just looked upon as a response to a situation with a couple of hostages but more of a counterterrorism unit there is this feeling that we now live in an era of counterterrorism and the feeling is that you need to be prepared
5239838 plus there are situations in the schools that have happened across the country we practice active shooter scenarios these days and these weapons are the best ones to handle these types of situations
5239839 paterson passaic and clifton should be armed to the teeth because there are a whole lot more weapons found in those areas
5239840 up here we need to have them in case we have a situation like in the north hollywood robbery i dont think in an area like this it would be feasible to have every officer have weapons like this in the trunk of their vehicle
5239841 were very fortunate that weve come to some very peaceful conclusions to most of the jobs over the years in bergen county
5239842 if you have to wait for somebody to go to paramus to pick up a ump it absolutely defeats the purpose
5239843 its not like a firetruck or a street sweeper you can schedule its a piece of equipment that has to be readily available to an officer at a moments notice
5239844 i wouldnt care if they had tanks if they needed them
5239845 im for having everything at your disposal as long as its used cautiously and in a measured way
5239846 i think the police have the right to protect themselves the best they can
5239847 but its not like the movies this is north arlington i could see it in new york city but its relatively quiet here
5239848 our taxpayer money is not going to good use for these automatic weapons
5239849 there is a trend around the country of police departments getting more and more sophisticated weapons
5239850 the reason is that we have the same trend with our criminals who are arming themselves with these weapons
5239851 after 9 11 police departments became much more militarized in terms of response
5239852 tactical units were no longer just looked upon as a response to a situation with a couple of hostages but more of a counterterrorism unit there is this feeling that we now live in an era of counterterrorism and the feeling is that you need to be prepared
5239853 plus there are situations in the schools that have happened across the country we practice active shooter scenarios these days and these weapons are the best ones to handle these types of situations
5239854 paterson passaic and clifton should be armed to the teeth because there are a whole lot more weapons found in those areas
5239855 up here we need to have them in case we have a situation like in the north hollywood robbery i dont think in an area like this it would be feasible to have every officer have weapons like this in the trunk of their vehicle
5239856 im happy with this positive development and i hope that more filipinos convicted of minor offenses will be given amnesty during ramadan
5239857 i spent all of last night thats why im very tired just trying to get the final interview with peter done everyone else has been interviewed so this is the final interview we finished with peter last night its good and it should be out in november
5239858 but the good thing about it is its not a peter book its a book from our perspective as well about how it affects us
5239859 they milf were using them civilians as human shields they killed them on their way out the description was they were killed like chickens thats the report from the civilians
5239860 as early as 1 a m today monday maasim saranggani was attacked by armed elements of milf followed by ambuscades in lanao norte municipalities
5239861 the pnp and armed forces are doing our best to secure other areas in lanao as well as other provinces affected by these movements by milf personnel
5239862 they left the area that is the report from our ground troops
5239863 they cant stay there too long they also felt the pressure from the military
5239864 as of now wala na as of now theres no more
5239865 but clearing operations are still ongoing in kolambugan because we have received reports that some rebels have disguised themselves as civilians
5239866 the milf leadership ordered them to pullout get out of the area
5239867 on the valuation basis banking sector are extremely attractive private sector bank as well as public sector banks yet at the same time now the gains which were coming from lower oil prices and the ripple effect over inflation and interest rates so that particular development already seems to have got priced in we have seen a decent rally coming in the banking stocks so at present its a bit of a statusquo there but my sense is that if one has a 6 12 months view then the banking stocks are quite attractive and one could gradually increase the holding within that space and the preference over here is for the private sector banks which have demonstrated excellent track record in the past few years and even in this difficult period which we are seeing for the last few months and some of the results which have come out from the private sector banks have been quite impressive so its a sector which one needs to increase the weightage gradually and have a bit of a long term view at least 6 12 months

5239885 woodson was supposed to go in with about four minutes left
5239886 but we got the ball taken away from us when the fumble call was overturned we didnt want to put him in a two minute situation because he had not had a two minute situation in practice
5239887 i dont think that would have been fair to him or the other players tom coughlin made that decision and i agreed with him
5239888 i really dont get nervous for games i was getting really excited obviously just getting on the field being out there with the giants wearing a uniform it was dream come true to walk on the field and know you finally made it to the nfl
5239889 i was ready to go out there and show what i have but unfortunately things happened and i have to wait until this week
5239890 he is like a lot of young quarterbacks he has it all upstairs as far as what the plays are but he is still working on being able to pull it out
5239891 im very happy with his delivery he came into camp with a little hitch which has improved
5239892 no one ever told me about the hitch until i got to the scouting combine
5239893 were just trying to quicken up the motion a little where i hold the ball it is difficult because you have to think of so much stuff and then they want you to think of that too it takes a little time but eventually you get the swing of it
5239894 thats important for a young quarterback and you try to explain things so he understands them
5239895 i think i have a little bit more of a sense of the offense
5239896 obviously its different terminology a lot more difficult than college and right now im just trying to pick up the speed and the offense

5239921 he turned back to me and said i thought about it
5239922 ive played in preseason games where you play two series and you go three and out three and out i feel like you get nothing accomplished that way
5239923 this was one of those times where everything seemed to be clicking wed like to have scored on the first drive but all in all it was good i was ok with it
5239924 the clock is obviously against me a little bit and to a certain degree maybe the team too just because we havent worked together that long
5239925 i understand maybe from a coachs standpoint you have to be smart but in my opinion the bottom line is winning and however we get to that point remains to be seen
5239926 if he says hey brett ill let you play as long as you want im all for it you have to get your feet wet somehow
5239927 there are certain situations that you dont get in the first two series of the game youd like to get a two minute drill youd like to get maybe some more red zone some more third downs
5239928 im sure well talk about it this week but believe me from my end ready or not i need to be in there
5239929 even though hes new with the offense every single time he comes in its like he has been with this offense for his whole career
5239930 he turned back to me and said i thought about it
5239931 ive played in preseason games where you play two series and you go three and out three and out i feel like you get nothing accomplished that way
5239932 this was one of those times where everything seemed to be clicking wed like to have scored on the first drive but all in all it was good i was ok with it

5239936 there are certain situations that you dont get in the first two series of the game youd like to get a two minute drill youd like to get maybe some more red zone some more third downs
5239937 im sure well talk about it this week but believe me from my end ready or not i need to be in there
5239938 even though hes new with the offense every single time he comes in its like he has been with this offense for his whole career
5239939 we had actually visited an mri suite down in miami and the decor blew me away
5239940 this will look completely different from the clinical setting see original
5239941 i am well aware that the current crop of fraudware software making the rounds targets windows but reality is that there is also fraudware in circulation that targets the mac and it is only a matter of time before there is an offering for linux after all linux users are just as at risk from social engineering as anybody else

5239943 hunger is a growing crisis in america with a stagnant economy and rising fuel prices the cost of food is soaring congress is reacting but will their efforts be enough anp spends a week with brian duss who agrees to take the food stamp challenge and live off a dollar per meal for 7 days
5239944 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5239945 everyone expected liu to do well as well as he did four years ago
5239946 we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5239947 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5239948 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the for more
5239949 and will encourage him to come back to the track
5239950 i think they will be disappointed but they will understand
5239951 to begin with let us take the following motto literature is love now we can continue
5239952 i can be changed by what happens to me but i refuse to be reduced by it
5239953 style is knowing who you are what you want to say and not giving a damn
5239954 perfume is like love you can never get enough of it
5239955 yesterday is history tomorrow is mystery today is a gift
5239956 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
5239957 guys are trying to get used to each other especially in the preseason weve got guys rotating in and out so much youre hardly ever next to the same guy i think thats part of it thats why you play preseason games to get the timing down
5239958 its a little bit of both having new guys in new positions and getting used to the technique and executing your blocks
5239959 at the same time the other team is making plays we have to make and finish plays rather than allow them to get into the lanes were supposed to keep them out of
5239960 right now we kind of have an idea whos going to be out there were trying to roll some guys in including some of the younger guys who we may not have seen in a game setting
5239961 i was thinking about running before i even made the catch
5239962 im thinking about everything you cant do nothing without the ball im trying to make a play instead of focusing on little things
5239963 the most important thing on offense is to secure the ball first whether it be a handoff catching a pass or fielding a punt
5239964 as far as special teams ive never done it i want to go out and prove to myself that i can do it
5239965 special teams is all about effort its a one play kind of situation
5239966 you dont get to line up on second down and remake anything special teams requires you to go 100 percent
5239967 watching the films what i see is a lot of guys here learning the system working to get into place
5239968 its preseason right now and its trial and error were going to get better by the time the season comes
5239969 the lanes on the punt returns you have to be patient back there im seeing some lanes but it seems hard to get to them but im going to stay patient and work on it
5239970 i know they are great fans but there are also people i will say for a minute that i read message boards and got caught up in that whole thing
5239971 that even put more stress on me just worrying about what people thought about me people say a lot of times i dont care what people think about me me personally i dont care how people perceive me when they look at my hair but i like people to think great things about shawn andrews but you cant please the world
5239972 who wants to spend money on a guy whos not been here who knows if hes going to show up caused all this confusion i wouldnt have bought a ticket to see me either
5239973 i felt at some point i would have to face the fans so i figured it might as well be now
5239974 the line is kind of everything is organized so that its kind of fly by but some people lean in and say positive things im dealing with it keep your head up it really makes me feel good that im not the only one going through it
5239975 i kind of feel like some of the fans are going through it with me those that are admitting it those that know that they have it
5239976 i was kind of pessimistic how my teammates would receive me
5239977 there were a lot of rumors i admitted to my teammates i created a lot of those rumors at the time coach andy reid didnt know the truth people were saying it was really about his contract didnt want to play football anymore and i admit that i created those rumors just out of a lot of frustration and didnt care what people thought
5239978 you have a guy whos quick tempered whos to the point where i really didnt care anymore thats not the real me i just didnt realize what i was going through
5239979 a few weeks ago was the first time ive ever opened up to anybody about anything that was part of the reason
5239980 coach reid after he realized that shawn andrews did have a serious problem he was very positive about the situation hes a funny guy he helps you laugh tries to make the situation better
5239981 i just wanted to talk to those guys face to face man to man
5239982 i just felt like whether they believed me or not i did my part in my mind i hope they believe me i think for the most part they do and i hope they respect me if they dont they will
5239983 i really cant put it into words id like their respect as a player but id like their respect as a person first life is short and there are a lot more things i can count that are more important than football
5239984 like i said i had a million and one thoughts going through my head
5239985 i just lost my love for a lot of things i didnt know which direction i was headed football wasnt even a thought
5239986 i would love to play against the patriots i mean it feels good to be back and around my teammates
5239987 you dont get that camaraderie in too many other places

5239992 ive been burgled twice in the last eight years ive had my car stolen and i was on my bike the other day and this white van had been following me stopping and starting this was very late at night about midnight i was coming back from some dinner
5239993 i got rather nervous about it so i turned down a road i dont normally go down and i slowed down and sort of pulled in behind a line of parked cars and as this van drove by this hand came out and just bashed me in the back with the aim of pushing me in front of the car luckily i managed to put the brakes on
5239994 daten d rfen f r werbezwecke nur verwendet werden wenn der betroffene ausdr cklich eingewilligt hat
5239995 for me it confirms to all these doubters that i am fit enough to do this
5239996 leave me alone now and let me get on with it
5239997 it was forced upon me at the time because my knee had deteriorated to such an extent that i couldnt walk 10 yards without stumbling
5239998 people think he cant possibly think of going back into bullfighting after a heart bypass but all i can say to that is what is the knee operation for
5239999 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good
