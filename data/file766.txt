7660023 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
7660024 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7660025 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n
7660026 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
7660027 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7660028 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7660029 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7660030 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7660037 in our view this data is a strong indicator that performance of the mobile carriers network is affecting the iphone 3g more than the handset itself
7660038 i ts highly unlikely that apple is going to wave a magic wand and say 3g problems be gone with a software update before apple can make such a claim it needs to wait for all of its carriers to optimize 3g network behavior in terms of number of towers how theyre positioned and how much bandwidth each tower can handle
7660039 0 speeds meaning they dropped off of 3g entirely were at amp t customers in the u s out of more than 1 600 survey participants from the u s 63 reported speeds of 0 only 80 participants worldwide reported speeds of 0
7660040 the nice part about technology as with most things is that mature platforms fragment
7660041 so we have these youth optimized devices that we really have never seen just a few years ago
7660042 whats nice about it is that it appeals to a demographic that doesnt have a whole lot of money in their pocket

7660054 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7660055 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7660056 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7660057 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7660058 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

7660063 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7660064 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7660065 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7660066 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7660067 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7660068 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7660069 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7660070 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7660071 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

7660078 recognition would also be inconsistent with unanimously approved united nations security resolutions that russia has consistently voted for in the past
7660079 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support and also consulting on how these leaders in the region see the future playing out
7660080 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia

7660086 the relationship between player and umpire is not really good at the moment and if theyre going to start giving free kicks for this sort of stuff the umpire is much better off to come up to the player give him a pat on the backside and say look listen michael settle down and dont be demonstrative or im going to have to give you a free kick

7660109 for me its not an issue because weve just got to get the best person for the job and if some people perceive it that way well theres nothing we can do about it
7660110 people can have that perception but at the end of the day weve got to get this club on the right footing
7660111 we got to a point where we identified who we wanted and it was just a matter of going back sitting down and really putting on the table where were at as a football club
7660112 chose not to ask why george w bush was the first us president to attend the olympics on foreign soil and why the state department last april took china off its list of nations that commit human rights violations
7660113 t he people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire them or to reassign them without individual cause
7660114 found to be handling or deciding cases based on politics and not based on what the law and facts require
7660115 lucinda fredericks round was slightly disappointing in her time not taking anything away from the fact she secured our position by having the two very good clear show jumping rounds before having to send megan jones out
7660116 it was almost fate we really had the germans beaten the only phase where we let them slip ahead which really cost us was the cross country we shouldnt have let it happen
7660117 i think that psychologically if we had stayed on top after the cross country it might have been a different story
7660118 im fit enough to continue coaching the australian eventing team i think ive outlasted most other people and im older than them
7660119 i would love to do it if my health holds out but my plan from yesterday evening the night after the australians claimed team silver was how we can beat the germans or whoever in london
7660120 we have to be over in europe and competing at this level
7660121 ive had so much experience jumping decent courses and strong tracks this year and it gives you that good positive feeling when you are against all of these riders every few weeks
7660122 i think that dressage is going through a very similar point in time in australia
7660123 i know this sounds obscene but we import more frozen semen from the dressage world which is mainly germany than any other country in the world
7660124 its only a matter of time before we have more high class horses per rider than any other country in the world
7660125 now you marry that in with a nation that is basically a group of sporting freaks and i dont think you need to be einstein to work out that the gold medals that have become nearly an australian inheritance in eventing we are going to do that in dressage
7660126 we hear about climate change as a political issue an environmental issue and an economic issue we want to press the point that this is a moral issue
7660127 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd
7660128 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help make our case
7660129 the group that was dealing with preparation for the iraq war came back and said theyre no longer interested
7660130 if the president wants to go to war our job is to find the intelligence to allow him to do so
7660131 russia does not have in its possession any trustworthy data that supports the existence of nuclear weapons or any weapons of mass destruction in iraq and we have not received any such information from our partners as yet this fact has also been supported by the information sent by the cia to the us congress
7660132 there may be a difference of perspective about weapons of mass destruction there is one certain way to find out and that is to let the inspectors back in to do their job that is the key point on which we are both agreed
7660133 there is actually an agreement concluded between the two parties over the definite date which is 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7660134 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7660135 were optimistic that iraq and the us can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals for us troops to continue to return on success based on conditions on the ground and allow iraqi forces to provide security for a sovereign iraq
7660136 a growing number of small businesses are looking to mobile technology to run their business

7660138 given the virtual nature of our interactions iphone support helps us be more productive
7660139 while waiting for an appointment i was able to check quickbooks online using my iphone to look up parents with open balances and send them an e mail reminder to pay their bill

7660169 jesus calls us to get down and dirty and to give up our pretensions of greatness defined by fame carefree living or accomplishment
7660170 contrary to popular opinion greatness is truly defined by the humble and often hidden actions of a person who has given up on coming out on top
7660171 it is not about having its about being living a great life is actually walking a difficult but rewarding path of self sacrifice and inconvenience driven by a greater concern and love for others

7660186 el gran acuerdo es hacernos cargo entre todos del problema de la inseguridad eliminar las discrepancias con el pretexto de las atribuciones diferenciadas que tienen los gobiernos de los distintos rdenes y de los diferentes actores pol ticos
7660187 de nada sirve intensificar la prevenci n si a quien le toca juzgar y calificar los delitos protege y apoya a los delincuentes y por negligencia u omisi n los deja regresar a las calles

7660322 occorre scegliere da che parte stare e subito non si possono delegare valori come giustizia e legalit allo stato perch lo stato siamo anche noi
7660323 non bisogna mai avere paura non permettere che pochi delinquenti condizionino la vita di noi cittadini onesti che siamo la stragrande maggioranza questa una terra bellissima mio padre ha continuato ad amarla fino allultimo quando ha rifiutato la scorta perch diceva che in calabria si sentiva al sicuro invece stato ucciso proprio nella sua campo calabro a pochi passi da casa quando si dalla parte del giusto non si pu avere paura questo il pi grande insegnamento che egli mi abbia lasciato
7660324 even though im dropping this in the streets i see rappers online and it matters whats said online you go to mtvnews com and see what they saying on mixtape monday fans complain about everything they complain about weezy when he does right when he do wrong same thing with kanye and everybody me and my boys went to all these web sites and we took a whole list of everything everybody said bad about chamillionaire i did a rap like im the person sitting at the computer typing and saying bad stuff about chamilllionaire its some little kid thats on the internet hes young hes getting all this stuff hes saying about me his mother comes in and asks him did you take your medication are you on those porno sites again im rapping like im him in his voice

7660332 i was so stunned i didnt know what to do
7660333 we dont talk about it a lot but yeah it does happen
7660334 we dont know exactly how or why its happening and the senator wont talk about it he usually insists that people keep it quiet and just report it to their pastor or priest
7660335 there is something developing here that im not sure any of us fully understands

7660340 what a bunch of sore losers i didnt win the book either but im not here whining about the test questions
7660341 msnbc has turned into a commentary for liberals and they dont even try to be non biased
7660342 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7660343 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7660344 han comenzado las negociaciones finales para determinar el precio de la empresa nosotros tenemos toda la disposici n de llegar a un acuerdo ellos enviaron unos negociadores y manifestaron que tambi n quieren llegar a un acuerdo lo m s r pido posible

7660346 when the numbers were high i would get stopped in the street maybe once a week
7660347 now that the viewing figures are lower on the tv everywhere i go someone will come up to me and say what a huge fan they are that just tells me that people watch the show in a more modern way and that it has reached its sort of critical mass
7660348 in fact i dont think we ever go into space
7660349 its really about big business the machinations and the subterfuge that go on inside of it when you have something that is groundbreaking and could change the nature of life and the future
7660350 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7660351 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7660352 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7660353 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7660354 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7660355 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7660356 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7660357 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7660358 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7660359 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images

7660363 to begin with let us take the following motto literature is love now we can continue
7660364 i can be changed by what happens to me but i refuse to be reduced by it
7660365 style is knowing who you are what you want to say and not giving a damn
7660366 perfume is like love you can never get enough of it
7660367 yesterday is history tomorrow is mystery today is a gift
7660368 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
7660369 im not sure if this has been confirmed already or not but i was told the new dashboard would arrive in november
7660370 we have not yet announced the timing of the fall update
7660371 i think theyll have to extend the length of debate to 2 3 hours
7660372 an open source project that turns out to be a code dump burns its users who may sour on the whole open source experience
7660373 whether its paid pr pros taking the lead or contributors wearing the pr hat someone has to speak for the foss projects or theyll be ignored
7660374 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7660375 we have a chance to get peyton activated and out to practice so well see how that goes
7660376 i think well ease him in and see how he practices and what hes able to do
7660377 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7660378 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7660379 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7660380 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7660381 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games

7660391 the nice part about technology as with most things is that mature platforms fragment
7660392 so we have these youth optimized devices that we really have never seen just a few years ago
7660393 whats nice about it is that it appeals to a demographic that doesnt have a whole lot of money in their pocket
7660394 these kids dont have 200 or 300 dollars to spend on a phone although theyd like to the blitz is cool enough that you dont have to be branded as the person using the cheap phone in school
7660395 the blitz looks like a nice addition to the lineup and really optimized in a way that this demographic uses their devices where messaging and music is as important as phone calls
7660396 naturally if companies are going to get more involved they need to earn some kind of return this is the heart of creative capitalism its not just about doing more corporate philanthropy or asking companies to be more virtuous its about giving them a real incentive to apply their expertise in new ways making it possible to earn a return while serving the people who have been left out

7660407 we are not suggesting one way or the other as to what the officers were truly doing in this case we are just saying it was error for the district court not to examine whether there was a factual basis for the police to believe they had probable cause to get the search warrant
7660408 were still trying to reconcile the different things we do and cultivate what were individually good at into something thats bigger than the sum of its parts
7660409 when were all playing and its working it becomes this separate entity and thats still the thing that were chasing
7660410 on the last few records we concentrated so much on the craft of the songwriting and arrangements that we started losing some of the live spontaneity that the five of us created on stage so on this album instead of doing the usual pre production process where we really worked out the songs before taking them into the studio we decided to go straight into the studio and do the songwriting there we recorded all the parts as we were working them out and then build the songs from there wed find a cool little pocket and jam on it or thered be a drumbeat or a guitar part that was really happening and wed take the best part of that and use it as the foundation of the song
7660411 that was a completely new way of working for us
7660412 but it was also taking what we do live and bringing it into the studio for a long time we thought of the studio as a completely different creative process than playing live because weve never had much luck in trying to incorporate the stuff we do live onto a record but this time all the live improvisation we were doing in the studihttp artists download com html js dl music htmlarea popups fullscreen html longdescriptiono inspired the songs
7660413 the main thing that we wanted to emphasize on this record was melody and i think that that aspect of it turned out really well
7660414 the guys took a real risk in trusting me to run with that
7660415 im going to try and see if i can get
7660416 we fully expect that both the number of suspected and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be tested
7660417 if they the opposition decide to be spoilers then we will seek to negotiate with the minor parties to make sure these essential budget bills are carried
7660418 i think people are concerned certainly theres about 20 000 children not enrolled in school and if children are not in the system theyve got no chance in life
7660419 there was a very good discussion a lot of points put on the table which the ministers took on board and i guess that will formulate the basis of further discussion to caucus
7660420 it wasnt a liquid market particularly as its the last week of the northern summer
7660421 its difficult to put a story around the price action in the last 12 hours
7660422 maybe ana lucia busted l a based ghost hustler miles during her pre crash lapd days and now the freighter folkster is seeing visions of the late tailie on the island
7660423 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7660424 i think i have a much higher iq than you do
7660425 the american people cannot afford to keep bailing out big businesses lenders investment bankers and brokers who made big mistakes
7660426 fannie mae and freddie mac were set up by congress to subsidize the housing market but theyve lost 11 billion in past months and just announced another 3 1 billion in losses the companies say that they have enough cash reserves but some analysts believe they may have 1 trillion in bad mortgages between them their stock prices have been plunging and they are cutting dividends it wont be long before they put their hands out for the subsidies authorized by congress in the recent housing bail out bill
7660427 both organizations have started to cut back on buying loans they also are becoming more careful in which loans they buy this is what they should have been doing years ago but congress was too busy using them to try to win votes
7660428 before the treasury department provides a dime to either fannie mae or freddie mac it needs to put together a plan for restructuring and fully privatizing both companies
7660429 after that no more federal support under any circumstances they would have to live within their means just as we normally expect individuals and businesses to do
7660430 finally the coming financial crisis with fannie mae and freddie mac should become a wake up call for americans to elect leaders who will put the governments financial house in order
7660431 its time senators mccain and obama take a break from arguing over ads featuring paris hilton and britney spears
7660432 they should stop impugning each others patriotism long enough to address real issues of importance to voters such as the looming housing bailout crisis
7660433 school is supposed to start tomorrow i have two little ones who i had to drop off to a friend of mines house because obviously we cant get into the house
7660434 when the police first came to the door i thought you know three teenagers at home could be any of them but you know family tendencies leaning toward heidi
7660435 i was laughing a lot when they took the picture
7660436 no official announcement has been made about pradeep gandhis return to the party fold
7660437 election control cell being set up by the state party headquarters
7660438 when i went back to him and asked what he said i said excuse me what did you say he grabbed me by the shoulders and laughed
7660439 he didnt say anything i asked did you call me an uncle tom he never said anything at that point i proceeded to call him a few things then i walked away
7660440 theres this feeling out here that weve somehow betrayed the race
7660441 the attitude from obama supporters is that theyre going to beat you into submission and make you admit you were wrong for supporting hillary
7660442 i used the same litmus test and this time it happened to be hillary clinton i feel confidant and have no shame whatsoever its not like she was an insignificant candidate
7660443 i am not inspiring or inciting riots i am dreaming of riots in denver
7660444 sparking controversy again after he made comments that appear to call for riots in denver during the democratic national convention this summer
7660445 we do hopefully the right thing for the sake of this country were the only one in charge of our affairs we dont farm out our defense if we elect democrats and riots in denver at the democratic convention will see to it we dont elect democrats and thats the best damn thing that can happen to this country as far as i can think
7660446 anyone who would call for riots in an american city has clearly lost their bearings
7660447 im waiting im looking forward to fight him kj noons inside elitexc everybody had the chance and lost but im here im with six victories two inside elite and want to face him i came to get his belt i dont know if hell accept a fight with me they offered nick diaz and he didnt wanted the event is negotiating to try to put me to fight i hope he accepts it
7660448 the champion of the event picking the opponents the champ has to fight whoever the event wants nick diaz has qualities to steal his belt and i want to get into this battle too if you have the belt you need to be prepared to fight everybody every fighter that goes to elitexc wants to fight for the belt nobody signs a contract thinking about fighting the worst opponent
7660449 this years rankings show that market events rather than just advertising alone can be critical drivers to brand websites
7660450 pharmaceutical companies need to ensure that brand websites contain the latest most accurate content possible and can be found relatively easily by physicians using search engines to research pharmaceutical information
7660451 pdx is pleased to be the first aggregator of multi pharmacy electronic prescription records to enter into a strategic relationship with google this new agreement will allow our pharmacy customers both chain and independents the ability to integrate client prescription history into google health at the users request
7660452 we believe users should have access to their prescription history and medical records and should be able to organize this information in one safe and centralized place
7660453 working with pdx will enable several nationwide pharmacies to connect with google health giving millions of patients access to their own personal data
7660454 you look at planet of the apes they squeezed five films out of that
7660455 you just hope to god you can kind of secure everybody and everybodys available at the right time this is probably the biggest challenge
7660456 its a real kick you know when you kind of weirdly become a part of the zeitgeist or the things that you make are travelling on other roads and making other things click
7660457 we were just kind of floored at the great embrace
7660458 its been a slow rolling thunder from the premiere and because of the life on dvd and people passing it around amongst themselves and sending it to friends in germany and alabama
7660459 its developed its own little mythologies and so we want to do the fans proud and make a kick ass follow up

7660477 the amount of carbon we can put into the soil is staggering
7660478 with eight billion people were going to have to start getting interested in soil
7660479 were simply not going to be able to keep treating it like dirt
7660480 i have known darin since the late 1980s and worked with him during his tenure at kpmg while i served as the chief financial officer at parker and parsley petroleum company his technical background and training both in public accounting and the energy industry provide the perfect complementary skill set to our management team we are delighted to welcome darin and his family back to midland

7660482 health care costs are such an important component of financial security for people as they age
7660483 we wanted to get a sense of whether people recognized the difference in health insurance costs and how it could affect them if they were considering a move
7660484 we didnt think people would change their minds about moving but its definitely something they should consider i think people understand there are different cost of living issues from place to place but there is less awareness about costs concerning health care issues
7660485 when retiring you need several hundred thousand dollars at a minimum just to buy insurance for the rest of your life even though at some point youre going to become eligible for medicare
7660486 you cant get medicare until youre 65 unless youre disabled and most people retire before that age these days so if youre retiring before the age of 65 and not automatically eligible for medicare it is imperative that you think through all of the costs associated with getting health coverage before turning in your retirement notice
7660487 a lot of the consideration will have to do with a persons comfort with the medicare advantage plan and whether they would be comfortable with the networks in the advantage plan of a particular state
7660488 its important that people understand the networks and doctors available with each plan that way they can make a choice that makes sense for their needs and preferences people have to do the research
7660489 the most important implication of the house panels decision to strip this ban from their legislation is that it will end the appearance that doctors are taking gifts in return for recommending expensive drugs to their patients to the benefit of pharmaceutical companies
7660490 it is good that doctors will not be receiving gifts and meals from pharmaceutical companies that are trying to sell their products but i dont think doctors receiving these small favors are contributing much to the rising cost of caring for sick patients
7660491 will do very little to rein in health care spending because it is not directed at the main causes that are driving up costs in the first place
7660492 pharmaceuticals represent about 10 percent of our nations health care spending
7660493 while political leaders focus a disproportionate amount of their attention on reducing costs and spending in this one sector a good argument can be made that in actuality we arent spending enough on drugs
7660494 treating diabetes heart disease and high blood pressure properly with medications for example can avoid amputations heart attacks and stroke procedures and conditions that cost far more than the treatment necessary to simply prevent them in the first place
7660495 massachusetts lawmakers will be disappointed if they think this bill will lower health care costs
7660496 may sound good in a press release to their local newspaper but the real world effect on rising health care spending will be close to zero
7660497 have an impact on the employers who are required to provide health insurance plans
7660498 providing health care is already a burden for employers particularly small employers who are subject to state regulations
7660499 the additional regulations that massachusetts puts on health insurance plans will make the policies more expensive and even more burdensome for small employers
7660500 rather than allowing individuals to make their own decisions elected officials have dictated the structure and benefits of health insurance policies through legislative mandates
7660501 unfortunately these mandates arbitrarily inflate the cost of health insurance making even a basic plan too expensive for consumers and forcing them to rely on the government to provide these benefits or forego coverage altogether
7660502 that is what a mandate does it forces someone to pay even if they dont want it it also reduces flexibility in the market
7660503 any time we add a new mandate it increases the cost for employers and consumers
7660504 and that runs counter to the need to control health care costs
7660505 incorporates the use of health information technology and quality measures to create a safe patient centered quality driven sustainable health care system for medicaid recipients and low income uninsured citizens
7660506 psns also have substantial participating ownership by a hospital and or provider group s creating a financial incentive for providers to invest in the long term health of beneficiaries
7660507 the medicaid reform committee will counsel the agency as it moves to implement this patient centered model of care called louisiana health first
7660508 our citizens deserve health care that meets the unique needs of different individuals and different communities the leaders we have chosen to advise the implementation of louisiana health first will help ensure it becomes a model for innovative sustainable health care
7660509 like all good ideas everything depends on the particulars and how it is implemented
7660510 if correctly handled a medical home system can be an effective patient centered health care option
7660511 i would hope louisiana would consider recognizing concierge physicians primary care doctors who offer extensive services and focus on individual patients as medical homes
7660512 these physicians do everything a medical home is supposed to do but without the bureaucracy of some of the medical home models
7660513 the evidence is growing that medical homes and concierge physicians save more money than they cost by helping patients better control their chronic conditions and avoid expensive hospital stays
7660514 cbpp fails to understand the movement to next generation insurance products with rewards and incentives for wellness prevention and compliance with physician established treatment plans
7660515 the new georgia laws eliminate state government taxes that only increase costs and the number of uninsured
7660516 the incentives are too small to encourage people and companies to buy additional or new health care
7660517 its not to say that there wont be anybody that gets the benefit of this but its going to be very modest
7660518 to argue that legislation that lowers the cost of health insurance will not encourage more people to purchase health insurance ignores the fundamental laws of economics
7660519 roughly three quarters of all health care spending in georgia is related to individuals with chronic disease
7660520 providing financial incentives and rewards for healthy behavior will not only lower the cost of health insurance for those individuals but will hopefully reduce the number of georgians developing chronic disease in the future
7660521 the study completely ignores two major accomplishments of the legislation eliminating tax discrimination at the state level for those who do not have access to employer provided insurance but instead purchase health insurance themselves and the elimination of georgias prohibition on rewards and incentives for healthy behavior and compliance with disease management plans
7660522 the georgia legislation retains all existing state mandates and consumer protections
7660523 the direction georgia has taken is to ensure the uninsured an affordable comprehensive insurance plan
7660524 it is no longer the amount of money one pays in premiums now it includes the financial rewards and incentives to offset premiums and deductibles and to provide additions to increase health savings accounts
7660525 for the first time hsa eligible plans can have any deductible gap filled in by good health behaviors and health treatment compliance
7660526 hsa eligible plans can no longer be criticized as only for the young healthy and wealthy a new generation of products is on the way and georgia is leading the way
7660527 both parts of the new georgia law are good for consumers and taxpayers because they put money back in the pockets of individuals giving them the power to make choices about how they spend or save it
7660528 one of the primary critiques in the cbpp study is that there are no subsidies for low income georgians
7660529 although this is an important segment of the uninsured due to the expense of addressing this part of the population it will likely require cooperation with the federal government
7660530 this plan was clearly designed to address the large and growing number of georgians who have recently been priced out of the market those with chronic disease individuals without access to employer provided insurance and the young and healthy who choose not to purchase insurance
7660531 our next challenge will be those who cannot afford health insurance without some form of subsidy and those who are uninsurable
7660532 first allow consumers to shop for insurance across state lines by creating a more competitive environment we would very quickly lower the cost of premiums second give tax credits to employers and consumers equal to the cost of their premiums
7660533 the more we get government out of the industry and the more choice we give consumers the better off everyone will be free market solutions always work better to solve problems than the tiny band aid approaches of bureaucrats and politicians
7660534 new georgia and florida health plans unlikely to reduce ranks of uninsured
7660535 the governor claims he will strengthen hb 824 with an amendatory veto and executive order but it is apparent he is trying to bypass the legislative process rather than work towards real reform some of his proposed changes have merit and should be debated as separate bills in the meantime the general assembly should reject his veto and put the most important reform in state statutes
7660536 hiv should be a non partisan issue prevention information is essential for everyone and for those that are politically engaged they should also be aware of the public health threat that hiv presents
7660537 after more than 25 years fighting hiv in this country we have failed to establish a national plan and have failed to educate americans on how to remain safe public funding for domestic hiv prevention programs has consistently been reduced during the past five years while the rate of infections has grown

7660541 it is not a problem because there is plenty of space it will be moved a couple of hundred meters yards further down
7660542 in older times shepherds used to take sheep and goats there and dunk them in
7660543 the fact that no such beach existed had caused problems between dog owners and people who did not want dogs in the area
7660544 lhomme est le terme unique do il faut partir et auquel il faut tout ramener

7660558 here was a candidate for the presidency of the united states asked for his position on one of the central moral and legal questions of our time and this was the best he could offer
7660559 listening to my opponent at saddleback you would never know that this is a politician who long since left behind any middle ground on the abortion issue
7660560 for a man who talks so often about hope doesnt offer much of it in meeting this great challenge to the conscience of america
7660561 his extreme advocacy in favor of partial birth abortion and his refusal to provide medical care for babies surviving abortion should be of grave concern to reasonable people of goodwill on both sides of this issue
7660562 there was already a law in place in illinois that said that you always have to supply life saving treatment to any infant under any circumstances
7660563 this bill actually was designed to overturn obamas choice of biden for vice president may help more in governing than campaigning how much did hillary clintons historic run really break the glass ceiling
7660564 traditionally we have innovated effectively on the web and in some other areas but we havent made a focused investment and taken a focused approach to innovation
7660565 its something that we decided we wanted to do more deliberately
7660566 we think we can get a great deal of competitive advantage from it while providing better service to our members and providers
7660567 ive been here since 71 and they started fixing that house up that mexican family it was looking better every week or every other week and then somebody come along and do that
7660568 its a tragic reminder of what happened every time we see that house we see it daily we remember the kids out in the yard playing so i mean everybody else goes by they see a house that people were killed in we see a house that people lived in
7660569 i think it was set just to get rid of it
7660570 the lender selection process was surprisingly competitive even in light of the current financial markets
7660571 the extremely low leverage and diversity of markets really enticed all the primary players ultimately metlife won the financing based upon a combination of factors that included a rapid rate lock and streamlined closing process which allowed the borrowers to capitalize on the current interest rate environment

7660599 how they vote is a more personal decision they want to have their chance to vote for me that is what traditionally happens some people are having to make up their minds because there are arguments pulling them both ways

7660618 we know from previous research that the uninsured have poor outcomes on a number of measures and they are less likely to seek care when they need it
7660619 but we know less about what actually happens when the uninsured try to obtain health care in various settings and more specifically how institutions deal with these patients
7660620 we found that the public institution was the most open to seeing patients in a variety of settings by contrast the for profit institution would really only see patients in the emergency department
7660621 the for profit basically took its losses and seemed to say well just see these folks in the emergency department we wont work too hard to get money from them and so be it
7660622 and not surprisingly the not for profit fell in between
7660623 as we move forward in the political process we have to recognize that this is essentially an unmanaged group a group of people who dont know what theyre going to get they are getting care from a set of institutions that are uncomfortable and unsure about what it is they want to provide

7660653 i think people now have a better idea of what its like to do a long time in a penitentiary as opposed to what they might have imagined in their own mind but with dna and witnesses coming forward years later it has changed peoples minds about the death penalty
7660654 there are so many new people involved and eager to work and work for change that i think its just pure excitement that were at a tipping point

7660697 the outcome of the last 2 elections has saddened me
7660698 its killing him to watch what has happened over the past eight years its been torture to watch the slow unraveling of so much of what his administration achieved
7660699 its actually a very difficult place to go sailing in theres two winds a gradient wind and a sea breeze and its very subtle
7660700 thierry pepponet matadors tactician and myself spent quite a lot of time before the start trying to fathom it out and it wasnt easy
7660701 i think if we get our act together this week we can be on the podium again the boat and team have the potential but you also need that little bit of luck to get the show rolling we are quite confident but not overly so as the competition is very tough but today we had some good practice starts and good speed so i think we have a good chance we will certainly work very hard to make it happen
7660702 the only shame is having done a half decent job today the whole thing will be very different tomorrow
7660703 were one of the most improved boats we were average to good at the start of the year and weve been getting stronger and stronger as the years gone on weve made lots of improvements including our techniques weve been a lot more active with our coaching we kind of knew we had to step it up weve got an eye on the regatta wed always be looking for a top three at the regatta and theres a reasonable chance that we could be a really strong boat in the audi medcup circuit overall as well two regattas to go and were in fifth spot but mean machine have dropped and out and were not too far behind
7660704 matador really wants to win this regatta which is tough on me
7660705 they finished second in the breitling regatta and they want a better result so that just leaves winning it is a lot of pressure but i like that and i am sure all the people on board and the boat can do it we will do all we can to achieve that goal
7660706 this of any of the events had us the most worried since it was such an unknown trying to get weather data or any historical perspective has been really tough but im pretty sure everyone has been through the same thing
7660707 getting good boatspeed is a never ending battle and identifying modes and today the main focus was getting everybody back communicating so we can start the team dynamics again the afterguard is made up of such diverse personalities so that was our biggest focus we never use our race sails for the practice race so are always maybe a touch off the pace
7660708 if you cant be with the one you love then love the one youre with
7660709 play golf with you at some course that we shouldnt have a chance in hell playing

7660733 i have administered botox to some patients suffering from headaches facial pain and due to chronic muscle spasm i have found it sometimes very helpful since the drug is administered locally there are no systemic side effects like fatigue and sedation as there are with orally administered muscle relaxant drugs botox injections sometimes have to be repeated to maintain a therapeutic effect patients should note this
7660734 pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage
7660735 viewing chronic nonmalignant pain in strictly disease model terms is the moral equivalent of kicking the refrigerator when the tv does not work

7660737 this agreement makes the sec the most widely distributed conference in the country
7660738 the bottom line here is that fans of sec football will have more access to games and better distribution than they ever have in the past
7660739 its not hard to figure why wed want to be involved with it given the quality of sec sports for 15 more years
7660740 one of the reasons that this league has developed into one of the top leagues in the country is because we have tremendous exposure
7660741 i think we had the best exposure from a tv standpoint in our last contract and this one is only going to enhance it more
7660742 but we were busy making the caucasus safe from russian imperialism
7660743 moskva has today departed toward the black sea fleets naval training range to check its radio controlled weapons and onboard communications systems

7660752 it is disappointing to see news articles continue to link two separate issues pricing through competitive bidding and fraud prevention fraud prevention mechanisms are different than the price setting program delayed by congress
7660753 if the federal government wants to get serious about preventing fraud and preventing theft of taxpayer dollars it should use tools like accreditation more aggressively and use its ample existing authority much more effectively

7660755 the candidates we elect in 2008 will face crucial decisions about the path of our nations fiscal policy these decisions go well beyond what may be needed to balance the budget in the short term campaigns are the best time for voters to find out how candidates plan to deal with the looming fiscal challenge or whether they have even thought about it at all it is crucial that voters be able to assess whether the candidates appreciate the magnitude of the looming fiscal challenge the need for trade offs and the importance of acting sooner rather than later
7660756 some candidates will be tempted to tell the voters what they think they want to hear rather than what they need to hear its up to the voters to make each campaign a pander free zone for our part we hope these questions will help in that effort we also encourage candidates to show initiative by bringing up these issues themselves without waiting for the voters to demand answers that is what real leadership is about
7660757 we spent every saturday on a basketball court somewhere watching my brother play

7660772 the ninth graders have rooms unlike we did last year
7660773 i just think its very important to not just toss them into the flames so to say because we find that it can be overwhelming so theyre not really segregated because theyre still very much a part of the high school
7660774 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7660775 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7660776 neither one of them can win but both of them can make the other lose
7660777 i just dont see how theres going to be any stand down by either one of them thats going to turn the campaign in another direction

7660791 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7660792 these findings provide further evidence that the health system is falling short of where it needs to be to ensure health and economic security
7660793 we need a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance available

7660829 the candidates we elect in 2008 will face crucial decisions about the path of our nations fiscal policy these decisions go well beyond what may be needed to balance the budget in the short term campaigns are the best time for voters to find out how candidates plan to deal with the looming fiscal challenge or whether they have even thought about it at all it is crucial that voters be able to assess whether the candidates appreciate the magnitude of the looming fiscal challenge the need for trade offs and the importance of acting sooner rather than later
7660830 some candidates will be tempted to tell the voters what they think they want to hear rather than what they need to hear its up to the voters to make each campaign a pander free zone for our part we hope these questions will help in that effort we also encourage candidates to show initiative by bringing up these issues themselves without waiting for the voters to demand answers that is what real leadership is about

7660841 we are concerned about what appears to be a drive toward minimum standards by our airline and others
7660842 this is not a safety issue this more union politics than anything else
7660843 all the airlines are doing is asking the crews to be vigilant

7660870 the nice part about technology as with most things is that mature platforms fragment
7660871 so we have these youth optimized devices that we really have never seen just a few years ago
7660872 whats nice about it is that it appeals to a demographic that doesnt have a whole lot of money in their pocket
7660873 these kids dont have 200 or 300 dollars to spend on a phone although theyd like to the blitz is cool enough that you dont have to be branded as the person using the cheap phone in school

7660879 this could extend itself well into 2009 with repercussions that could keep the country stagnant for two or three years
7660880 this event is especially exciting because over the past few years east passyunk avenue has revitalized into a place that is desirable to live work and play
7660881 at the moment we still dont know what the schedule of the weekend will be
7660882 we go there we havent tested we dont have any idea its going to be a night race its going to be the rainy season so its not exactly what you really want from a safety point of view

7660890 it hasnt gone unanswered in fact id say its been loudly answered
7660891 i dont think theres any question that russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia
7660892 theres no question that russia hasnt lived up to the cease fire agreement
7660893 were still trying to reconcile the different things we do and cultivate what were individually good at into something thats bigger than the sum of its parts
7660894 when were all playing and its working it becomes this separate entity and thats still the thing that were chasing
7660895 on the last few records we concentrated so much on the craft of the songwriting and arrangements that we started losing some of the live spontaneity that the five of us created on stage so on this album instead of doing the usual pre production process where we really worked out the songs before taking them into the studio we decided to go straight into the studio and do the songwriting there we recorded all the parts as we were working them out and then build the songs from there wed find a cool little pocket and jam on it or thered be a drumbeat or a guitar part that was really happening and wed take the best part of that and use it as the foundation of the song
7660896 that was a completely new way of working for us
7660897 but it was also taking what we do live and bringing it into the studio for a long time we thought of the studio as a completely different creative process than playing live because weve never had much luck in trying to incorporate the stuff we do live onto a record but this time all the live improvisation we were doing in the studihttp artists download com html js dl music htmlarea popups fullscreen html longdescriptiono inspired the songs
7660898 the main thing that we wanted to emphasize on this record was melody and i think that that aspect of it turned out really well
7660899 the guys took a real risk in trusting me to run with that

7660918 i think gold is finding its base here its mostly technical support holding prices above 820 any dips below 820 are seen as a buying opportunity
7660919 i guess the 800 psychological level support will come into play again i believe physical demand for gold is likely to remain good and perhaps the shortage may support the market a bit
7660920 if we start moving below 810 we will probably move to 800 very soon and perhaps gold could retest to the 770s again

7660946 the wars in iraq and afghanistan grind forward with their terrible human toll even as the press and many americans play who gets thrown off the island with barack obama coalition forces carried out an airstrike that killed up to 95 afghan civilians in western afghanistan on friday 50 of them children president hamid karzai said and the mounting bombing raids and widespread detentions of afghans are rapidly turning afghanistan into the mirror image of iraq but these very real events which will have devastating consequences over the next few months and years are largely ignored by us we prefer to waste our time on the trivia and gossip that swallow up air time and do nothing to advance our understanding of either the campaign or the wars fought in our name as the conflict in afghanistan has intensified so has the indiscriminate use of airstrikes including fridays which took place in the azizabad area of shindand district in herat province the airstrike was carried out after afghan and coalition soldiers were ambushed by insurgents while on a patrol targeting a known taliban commander in herat the u s military said hundreds of afghans shouting anti u s slogans staged angry street protests on saturday in azizabad to protest the killings and karzai condemned the airstrike
7660947 if you let yourself get frustrated by something like this its just going to affect you when you get back
7660948 ive got to look at the positives it could have been worse and im going to be back this season im just kind of going day to day with it and trying to get better
7660949 im pleased with my performance and obviously i feel there is room for improvement
7660950 i believe there is room for improvement in every part of my game i think i have gotten better at many things i try to take coaching and listen to them and do what they say and just improve a little bit per day on each thing and thats what i have been doing
7660951 ill get all of the treatment i can this week and ill be back out there next week
7660952 its still preseason ive still got time to recover and be back for monday night
7660953 its going to help me out and make my knee stronger my legs will be a little fresh and i can get out there and make some plays
7660954 i thought matt had a really good practice today and brian did a great job in the two minute drill
7660955 tom clements is a great quarterback coach he has got great advice and little tidbits to think about and then i will pull them aside and say hey this is what i am thinking about on this play after tom talks to them i think this will be a big week for them
7660956 i hate to sound like a broken record here but its a process
7660957 it takes time you talk to anybody that has ever played the position i am not disappointed at all with the path and the progress that these two young players have made
7660958 i am very happy with what i see theyll continue to get better and thats the most important thing they need reps they need to play in games and thats why well try to get them as many opportunities as we possibly can this thursday against tennessee
7660959 its a great opportunity for our young guys and really preseason to me is about finding out as much information as you possibly can not only about your team but about the individuals
7660960 this will give us a great look at a lot of guys that are fighting for jobs
7660961 i think the linebacker position is a position where you can move guys around fairly easily quite frankly
7660962 there are certain strengths each player has but we think both those guys are good players and should factor somewhere
7660963 all these young guys are going to play quite a bit
7660964 its competitive obviously between the final positions and practice squad i dont think any final decisions have been made on anything
7660965 we just want to see guys come out and make plays and have a minimum of mistakes
7660966 were looking to see who can do it under the big lights and make plays under the pressure of that situation
7660967 the most important report youre likely to read this year
7660968 the gp2 race winner is a red bull junior driver and believed to be the preferred choice for the companys motor sport advisor helmut marko
7660969 although bruno senna has been linked with the team berger said there were no plans to give him a similar test as he suggested that the outfit would likely only take one youngster next year
7660970 as alianora has pointed out in a thread on f1 fanatic the problem becomes one of choosing between the four possible penalties laid down in the regulations
7660971 that the stewards then chose to impose a penalty that was not included among those available under the rules underlines the fact that they were not interested in dealing with the offense in an equitable manner
7660972 once again i am led to the conclusion that the fia will always favor ferrari in controversial matters and will happily tinker with rules and regulations to keep the championship competitive
7660973 well it is not just the engine no this is a vicious industry and when you get nailed you can get nailed pretty quick we are in that situation we have a bit of a hole in the boat at the moment
7660974 we started the season off really well getting lots of points and being bloody reliable and things were going our way then it all started at the hockenheim test and we have struggled since then we havent been competitive in any session anywhere or any race
7660975 the relationships within the team have been deteriorating gradually in recent months and despite the long delayed arrival of the teams seamless gearshift we hear that they have now got to a point at which action is necessary it seems that this will boil down to a decision between team principal kolles and engineer mike gascoyne the team would probably be better off trying to manage its expectations and get everyone working together but neither kolles nor gascoyne seem very interested in compromise if there has to be a decision between the two it will be important to consider if there may be other ramifications and other people departing
7660976 it is being reported that financial giant credit suisse is leaving as title sponsor for the bmw sauber f1 team at the end of 2008 this is huge news as credit suisse has been associated with sauber for eight years it is also being suggested that credit suisses small ownership percentage is being bought by peter sauber leaving him with 20 and bmw the remaining 80 of ownership
7660977 a 25 turn race track situated on the coast of the mediterranean should have been enough to make for a fantastic weekend of racing instead we got a view reminiscent of shipyards on the tyne and a 100 minute procession that felt like the hungarian gp we were expecting three weeks ago

7660991 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected

7660993 you can play through the entire game without killing anything
7660994 its very challenging but its also very beneficial when the game initializes the relationships of other creatures or tribes or civilizations for the next level many of those relationships have to do with how aggressive those creatures perceive you to be
7660995 we werent thinking of the sims as a brand we were thinking of it as an offbeat computer game with spore we had the confidence that the players would always exceed our expectations if we gave them more creative control from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand
7660996 you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined
7660997 spore on almost any platform is going to be different and tied to the unique aspects of that platform
7660998 sitting in front of a console is very different from sitting in front of a pc whether youre using a mouse or a ps3 controller or a wii wand that right off the bat is arguing for a somewhat different design

7661006 sitting in front of a console is very different from sitting in front of a pc whether youre using a mouse or a ps3 controller or a wii wand that right off the bat is arguing for a somewhat different design
7661007 i dont think we could design a sequel to spore until the fans showed us what they like
7661008 i think theres going to be a fair amount of learning over the next few months whats important for me is what sort of stories the players are using the game to tell games that have the longest legs are the ones with the most narrative density
7661009 we agreed to expand the bilateral relations which have so far centered on economic and cultural exchanges to the political and security sectors we also agreed to meet more often in the future to exchange views on such issues

7661031 i have no idea who the picks are going to be because its not easy for faldo with monty not playing so great the last couple of months
7661032 he was a given pick before that but some guys thrive in the ryder cup and some guys dont and sometimes its better to give it to a guy who might not be playing that great but you pretty much know hes going to play well in a ryder cup
7661033 when that adrenaline gets going and the heart is pumping and all that you can play better than you have all year all of a sudden
7661034 the ryder cup is such a motivator and its so much fun and i think i would have monty there

7661043 wait what piazza retired when in may huh well too late to do anything about it now i guess
7661044 i dont know maybe i guess are you totally sure hes retired
7661045 i mean it would be kind of embarrassing to retire his number if hes still playing but if hes really done then yeah why not i barely remember him but he was supposed to be really good if i find the time ill get around to filing the paperwork or whatever it is you do when you retire a number now if youll excuse me i have a citys heart to crush

7661062 we risk committing a serious error by thinking that cheap information made universally available through electronic media fulfills the requirements of a democratic society for organized knowledge past generations had to win knowledge by using their wits and never took what they knew for granted recalling their labor and travail is if anything more important than ever if we are to distinguish what is truly novel about the information age from what is transient hype
7661063 promoters of the vaunted information age often forget that knowledge has always been about connecting people not collecting information

7661076 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7661077 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7661078 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7661079 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7661080 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7661081 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up

7661089 the adult entertainment industry is doing their part and we are thrilled that tera and evan have volunteered their time in order to remind parents to do their part by utilizing parental filtering options
7661090 evan and i take doing our part in the industry seriously to make the web a safer place for children we really believe what we say in the psa it is not for appearances but we take it to heart certain sects of our society and our government have the adult industry under a microscope using it as a scapegoat for all things unholy we have a social responsibility to keep adult entertainment restricted to adults we are so honored to have been approached by asacp and to be included in such an important message stormy daniels is not only one of my peers but a friend and i am proud to stand along side her in the name of something as important as the rta label if we dont police ourselves someone else will

7661102 its very hard to find good sushi chefs especially nowadays
7661103 its in our industrys interest to build a not for profit school
7661104 sushi is the core of japanese food culture in the u s but with the increase of sushi restaurants we are finding a lack of chefs and the techniques of local sushi chefs is declining
7661105 living in japan you know that youre not supposed to eat certain fish in certain seasons here anything goes people think raw fish is raw fish
7661106 seasoning and flavors are changing a lot compared to the traditional way sometimes its good sometimes its bad the good part is that we are dealing with american tastes so we should adjust flavors and some people do it well but some fish some sauces some vegetables dont match sometimes thats the bad part if i can teach how to make sushi well thats good
7661107 this was a surprising and exciting finding our direct observations appear to totally undermine a key rule that has withstood the test of time for over a century we will now make observations with a range of other chemicals and with other techniques to further elucidate the molecular basis for our observations text books will have to be rewritten to revise a rule that has been relied on for over a century advanced techniques such as the one we have developed should give much clearer insight into the action of a wide range of drug molecules which will be of significant interest to drug developers
7661108 the use of these levels as risk markers may help clinicians to assess their patients more fully and thus to prevent premature deaths in patients who have high risk
7661109 low serum cholesterol is commonly observed in individuals with ill health e g cancer patients and those with unhealthy lifestyle characteristics such as smoking and heavy drinking
7661110 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
7661111 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
7661112 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway
7661113 this work with antipsychotic drugs represents an entirely new approach for studying drug effects and developing new ones
7661114 using cells to monitor specific receptor signaling pathways could provide more selective medicines with fewer side effects
7661115 using these assays as a means to develop antipsychotics should be a useful way to target precise responses and improve patient symptoms
7661116 not all drugs used for schizophrenia have the same degree of movement related side effects
7661117 for some of the drugs these side effects may stem from interactions on the g protein part of the pathways
7661118 this finding highlights the limited impact of warnings and suggests that more effective approaches are needed to protect vulnerable populations from potentially hazardous medications
7661119 our studies in mice showed that we could selectively kill the defective autoimmune cells that were destroying insulin producing islets
7661120 these results show that the same selective destruction can occur in humans cells and connect what we saw in our animal studies with the protocol we are pursuing in our phase i clinical trial
7661121 it may be safe for women who have taken oral anticoagulants for 5 7 months after an unprovoked venous thromboembolism to discontinue therapy if they have 0 or 1 of the following 1 hyperpigmentation brown discoloration edema swelling or redness of either leg 2 a d dimer level blood clotting test of 250ug l or more while taking warfarin 3 bmi body mass index 30kg m2 and aged 65 years or more
7661122 it appears all men are at high risk of recurrence
7661123 ldl cholesterol levels below 2 80 mmol l and levels of at least 3 90 mmol l were both associated with markedly elevated risk of cancer among patients who did not use statins
7661124 the use of these levels as risk markers may help clinicians to assess their patients more fully and thus to prevent premature deaths in patients who have high risk
7661125 with the continuing decline of the ogallala aquifer water level and increasing cost of pumping water the use of drought tolerant and high yield corn hybrids is a key for sustainable corn production under limited irrigation
7661126 we hope to reduce the amount of water required for corn by at least 10 percent
7661127 the new multiple stress tolerant corn lines can be used to produce corn hybrids adapted to texas and other southern states
7661128 they can be a powerful tool to save water and produce crops with yield and grain quality under stressful environments
7661129 most of our breeding efforts start by crossing tropical corn with temperate elite lincontact dr wenwei xu wxu ag tamu edu 806 746 6101 texas a amp m university agricultural communicationssource eurekalertes
7661130 then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance agronomic productivity disease resistance insect resistance and value added grain characteristics
7661131 at 75 percent evapotranspiration you have 3 to 4 inches of available moisture that is used where if you are watering at 100 percent it is wasted
7661132 one of our experimental hybrids produced the same amount of silage in both locations when irrigation was reduced from 100 percent to 75 percent
7661133 developing and using new corn hybrids with improved tolerance to drought and other stresses is important and a viable water saving approach
7661134 our goal was to make our members aware of those risk factors
7661135 as long as you are aware and are doing something to correct it there wont be a fee we either do something to control claims costs or you pay the premium anyway
7661136 the successful measures by health plans focus on incentives rather than punishment
7661137 just addressing this through the health care system is insufficient what are we doing about the workplace environment whats served in state cafeterias and hospitals we need to do the voluntary things first for people to be able to make healthy choices before forcing punitive measures
7661138 all of you here in new york played such an instrumental role in my campaign working on my behalf the issues and the causes that we were fighting for and now i ask each and every one of you to work hard for barack and joe biden as you worked for me
7661139 and anyone who voted for me has so much more in common with senator obama than they will ever have with senator mccain and the republican party i have been consistent in delivering that message that is what i will be doing here
7661140 were worried about so many different things in this country and its time we focused on the middle class we can only do that we can only help the middle class if were unified and thats whats drawing everyone together
7661141 i think that the more folks get to know barack obama then the more they will support him

7661152 found that the 3 warnings about serious adverse events associated with use of atypical antipsychotic agents in elderly people with dementia had a limited effect on the prescription rates of these agents we also found that the overall rates of use of these drugs actually increased between the first warning in 2002 and the end of our follow up in 2007
7661153 this finding highlights the limited impact of warnings and suggests that more effective approaches are needed to protect vulnerable populations from potentially hazardous medications

7661165 while crude oil prices this week have been flat or trading slightly upwards on world markets the price of oil is still substantially below the all time high of 147 a barrel reached on july 17th and that decline is still being reflected at the gasoline pump that means consumers have seen prices drop by more than 10 percent in new mexico and nationally as well
7661166 in new mexico the three largest metropolitan areas are seeing gas prices fall steadily however in the more rural areas of the state prices remain noticeably higher than the national and statewide average its economics 101 and the rule of the marketplace because there are more gas stations in the cities they have to be more competitive drivers have more choices in rural areas where there are fewer stations theres less competition and owners can sell gas for a higher price even when prices fall

7661169 re i want to take a hip hop dance class dance refinery has a lowkey one on monday nights i took it there for a few years and it
7661170 the officers who arrested me were acting in a criminal manner as such id like to see the existing laws applied equally
7661171 the only fear i had was when these rogue cops did a felony action stop after i was let go knowing i had committed no crime knowing they knew i had committed no crime i couldnt understand why i now had weapons aimed at me
7661172 looking back i now realize it was an attempt to try and discourage me from openly carrying there again
7661173 what really stood out was the extremely rude manner in which the lead officer treated me
7661174 i cant believe you were walking around tanger mall with a loaded 357 do you reckon someone could teach them courtesy
7661175 i immediately told him he had no lawful authority to make such a statement
7661176 only the owner or authorized agent a very specific legal term could bar me from the premises
7661177 they looked at me and thought she doesnt fit the profile of someone coming in with a gun so they left me alone and i walked right past them
7661178 he yelled at me to get the belt off i told you to get the belt off so i took the belt off he ran his hands down over and pulled the pants down they went down around my ankle
7661179 she was yelling i have power i have power i have power
7661180 there is nothing thats off the table i have my positions and ill articulate them but nothings off the table
7661181 i dont want tax increases but that doesnt mean that anything is off the table
7661182 has a clear and demonstrated record of opposing tax increases john mccain is going to cut taxes
7661183 the fact that baracks people have not helped when he has this money machine behind him suggests that he hasnt pushed his people hard enough or his people havent pushed their donors or others hard enough and i think thats something that really grates on some of the clinton supporters

7661187 conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of christ
7661188 as long as we are regulated by the gospel we should value diversity as it reaches people beyond the limits of our own settings but this demands maturity the gospel calls us to put the interests of others ahead of our own but this demands mature discipleship can we tolerate different tastes and styles even when we do not like them can we vary our styles out of respect for what touches the heart of another even if it does not touch ours can we appreciate what a particular style does for one even though it is not as meaningful to us can we practice what is uncomfortable for us for the sake of the other the gospel demands that we do because jesus himself endured great discomfort to put it mildly for our sakes as disciples of jesus we must follow him into that kind of discomfort even suffering to say that we must suffer through a particular song for the sake of another trivializes the cross of christ but to deny that song to others simply on the basis of our own comfort and tradition is to reject the cross of christ for narcissism

7661459 theres a sense when you are doing it that it will go on forever but everyone knows that it wont so theres that weird sort of duality the whole time realizing that while it feels like this will go on forever it doesnt mean that that is necessarily going to be true
7661460 who knows what can happen next that really is the thing that excites me about this industry and this profession you never know who knows where we could be next year thats kind of a cool way to live your life ive got to say its kind of the way i dreamt it would be i think that its the double edged sword of being in this industry it can change with one phone call its like winning the lottery every time you go in for an audition youre basically buying a ticket and that ticket can take you anywhere and make you anything
7661461 theres something about having rda say im sorry that you wont be coming back next year that kind of makes it worthwhile
7661462 i dont know why but of everybody who said anything to me about it i felt like he knew more than anyone what it was like to have to walk away from a character like that

7661464 that would be ideal i would love to come up and do a couple of movies a year that would be perfect
7661465 theres always that need to go on and move on and theres always the hope that there will be other mckay like characters that people will identify with but i feel like for five years i did everything i possibly could to make that character come alive and im very very proud of the years weve had and im very very proud of the people ive worked with and the crews and everyone for everything they have put into this

7661546 ultimately these projects must result in the complete elimination of fossil fuel use as an energy source this must occur in the developed world more rapidly than the world as a whole the developing world is much less able to reduce its per capita energy use although aggressive measures should be taken to prevent the uncontrolled use of coal as an energy source

7661612 were going to do it in a constructive way but were going to lay it out very very clearly
7661613 get to see how god is so real and miraculous in the life of this little boy
7661614 have you ever stolen money from work and let someone else take the blame
7661615 have you ever applauded an act you found morally reprehensible
7661616 we are going to try to convince them that they need to get out and vote for this
7661617 i am very disappointed to see that republicans are not supporting our educational system
7661618 i know they feel like theyve paid enough but we are the second lowest taxed state in the country so when you get all of the people on the far right just like i cant stand the far left not wanting to do things its wrong and i hope they will straighten out
7661619 it poll results are not surprising considering everybody personal finance issues
7661620 it is going to be very hard for any ballot question not matter if its about education or public safety to pass
7661621 god forbid any type of tax increase that would unify republicans
7661622 clearly this is perhaps to most difficult time to be asking for an additional tax
7661623 but this is the time these school are not going to get any younger and their needs are not going to disappear over time in fact it is very shortsighted to think now is not the right time if we delay it makes it more expensive

7661629 if john mccain picks minnesota governor tim pawlenty as his running mate this week hell be allying himself with a key bush supporter and leaving no doubt that mccain means four more years of the same failed bush economic policies and same old politics
7661630 he mccain has an enormous disadvantage when it comes to the topics of changing washington or fixing our economy
7661631 they stayed at the hilton promenade at branson landing and had dinner at our cantina laredo

7661641 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill

7661644 never texted or emailed senator obama and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone
7661645 if youre at the altar and remember that a brother has something against you leave your offering there first go and be reconciled to him
7661646 why not rather be wronged why not rather be cheated than to act this way in front of unbelievers
7661647 you know what i will be able to dance i will make it i did cut my foot pretty badly in the hotel room last night
7661648 there was a mirror on a venetian little desk and it was all broken and i saw it and i almost cut my finger so to push away from it i used my foot because it just looked really bad so i did hurt myself but it was fine i went to the hospital im fine

7661650 david has been round at toms house a lot while katie and victoria have been swapping fashion tips on the phone david has been advising tom on diet
7661651 tom has a private gym at his home and david has been working out with him he also gave him diet advice tom has been sticking to 1 200 calories a day mostly grilled chicken and fish with lots of vegetables salads and fruit
7661652 david put together a work out regime that included the treadmill weight training and fencing lessons together
7661653 tom had been steadily gaining weight he didnt notice it at first but then he developed quite a paunch he hated it when pictures started appearing of him with a belly and love handles

7661659 it was blown way out of proportion by a sheriff who wanted his 15 minutes of fame my family is wonderful so very happy were all great
7661660 a deputy pulled his firearm fearing for his safety the situation was deflated as quickly as it began
7661661 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7661662 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7661663 hes an amazing guy and anybody would be lucky to be dating him
7661664 i definitely want to get something bad on the road it must be big enough for all my friends and to scare all the cars away from me im a good driver but its everyone else that im worried about
7661665 its handheld and digital tv businesses today the company has shed a little more light on what that entailed it turns out that broadcom
7661666 there is no turning back under any circumstances or influence now until every inch of land is recaptured and each and every terrorist is killed or captured
7661667 both sides to this long conflict have again shown that they will jeopardize the lives of thousands of ordinary people in the pursuit of military objectives
7661668 in the absence of independent international monitors sri lankan civilians lack protection and remain at the mercy of two forces with long records of abuse
7661669 they are very crafty and have given up territory in the past to draw the army in and then back strike hard
7661670 the only thing that can bring about a conclusion to the bloodshed is a political solution that cuts the ground from under their feet
7661671 i was often accused of being unsociable though i fear the charge was applied in a very loose sense in substance it boiled down to my dislike of artificiality and publicity
7661672 the australian notion of the type of upper class englishman who looked condescendingly upon colonials
7661673 as that of a nation waiting for the declaration of war
7661674 we want to see a middle east that is of strategic importance not for its conflicts
7661675 the healing process is going to be a little longer than four days
7661676 i find him inexperienced i find him insincere we have an unqualified candidate who has little more than empty rhetoric and a lot of money at his disposal
7661677 what is with the commenters here maybe theyd be happier reading valleywag since they clearly care more about bashing than about credible info
7661678 on the first day we just went out for dinner and didnt play any music at all
7661679 i had already prepared the compositions and on the second day we actually recorded about five hours of music straight without a break this session became farscape i i have never experienced such an exciting thing in my entire career as an artist the next day was just as intense and this session became farscape ii another majestic gripping experience with an exceptional artist
7661680 it was back in 1924 and lyndon and i were selected as being a debating team to represent the johnson city high school in the blanco county portion of the state of texas interscholastic debate literary events
7661681 we won all three decisions of the judges and we advanced to the district in san marcos where we got third place being beat out by a debating team from the high school in kyle texas
7661682 were all nice people now just like in the country neighbors if theyre really good neighbors you say their chickens roost together well our chickens and lyndons chickens didnt roost together but we were still good neighbors and good friends
7661683 i saw him once as senator i happened to be in washington and i went up to the capitol building and saw lyndon the congress was in session and of course he was subject to being on the senate floor so our interview was very brief
7661684 now lyndons father sam ealy was a member of the texas legislature and he was for the poor man the farmer and the rancher and he served several sessions
7661685 he saw my father and asked if my father would support him and did my father think he had any chance
7661686 and my father told him yes you have a chance and yes ill vote for you and he did every time he ran for public office
7661687 he was my steady from the very beginning which my mother was against because she thought i should be meeting other men
7661688 but i said no mother this is the young man i want to date
7661689 he looked over at me and im waving my scarf and he salutes me
7661690 and donna jewel turned and said were never going to see them again and i said yes we are well guess what
7661691 the doorbell rings and i open the door and theres the base commander
7661692 i had hopes that somewhere theyd find him but they didnt and then they found the remains
7661693 and they said real quietly they paused for a few moments and they said could we have about 12 of the envelopes mrs scharf well return them to you and i said sure and thats how it happened
7661694 as we were landing the flight attendant said to the passengers ladies and gentlemen last night we picked up a very special passenger from hawaii
7661695 i said to them i want to thank you for your wonderful love at this moment for my husband and me thank you all ever so much i was getting very emotional i still do when i say that
7661696 i can go anytime i want to talk to him and i love sitting out there and i know where hes at
7661697 hes not in the mud not lost forever in the jungle
7661698 we didnt have television in those days when the word came through we were whooping it up and being so happy and relieved you never knew what was going to happen until then
7661699 we knew they were going to get into manila because they were already in the philippine islands so we knew the next stop would be manila and we were on that boat out of there
7661700 we got hold of some liquor and drank it and i will say this it was the only time in my life ive ever been drunk
7661701 it was moonlight and we drove into a spot with german military vehicles on both sides of the road
7661702 we just had to keep moving and i wondered when they were going to start shooting at us but they didnt we never saw a sign of a german we got through all right but if everyones heart was where mine was it was right in their teeth
7661703 but the racket we made should have woken them up and they should have had guards out anyway
7661704 they must have thought we were bait that if they showed up theyd be shot at but it sure scared us
7661705 oh there was dancing in the street and everyone was hollering and we were very happy
7661706 some of the boys said they were the best dressed men in the army
7661707 we went to the hospitals we helped feed people we went all over wherever they needed us we went during the blackouts and everything
7661708 i didnt raise my boy to be a soldier i brought him up to be my pride and joy i wouldnt put a musket on his shoulder hell kill another mothers boy
7661709 a blur of excitement laughter and tears back thumping and leg of lamb on mint jelly neighbors and martinis and a bottle of champagne that had been hopefully put on ice days before
7661710 am i going to get a chance to fight in a war daddy
7661711 turn on the radio ada something big is going to happen all the teletype machines have gone quiet
7661712 if the u s is not buying digital tvs they will stop making them
7661713 so the emerging markets will have to move to digital by default
7661714 the sale of our dtv business is a key step in amds transformation helping to strengthen our balance sheet lower our break even point and hone our focus in order to take full advantage of our position as a leader in both microprocessors and graphics technology

7661747 but our hopes of winning a gold medal in football were once again frustrated
7661748 we have to start taking sports more seriously in brazil
7661749 we have to encourage city and state governments as well as businessmen to start contributing more so that our teams and athletes can become more competitive and thus help brazil perform better
7661750 if we start doing this now we will be able to improve a lot for 2012 the london olympics and be a leading force in 2016
7661751 you see you spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time
7661752 nothing in this section affects the powers of the governor general including the power to dissolve parliament at the governor generals discretion
7661753 what that means is that the governor general can dissolve parliament whenever the governor general wishes
7661754 the convention is that the governor general only dissolves parliament at the request of the prime minister
7661755 fixed election dates stop leaders from trying to manipulate the calendar simply for partisan political advantage
7661756 unless were defeated or prevented from governing we want to keep moving forward to make this minority parliament work over the next three years
7661757 there are many people in canada who would claim that become is the wrong verb there
7661758 since hes committed himself to the four year fixed term and fixed election date it requires some face saving arrangement which he can argue is plausible for calling an election sooner
7661759 he has to find some face saving grounds before he didnt have to he could just say i dont like the way the house is behaving
7661760 were way past that date in ottawa now way past it
7661761 what hes doing is breaking a commitment he made to the house of commons this isnt the first time this government or any government for that matter has broken what they said
7661762 its fairly unprecedented that the supreme court would release someone to begin with and then secondly that they would stay all proceedings against that person as theyre out in the community
7661763 the supreme court usually doesnt take this active a role in these cases
7661764 if i was the state of ohio i do think i would be interpreting this as the case is trending toward the supreme court looking favorably on our arguments
7661765 these are favorable rulings hes encouraged by that we like the way its going hes out with his family again
7661766 results of genetic testing from three samples of the products recalled by maple leaf foods show that two tested positive for the outbreak strain of listeria
7661767 test results for the third product were a close match to the outbreak strain but showed a slight variance while these results are highly significant and indicate that the investigation is on the right path the investigation is not complete test results on additional food samples expected next week will advance the investigation further
7661768 maple leaf products have not been directly linked to consumer illness and death
7661769 the cfia press releases identify that the strain of listeria that has been linked to illness and loss of life matches the listeria strain found in two maple leaf products
7661770 so from that perspective it would be premature to speculate on any financial liability what i can say is that in common with other food companies maple leaf does have and does purchase food liability insurance
7661771 its clear that confidence in maple leaf and our brand has been shaken
7661772 i feel very badly about that and i regret very deeply that i cant say what the long term implications will be all i can say is how well behave in the near term if we fundamentally do the right thing and act in the interest of public health we can rebuild that confidence
7661773 they are doing the right thing instead of trying to protect their butts if you think that is the right strategy then buying the shares at 9 60 makes a lot of sense
7661774 its a heck of a lot cheaper than my costs and i bought those shares to make money i havent seen anything that changes the basic reason why i bought the stock
7661775 coming into a new situation i wanted to be the leader that i can be
7661776 thats all i can do thats what im focusing on doing
7661777 we worked hard against one another and tried to make each other better were both competitors we both want to get out there and win and help our team win
7661778 thats been my whole thought process through the bye week of doing what i can do to be better
7661779 my job is to go out there and perform and do my job to the fullest and the highest level possible
7661780 no one puts any more pressure on me than myself
7661781 the drama of romance and sensuality to the drama of edification
7661782 with every mans hand against me i am here in despair and why for doing what brutus was honored for
7661783 the kind of mob that gives you a hitler or a mussolini
7661784 he definitely had listeria we just dont know if its the same type of listeria that could be potentially linked to these deli meats
7661785 definitely in the time frame when this outbreak has occurred and thats why theyre a probable case
7661786 a empresa xyz est em busca de um jornalista para trabalhar como assessor de imprensa de contas variadas precisa ter pelo menos 1 ano de experi ncia nessa rea de publicidade e propaganda se j for formado melhor ainda
7661787 unity is a great school we have a great staff here
7661788 i want you to all be active itll be good to get to know each other
7661789 we just wanted to welcome some of the new parents who this might be the first time having a child come to school i just wanted them to be at ease with sending their children letting them know theyll be safe here
7661790 it also gives them some tips to be successful parents to make sure their children are successful
7661791 its not as tough as i thought it was going to be
7661792 i get to see her first steps into the schooling world this is the beginning of her school career
7661793 its awesome the schools have a program like this its awesome how school has evolved you get to meet the teachers and the principals which is a very good thing
7661794 the parents need to understand they need to be active in their childrens education
7661795 the children just need to know that they need to do their best active parenting is the key without active parents the children really struggle
7661796 it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for the indian courts decision
7661797 mattels action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary
7661798 listening to us congratulate ourselves on providing great music to the masses
7661799 archbishop burkes great love and zeal for our lord in the blessed sacrament compels him to send a clear message dont desecrate the holy eucharist by presenting yourself for communion while persisting in your support of child murder
7661800 we are excited to see archbishop burke continuing to battle for the lives of innocent preborn children
7661801 support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives
7661802 should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
7661803 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather with the concern of the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
7661804 we thank archbishop burke for his clear teaching in regard to
7661805 the road map to peace only moves in one direction and that direction is from the west bank to the mediterranean sea the only thing in the way is israel

7661808 we know from previous research that the uninsured have poor outcomes on a number of measures and they are less likely to seek care when they need it
7661809 but we know less about what actually happens when the uninsured try to obtain health care in various settings and more specifically how institutions deal with these patients
7661810 we found that the public institution was the most open to seeing patients in a variety of settings by contrast the for profit institution would really only see patients in the emergency department
7661811 the for profit basically took its losses and seemed to say well just see these folks in the emergency department we wont work too hard to get money from them and so be it
7661812 and not surprisingly the not for profit fell in between
7661813 as we move forward in the political process we have to recognize that this is essentially an unmanaged group a group of people who dont know what theyre going to get they are getting care from a set of institutions that are uncomfortable and unsure about what it is they want to provide
7661814 one of the largest actions at a convention in history
7661815 the country is celebrating one hundred years of freedom one hundred years too soon
7661816 in the middle of a whirlwind 2008 convention protests movement and movements
7661817 none of the parties have adequately addressed the political prisoners issue
7661818 im here to help push home the point that the united states has political prisoners explicity political prisoners and has a lot of them
7661819 the democrats obama biden are vying for ascendancy to have control over a system that creates prison conditions that are endemic systematically have you ever heard of someone campaigning for the release of political prisoners i havent
7661820 it doesnt matter if its a republican or a democrat obama is a new face on the same brutal and bloody empire
7661821 i cant wait to hear hillary clinton talk about the future and am excited that her candidacy is unifying our party
7661822 im just a stuffed dog what do i want with goggles and a swimcap

7661837 the bitch of living the musicals creators pay tribute to the spirit of the original
7661838 wedekind was about adolescent angst the way adolescents now deal with their angst is they listen to indie rock and emo so what better way of channeling the angst of 1891 german kids than to send them into this kind of alternate reality where they become rock stars in their bedrooms
7661839 we were trying to make sure that what we did had integrity
7661840 and was progressive and was true to the spirit of frank wedekind but was yes trying to bring a new audience to the theater
7661841 i love the fact that the brackets of musical theater are being expanded
7661842 and should more accurately be called hormonal awakening i am of the older generation its not for me
7661843 the experience of becoming an adult and moving out of childhood transcends time and place
7661844 this is when you start to define yourself and the world starts to define you the changes you are experiencing physically emotionally socially and in every other way are so extreme that inevitably things are triggered you start to become the person you are

7661854 our conditions were uncomfortable but because were westerners we suffered absolutely nothing compared to what the tibetan people suffer
7661855 the protesters participated in tibet independence activities and that is against chinas law
7661856 the relevant countries will teach their citizens to abide and respect chinas laws
7661857 they asked about our actions our roles about our lives everything from where i went to high school to everything i ate in china

7661863 hes a person who has no judgment no experience and
7661864 if russia decides to step back from those accession commitments that it has already made it will further delay its aspirations for joining the wto
7661865 by its recent actions russia is putting its aspirations at risk
7661866 russia intends to inform various wto partners of its withdrawal from accords that contradict its interests
7661867 it turns out that we dont see or feel any pluses from membership and if there are some we still carry a burden
7661868 we need to get things clear with our partners we need to think most seriously about protecting our manufacturers
7661869 youre a selfish son of a bitch shamus one of these days youre gonna take one wrong step too many and find out youve walked into a minefield

7661876 the president is puzzled and he doesnt recognize this as the scott mcclellan that he hired and confided in and worked with for so many years
7661877 the president was disappointed that if he had these concerns and these thoughts he never came to him or anyone else on the staff
7661878 strictly faithful to the constitution who would not engage in
7661879 the current demand for our forces in iraq and afghanistan exceeds the sustainable supply and limits our ability to provide ready forces for other contingencies overall our readiness is being consumed as fast as we build it if unaddressed this lack of balance poses a significant risk to the all volunteer force and degrades the armys ability to make a timely response to other contingencies
7661880 i was living a caricature of a black male adolescence
7661881 i really wanted to stay up there to hear my voice bouncing off the crowd and returning back to me in applause

7661885 i dont mope around at night worrying that i didnt look good on jay leno though i saw myself and though ive lost 30 pounds ive got to lose more
7661886 i will never go negative i will never attack them personally i will however emphasize my advantage over senators clinton and obama the so called front running candidates arrive do a structured town meeting with a thousand people in a gym and then leave i go into living rooms and meet people directly i stay for three days go into 10 homes a day each with 100 people i connect with people my message is getting out my ads are well received hell there was some political writer who predicted ill win iowa did you see that you never know
7661887 you target your efforts and resources in the two most important states in the race iowa and new hampshire people there arent swayed by the smarty pants set in washington and new york
7661888 i want all troops out of iraq residual troops too the other leading candidates dont they leave in 25 000 or 50 000
7661889 too many people in washington have been listening to the wrong military and political advisors thats why were in this mess i would shift our priorities our obsession with iraq has cost us the ability to form international coalitions and strategies to deal with international terrorism nuclear weapons and the like it may be the greatest cost of the war
7661890 when we invaded i said i supported the invasion in order to support the troops at the time i felt it was the best thing as i look back it was a mistake at the time however i was making public statements and wasnt participating in the decision to invade the president should have gone to the un and used diplomacy but i didnt push hard enough i should have pushed harder for diplomacy but remember we were also operating on limited information at the time i thought i dont have all the intelligence bush says saddam has weapons of mass destruction however i never bought the al qaeda link so it was a mistake and what happened afterward was massive incompetence and massive deception
7661891 the first week im president i would take on three issues and we would have to come up with solutions bipartisan solutions one is iraq weve got to get out the second is our 9 trillion deficit third is social security and medicare
7661892 i am strongly pro choice ive always been pro choice to the consternation of my bishops in new mexico as president i would have a national goal to reduce abortions and id promote strong adoption procedures i would encourage family planning but i wouldnt apologize for my position on choice
7661893 ill first tell you what i did as governor i proposed doubling the number of border patrol agents which is consistent with a 9 11 commission recommendation i can easily see 15 000 at the border right now it isnt adequately protected i would extend the tour of the national guard many of us had reservations about using the guard for this but it seems to be working theyre deterring the flow i would also increase the detection equipment at the border my worst nightmare is nuclear material uranium plutonium being transported by a terrorist across the border and two years ago i angered a lot of hispanic and immigrant groups by being the first governor to declare a border emergency at the time the border patrol was almost nonexistent in my quarter there were drugs coming in violence the flow was huge i declared a border emergency which enabled me as governor to hire local law enforcement i took state appropriations to pay for law enforcement at the border which is essentially a federal function also i vetoed legislation that said local law enforcement couldnt cooperate with federal law enforcement agencies
7661894 fidel castro has an enormously powerful intellect and is well informed he told me he reads every newspaper sees every morning broadcast and reads prodigiously he showed me all the books he read while i have enormous dislike for his policies especially human rights he incarcerates everybody who disagrees with him he is a fascinating character who tries to intimidate you with his intellect saddam hussein on the other hand tried to intimidate me with his physical actions he would try to stare me down he had a bunch of the revolutionary guard around us he was heavily armed his gestures were menacing but through his intellect castro would try to destroy every argument i made about why he should take certain steps
7661895 i dont try to imitate him this has always been my style but yes theres a little bit of bill clinton in me one of the things that used to drive me nuts about him though was how he would try to convince his enemies he was a good guy hed sometimes spend more time talking to his enemies than to his friends i dont believe im like that but i do believe you try to seek common ground in order to convince somebody
7661896 i resent some elites telling me my position on gun control is wrong for example its a cultural issue in new mexico and the west a respect for a way of life most gun owners are law abiding im not going to change my position thats where i may deviate from others in my party too the elites on the coasts i have very common tastes
7661897 i like sports im a regular person i dont make any pretenses i like the arts i like modern art but id rather spend time watching a football game or a baseball game i go to the opera and leave at intermission i like to smoke a cigar
7661898 i think there is a handful of people who hate america unfortunately for them a lot of them are losing their homes in a forest fire today
7661899 there are a few people that hate america but i dont think the democrats are those i think there are those posing as democrats that are like that
7661900 i guess they mean i havent been in washington long enough
7661901 then they can change a city if they can change a city they can change a state and if they can change a state they can change the country
7661902 and if they can change the country they can change the world
7661903 one thing to consider about how the olbermanns and oreillys garner so much attention with such little reach
7661904 is that their audience is largely made up of influentials these people control information and when they pass it off to their friends olbermanns and oreillys messages go beyond the 1 million to 2 million people who watch the show
7661905 the thrill of prediction markets for political junkies is that they harness the wisdom of crowds
7661906 lots of people wager on the outcome of political campaigns whos going to be the democratic presidential nominee will the republicans take back the house and when the votes are counted the winning bettors collect
7661907 almost all municipal water in america is so good that nobody needs to import a single bottle from italy or france or the fiji islands
7661908 tap water may now be the equal of bottled water but that could change the more the wealthy opt out of drinking tap water the less political support there will be for investing in maintaining americas public water supply that would be a serious loss access to cheap clean water is basic to the nations health the real change though will come when millions of ordinary consumers realize that they can save money and save the planet by turning in their water bottles and turning on the tap
7661909 president bushs top counterterrorism advisers acknowledged today that the strategy for fighting osama bin ladens al qaeda leadership in pakistan had failed as the white house released a grim new intelligence assessment that

7661912 you should be able to buy that at a liquor store
7661913 and some of the broadest principles undergirding them have survived intact but out of public view
7661914 the president has challenged a federal ban on torture a request for data on the administration of the usa patriot act and numerous other assertions of congressional power as recently as december bush asserted the authority to open u s mail without judicial warrants in a signing statement attached to a postal reform bill
7661915 of those 19 provisions six nearly a third were not carried out according to law ten were executed by the executive branch on three others conditions did not require an executive branch response
7661916 the fccs position is not irrational it is not arbitrary and capricious
7661917 hollywood will be able to say anything they want whenever they want
7661918 the chinese model of an internet that allows economic growth but not free speech or privacy is growing in popularity from a handful of countries five years ago to dozens of governments today who block sites and arrest bloggers
7661919 you know i dont really think that im that good at politics to tell you the truth
7661920 what politics has become requires a level for tolerance for trivia and artifice and nonsense that i find i have in short supply
7661921 in our view the court does not comprehend or is indifferent to the insidious way in which women can be victims of pay discrimination
7661922 have you ever read about the reason they attacked us they attacked us because weve been over there weve been bombing iraq for 10 years im suggesting that we listen to the people who attacked us
7661923 that was an extraordinary statement as someone who has lived through the attacks of september 11th that we invited the attack because we were attacking iraq
7661924 i dont think ive ever heard that before and ive heard some pretty absurd explanations for september 11th
7661925 the abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because god will not be mocked
7661926 aids is the wrath of a just god against homosexuals
7661927 i believe that all of us are born heterosexual physically created with a plumbing thats heterosexual and created with the instincts and desires that are basically fundamentally heterosexual but i believe that we have the ability to experiment in every direction experimentation can lead to habitual practice and then to a lifestyle but i dont believe anyone begins a homosexual
7661928 i must personally say that i do question the sincerity and nonviolent intentions of some civil rights leaders such as dr martin luther king jr mr james farmer and others who are known to have left wing associations
7661929 you know i supported martin luther king jr who did practice civil disobedience
7661930 i hope i live to see the day when as in the early days of our country we wont have any public schools the churches will have taken them over again and christians will be running them
7661931 i listen to feminists and all these radical gals these women just need a man in the house thats all they need most of the feminists need a man to tell them what time of day it is and to lead them home and they blew it and theyre mad at all men feminists hate men theyre sexist they hate men thats their problem

7661934 the mostly quiet and unspectacular invasion of illegal immigrants does not focus the attention of the nations the way open warfare does but is all the more insidious for its stealth and innocuousness
7661935 former pastor and southern baptist leader lonnie latham who had for years prominently preached against homosexuality was arrested outside a hotel in oklahoma city in 2006 and charged with soliciting a lewd encounter with a man but rather than tearfully apologize and enter rehab latham demanded a trial to proclaim his constitutional right to engage in consensual sex with an adult male and in march 2007 he was acquitted
7661936 its time the self appointed strategists on capitol hill understood a very simple concept you cannot win a war if you tell the enemy when youre going to quit
7661937 is there anything that might prevent you from doing your job
7661938 the next thing i remember i fainted and i was on the floor
7661939 the ugliest part was my dear friend from las vegas a male friend was giving me mouth to mouth resuscitation we had about six beautiful girls there and there was my friend doing his part

7661944 you know all the surveys say that evangelicals have the best sex life of any other group
7661945 franken has no government experience franken was raised in minnesota but he spent most of his adulthood outside the state
7661946 i couldnt rule it out because its not something i ever thought about in a serious capacity
7661947 its like being named the tallest midget in the midget colony
7661948 by gonzales logic the constitution doesnt offer an express grant of freedom of speech freedom of religion the right to bear arms or the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures it simply says that the government shall not take those rights away

7661954 the political game as played by some writers is a combination of gossip innuendo sly character assassination and outright lies hackneyed criticism and accusations palpably based on misinformation and deliberate distortion
7661955 i am quite ready to admit the right and duty of congress to watch the executive department and to make such investigations as they may choose in order that their law making function may be properly performed

7661958 you know education if you make the most of it you study hard you do your homework and you make the effort to be smart you can do quite well if you dont you get stuck in iraq
7661959 you know education if you study history if you look at the long troubled history of iraq if you dont treat intelligence as a plaything that can be manipulated if you respect the proven effective powell doctrine and dont go into a country without overwhelming force if you dont ignore the advice of your most respected military leaders and instead go in with half the troops they recommended if you dont delegate all decisions to stiff necked ideologues and actually seek out discordant views if you dont appoint inexperienced synchophants who disband the iraqi military if you ignore the copious feedback that tells you your plan is just not working if you refuse to act like a cheerleader and instead act like a world leader you can do quite well
7661960 the first of the seven famous debates between abraham lincoln and stephen a douglas took place on august 21 1858 in ottowa illinois their arrangement provided that douglas would speak first for one hour lincoln would take an hour and a half to reply douglas a half hour to rebut lincolns reply this debate was considerably shorter than those to which the two men were accustomed in fact they had tangled several times before and all of their encounters had been much lengthier and more exhausting for example on october 16 1854 in peoria illinois douglas delivered a thee hour address to which lincoln by agreement was to respond when lincolns turn came he reminded the audience that it was already 5 p m that he would probably require as much time as douglas and douglas was still scheduled for a rebuttal he proposed therefore that the audience go home have dinner and return refreshed for four more hours of talk the audience amiably agreed and matters proceeded as lincoln had outlined what kind of audience was this who were these people who could so cheerfully accommodate themselves to seven hours or oratory it should be noted by the way that lincoln and douglas were not presidential candidates at the time of their encounter in peoria they were not even candidates for the united states senate but their audiences were no especially concerned with their official status these were people who regarded such events as essential to their political education who took them to be an integral part of their social lives and who were quite accustomed to extend oratorical performances typically at county or state fairs programs included many speakers most of whom were allotted three hours for the arguments and since it was preferred that speakers not go unanswered their opponents were allotted an equal length of time is there any audience of americans today who could endure seven hours of talk
7661961 most virginians and americans would find passages such as those below shocking especially coming from the pen of someone who seeks the privilege of serving in the united states senate one of the highest offices in the land from webbs 2002 novel lost soldiers a shirtless man walked toward them along a mud pathway
7661962 i met harold at the playboy party harold call me

7661965 what kind of a man parties with playboy playmates in lingerie then films political ads from a church pew
7661966 some say the group has secretly already made up its mind about recommending a dramatically new direction in iraq after the election

7661977 since a number of years the upc is in one part at the centre of permanent controversy and in the other victim of all sorts of infighting and abuse of diverse origins despite this the secretary general has always opted for silence for the simple reason that it must wade off attacks by detractors and other adversaries my party and i are going to exhaust national or international legal means to instil justice and stability in the upc
7661978 all her efforts have been frustrated by kungo who has refused to transfer the fcfa 80 000 to the authorities responsible for the processing of application for residence permits

7661983 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7661984 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7661985 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7661986 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7661987 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7661988 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7661989 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7661990 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7661991 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

7661994 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7661995 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7661996 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7661997 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7661998 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7661999 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7662000 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7662001 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends

7662008 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7662009 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7662010 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7662011 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7662012 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7662013 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7662014 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

7662017 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7662018 save me from repetition he feels clever tonight it is going to hurt to compliment him
7662019 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7662020 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7662021 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7662022 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7662023 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7662024 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7662025 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7662026 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7662027 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7662028 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7662029 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7662030 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7662031 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7662032 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7662033 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7662034 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7662035 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7662036 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7662037 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7662038 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7662039 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7662040 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7662041 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7662042 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7662043 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7662044 the own goal that led to his murder when colombia were eliminated from the world cup
7662045 very straightforward graph that cuts to the heart of the candidates tax philosophies
7662046 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7662047 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7662048 during a pacific storm on january 10 1992 three 40 foot containers holding 30 000 friendly floatees plastic bath toys from a chinese factory were washed off a ship two thirds of the ducks floated south and landed three months later on the shores of indonesia australia and south america the remaining 10 000 ducks headed north to alaska and then completed a full circle back near japan caught up in the north pacific gyre current as the so called great pacific garbage patch many of the ducks then entered the bering strait between alaska and russia and were trapped in the arctic ice they moved through the ice at a rate of one mile per day and in 2000 they were sighted in the north atlantic the movement of the ducks had been monitored by american oceanographer curtis ebbesmeyer
7662049 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7662050 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7662051 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7662052 the elephants joints were almost as mobile as trotting horses
7662053 best of all when researcher john hutchinson compared athletic thai elephants with their more sluggish uk zoo cousins their movements were essentially the same captivity had not modified the elephants mobility range just slowed them down a little the uk zoos keepers were very pleased says hutchinson
7662054 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7662055 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7662056 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7662057 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7662058 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7662059 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7662060 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7662061 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7662062 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self control against such things there is no law
7662063 he who began a good work in you will be faithful to complete it

7662067 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7662068 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7662069 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7662070 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7662071 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7662072 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7662073 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7662074 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7662075 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7662076 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7662077 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7662078 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7662079 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7662080 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7662081 there are periods of time when we have up to 10 and 12 patients waiting in emergency to get access to an in patient bed but there is somebody in the in patient bed
7662082 the emergency department should be there to provide emergency care not to have patients who are waiting to be admitted
7662083 why isnt eastern health dealing with the shortage of acute beds instead of using people as pawns that they are moving around to deal with this acute shortage
7662084 average daily consumption among males was 17 cigarettes per day while female daily smokers averaged 13 7 in 2007
7662085 let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion
7662086 the government will introduce legislation that will punish criminals who commit violence against pregnant women but do so in a way that leaves no room for the introduction of fetal rights
7662087 weve heard the criticism from across the country including representatives from the medical community that mr epps bill could be interpreted as instilling fetal right
7662088 this bill will be very clear and straightforward and the bill will not be misinterpreted
7662089 cerin ele exprese ale celor de la ghimpe sunt 1
7662090 our data do support the premise that risk factor profiles vary by breast cancer subtype and that hormonal risk factors have a greater impact on luminal type breast cancers than her 2 overexpressing or triple negative tumors

7662092 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7662093 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7662094 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7662095 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7662096 we at coca cola are not saying that we cause miracles what is very coca cola and real about it is that we dont claim to transform lives but simply envelop one moment with joy and on hindsight isnt life an ensemble of small moments that we cherish and hold dear
7662097 los grupos m s conservadores y grupos de poder ansiosos de recuperar el poder perdido
7662098 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7662099 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know

7662113 no tengo nada que decir sobre la cantidad de medallas nos preocupamos con la evoluci n cualitativa
7662114 creo que la participaci n fue razonable como brasile o uno espera que se ganen todas las medallas de oro posibles
7662115 la frustraci n que siempre tenemos es que esperamos que el f tbol tenga medalla de oro
7662116 brasil gan en algunas cosas que no ten a costumbre de ganar como mauren maggi que gan en salto y fue extremadamente importante las chicas de voleibol que ten an que ganar en atenas ganaron oro ahora y c sar cielo medalla de oro y bronce demostr que brasil puede prepararse mejor para nataci n

7662127 ok so im the office leader now what do i do
7662128 its a call for the church to forego worldly power direct power and do christs work as an alternative vision of the world indirect power
7662129 it is based on the hebrew scripture story of moses birth and the role of three women in saving him and in doing so saving gods people
7662130 you know israelite women they are not human they are like animals having children even before we can turn around and kill the infant boys there is no way to stop them
7662131 it becomes clear that choices made by women in the course of their domestic lives determine the destiny of the entire people
7662132 the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor
7662133 the lord does say that but it is our duty as the church to feed the hungry clothe the threadbare and connect those eagerly seeking work with social services that can help
7662134 i know what you mean i am jewish and all of the saturday games conflict with our childrens participation in hebrew school
7662135 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7662136 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7662137 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7662138 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7662139 todo tiene su tiempo y todo lo que se quiere

7662141 for that which ye do send out shall return unto you again
7662142 the agenda was secret until maurice blew it the prospect of having the 50 extra tax cut they promised the average worker snatched away by the weekly road toll bill of course makes it clear that their policies are all about taking with one hand and giving with the other but you dont end up any better off at all and arguably worse
7662143 and of course prisons are very much in that frame as well now new zealand doesnt have a particularly happy experience with private money being brought in to build public facility in the health system
7662144 which would at the end of the lease have seen the board pay 20 million in rent i understand with still no ownership at all
7662145 we really have been down these roads before with the national party on the partial privatization of core social infrastructure
7662146 one of the issues in new zealand has always been in getting projects of sufficient scale to make that the ppp model of interest but its an area where you have to tread fairly carefully because the examples are legendary of where these kinds of projects have backfired in governments faces
7662147 its going to be tough but whoever they put in there theyre going to manage
7662148 theyll be all right theyre playing around three pro bowlers so theyll be all right
7662149 people think im old im not that old yet so hopefully those healing cells are still in there

7662157 i felt like this was a great option for me to come back and start
7662158 it didnt happen but the seasons just around the corner im not anticipating anything happening but ive got to be ready because that moment could be the biggest moment of my career ive got to take off and be ready to go
7662159 its something i have to deal with right now but im going to make sure i do whatever i need to do to make sure im a great player in this league
7662160 my personal goals havent changed my role in the immediate future has changed but my outlook hasnt changed at all

7662458 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7662459 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7662460 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7662461 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter

7662517 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7662518 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7662519 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7662520 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7662521 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7662522 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7662523 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7662524 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7662525 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7662526 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7662527 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7662528 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7662529 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar

7662562 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7662563 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7662564 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7662565 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7662566 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7662567 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

7662571 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7662572 my friend mark said that he saw a ninja totally uppercut some kid just because the kid opened a window
7662573 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7662574 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7662575 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7662576 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7662577 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7662578 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7662579 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7662580 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7662581 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7662582 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7662583 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7662584 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7662585 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7662586 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

7662590 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7662591 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7662592 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7662593 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7662594 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7662595 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7662596 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7662597 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7662598 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7662599 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7662600 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7662601 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7662602 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7662603 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7662604 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7662605 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7662606 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7662607 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7662608 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7662609 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7662610 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7662611 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7662612 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7662613 who are open to doing something on the production side
7662614 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7662615 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7662616 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

7662619 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
7662620 i think theyre two separate problems that came together at the same time
7662621 there were local issues going back to the late 1990s in nassau county with its budget problems and suffolk has had a disunited republican party even just taking the congressional seats on long island we didnt lose any of them due to national issues
7662622 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7662623 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7662624 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7662625 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7662626 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7662627 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7662628 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7662629 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7662630 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7662631 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7662632 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7662633 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes

7662642 lo estamos dejando muy claro igual o de mayor importancia es el partido del jueves por lo que nos jugamos porque estando tan cerca de la fase de grupos de la uefa no queremos dejarlo escapar despu s de lo que sufrimos y de la remontada que hicimos el a o pasado nadie imaginaba que bamos a llegar a este punto
7662643 todos los que venimos de otro equipo de otro pa s al f tbol europeo so amos con jugar un d a la uefa la liga de campeones y poco a poco vamos cumpliendo objetivos en mi segundo a o aqu estoy a un pasito de jugar en europa y todos sabemos la importancia de este tipo de torneos te dan madurez y te proyectan
7662644 escuchaba que hab a mucho pesimismo por el 0 0 pero nosotros lo vemos de una manera muy diferente sabemos que el gol visitante cuenta mucho y nosotros no jugamos mal de visitante por lo general fuera de casa hacemos gol y eso nos da la ilusi n de que podemos avanzar
7662645 ellos van a estar m s presionados ahora que juegan en casa y nosotros no tenemos nada que perder ojal pueda darse un partido bueno para nosotros con m s espacios habr que aprovecharlos
7662646 no es nada nuevo ni sorprendente que un equipo como el real madrid haya sacado adelante un partido como el de la supercopa porque tiene grandes figuras somos conscientes del equipo al que nos vamos a enfrentar pero lo haremos sin ning n tipo de miedo o de temor

7662656 there is absolutely no reason for anyone other than police officers or security officials to have guns allowing the average citizen to carry a weapon into a school only increases the potential for tragedy miscommunication could lead to disaster a teacher may interpret a students body language to be threatening or vice versa and then chaos ensues
7662657 we also have to bear in mind the overall picture of the other games on next sunday and ensure the maximum publicity for our association we felt that in bringing patrons back they were getting exceptional value for money on a three game programme
7662658 it was just a formal announcement today the decision to quit the coalition was in fact taken on saturday when ppp co chairman asif ali zardari decided to run in the presidential election without consulting the coalition partners
7662659 we have decided to sit in the opposition benches in parliament because ppp leader zardari had reneged on a series of solemn commitments including a written agreement signed by both parties on august 7 that deposed judges would be restored within 24 hours of impeachment or resignation of pervez musharraf from the presidency
7662660 we showed extreme patience and were forced into withdrawing from the coalition because of the broken promises of the ppp leadership

7662665 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7662666 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7662667 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7662668 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7662669 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record

7662671 every time i would do a new series i would always get these letters from people saying my boyfriend wants to be a crab fisherman and he thinks he can do that job or my girlfriend can be a truck driver
7662672 i realized i would get more and more of these letters so i thought it would be really cool to give ordinary men and women from all walks the life from all parts of the country the opportunity to actually go in as a first time employee a first day a greenhorn and try these jobs

7662730 if the only reason you wanted to know how much money i make is just so you can borrow some to buy a silly toy or some other nonsense then you march yourself straight to your room and go to bed think about why youre being so selfish i work long hard hours everyday and dont have time for such childish games

7662757 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7662758 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7662759 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7662760 but i am a frustrated democrat and have been for a long time because we have until recently said little about why we should govern
7662761 as long as we have tried to blur that difference as a political strategy i believe it has hurt us
7662762 and i believe it has been a particular problem right now
7662763 i believe what people are looking for is visionary positive leadership not the answer to every problem in everybodys life
7662764 ability to articulate the destination we should be headed as a country and to galvanize people to that destination
7662765 in our campaign in massachusetts and in barack obamas campaign nationally what he has done i believe is invite people who have checked out to check back in
7662766 there are more un enrolled independents in massachusetts than there are registered republicans and registered democrats combined
7662767 nobody is buying 100 percent of what either party is selling we dont have to agree on everything before we can work together on anything

7662775 that we were able to generate a 21 per cent increase in normalised earnings before interest and tax in such conditions is a reflection of the strength of our diversified financial services business

7662780 is the best means so far found for realizing ends that lie in the wide domain of human relationships and the development of human personality
7662781 to be a democrat is not to decide on a certain form of human association it is to learn how to live with other people

7662783 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7662784 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7662785 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7662786 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7662787 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7662788 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7662789 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7662790 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7662791 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7662792 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7662793 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7662794 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7662795 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7662796 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7662797 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7662798 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7662799 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7662800 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7662801 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7662802 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7662803 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7662804 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7662805 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7662806 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7662807 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7662808 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7662809 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7662810 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7662811 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7662812 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7662813 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7662814 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7662815 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7662816 discussions with the lenders on possible terms are at a preliminary stage and no specific proposal has been formulated the company said
7662817 other stakeholders to ensure the business could compete effectively in the local market
7662818 we are delighted with anzs approach and that it shares our confidence in the tricom business and the opportunities ahead mr rosenberg said
7662819 with backing from anz tricom will remain an independent broker and continue to operate a white label partnership with saxo bank
7662820 all our other businesses continue to perform well with volumes improving and having recently completed a number of successful equity raisings

7662822 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7662823 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7662824 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7662825 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7662826 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7662827 this ad does not reflect the sentiment of the thousands of former clinton supporters from my congressional district who have embraced barack obamas message of uniting americans and getting the country back on track
7662828 the democrats i talk to are supporting barack obama and joe biden because theyll end the political games of washington and provide real tax relief for working families address the energy crisis and restore americas respect abroad
7662829 i think hell be a bit embarrassed to see us all but hes been the world champion for so long and now finally hes got gold
7662830 its a very exciting time and its her first olympics shes been so inspirational
7662831 it is really nice to come home to a nice reception and theres nothing better than coming home

7662840 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7662841 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7662842 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

7662847 from the markets perspective this is such a drawn out process i dont think they are focusing on these individual events just yet
7662848 i think they are still getting to grips with the spectre that the commodities boom could be over

7662854 we only know the engine had problems and they did not make a successful landing
7662855 theres not a thing he can do at this point were working with the u s embassy to have all of the arrangements made for the repatriation of those who are deceased and medical flights for those living
7662856 there were farmers in the field where they crashed they pulled my husband out of the plane 30 seconds before the plane exploded
7662857 he has constant pain he says he can deal with hes just grateful to be alive
7662858 he did everything he was a carpenter a multipurpose utility player he was a very popular employee forever upbeat
7662859 he was very giving i think he was in africa last year
7662860 we recognize the pain suffered by mr healys family over his tragic passing
7662861 we hope the settlement brings them some measure of closure
7662862 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7662863 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7662864 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7662865 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7662866 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7662867 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7662868 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise
7662869 with the continuing decline of the ogallala aquifer water level and increasing cost of pumping water the use of drought tolerant and high yield corn hybrids is a key for sustainable corn production under limited irrigation
7662870 we hope to reduce the amount of water required for corn by at least 10 percent
7662871 the new multiple stress tolerant corn lines can be used to produce corn hybrids adapted to texas and other southern states
7662872 they can be a powerful tool to save water and produce crops with yield and grain quality under stressful environments
7662873 most of our breeding efforts start by crossing tropical corn with temperate elite lines
7662874 then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance agronomic productivity disease resistance insect resistance and value added grain characteristics
7662875 at 75 percent evapotranspiration you have 3 to 4 inches of available moisture that is used where if you are watering at 100 percent it is wasted
7662876 one of our experimental hybrids produced the same amount of silage in both locations when irrigation was reduced from 100 percent to 75 percent
7662877 developing and using new corn hybrids with improved tolerance to drought and other stresses is important and a viable water saving approach
7662878 our findings have important implications for both education and social policy
7662879 first they suggest that policies that change a childs exposure to classmates from troubled families will have important consequences for his or her education outcomes in addition the results also help provide a more complete measure of the social costs of family conflict
7662880 there are many reasons for disruptive classroom behavior domestic violence is one particularly good indicator of a troubled child
7662881 roommate relationships can be really good or they can be really bad and the fear is that theyll go from bad to worse
7662882 but our study shows that you can create a supportive relationship and turn the stranger whos your roommate into a friend
7662883 basically people who give support in response to another persons needs and out of concern for another persons welfare are most successful at building close relationships that they find supportive
7662884 the transition from high school to college is challenging for a variety of reasons
7662885 the academic environment is usually more difficult and more competitive and moving away from the nuclear family for the first time disrupts established social support networks
7662886 so these findings provide some good news students can be the architects of their roommate relationships enhancing or undermining the quality of these important relationships

7662896 we have to now prove ourselves we now have to build our credibility across the electorate and certainly weve started doing that since the formation of the lnp and we need to do that in parliament this week
7662897 this is the first sitting of the parliament for a number of months
7662898 the estimates committees process and the resolution of the budget will be one of the priorities this week as will the introduction of new legislation

7662912 eerst hebben we wim schaap die al eerder bij ons werkte gepolst of hij interesse had om het seizoen bij ons af te maken dat idee sprak hem wel aan maar er bleken nog een paar haakjes en oogjes aan te zitten voor wij 100 zekerheid konden hebben allereerst bleek wim schaap al een korte vakantie te hebben geboekt van zondag 29 januari t m zondag 5 februari dit houdt onder meer in dat ton jenner assistent trainer red de zaken waarneemt komende week en hoogstwaarschijnlijk a s zondag op de bank zit als we tegen haaglandia thuis spelen daarnaast moest er op het financi le vlak nog het n en ander geregeld worden met wims oude club westlandia wim is een man van principes terecht en wil dat wij eerst contact opnemen op dat punt met westlandia ik ga er vanuit dat tonegido er komende week financieel wel zal uitkomen met de westlanders zodat niets een terugkeer van wim schaap in de weg ligt
7662913 de basisconditie van de spelers is al aardig op peil
7662914 de meeste jongens zijn al op 12 juli begonnen met de looptraining onder leiding van maurice van veldhooven en er hebben er vijf met het westlands elftal getraind
7662915 iedereen krijgt in de voorbereiding de kans zich in de kijker te spelen
7662916 ik kijk ook naar vorig seizoen en zal jongens opstellen die het op basis daarvan verdienen om nu tegen top oss spelen
7662917 blessures of schorsingen kunnen we nu makkelijker opvangen ik heb meer keuze wat de basisopstelling betreft en dat is alleen maar mooi
7662918 we zullen messcherp moeten zijn en als we wat meer geluk hebben dan vorig jaar tegen eindhoven behoort een stuntje zeker tot de mogelijkheden
7662919 na 14 jaar jeugdtrainer te zijn geweest bij de s gravenzandse vv was ik op een punt aanbeland dat ik dacht dat ik het wel had gezien
7662920 ik werd benaderd door mensen van westlandia om trainer van de c jeugd te worden ik ben toen een keertje gaan kijken naar de c jeugd en was er vrij snel uit in tegenstelling tot twee jaar eerder toen ik mijn jawoord al aan rood wit had gegeven heb ik besloten om het te doen tussen het eerste gesprek en mijn aanstelling zat hooguit een week daar houd ik trouwens van bij westlandia wordt er niet te lang gewacht met de contractbesprekingen dat is maar goed ook dan is er voor beide partijen veel meer duidelijkheid voor komend seizoen hebben we ook weer de intentie uitgesproken met elkaar verder te gaan ik denk sowieso dat het belangrijk is om langer met jeugdtrainers te werken het geeft een stuk continu teit of zo je wilt een rode draad door de jeugdafdeling dat vind ik belangrijk daarbij heb je in de jeugd spelers nooit langer dan twee jaar onder je hoede dus raken spelers en trainers minder snel op elkaar uitgekeken
7662921 het klinkt misschien wel een beetje als een clich maar ik zag er toch wel een grote uitdaging in om bij westlandia aan de slag te gaan de club is een echt voetbalbolwerk met kwalitatief goede spelers en allemaal gediplomeerde jeugdtrainers in samenwerking met bestuur tc technische commissie red en aangestuurd door technisch jeugdco rdinator wilfred van leeuwen staat er een goede organisatie we hebben een echt team van selectietrainers die ook cht goed luisteren naar elkaars mening bij westlandia werken betekent voor mijzelf ook een ontwikkeling doormaken als jeugdtrainer hoe hoger het niveau is betekent dat je je meer met andere zaken kan en moet bezighouden ik ben nu veel meer met voetbaltactische zaken bezig meer met de manier van spelen en bijvoorbeeld minder met technische training want de spelers zijn hier qua techniek al een stuk verder spelers die uit de d jeugd komen daaraan kan je zien dat ze al enorm veel geleerd hebben
7662922 we hadden vorig seizoen een talentvolle spelersgroep en na de succesvol verlopen voorbereiding afgelopen zomer wist ik dat we ook dit jaar mee konden gaan doen om de prijzen
7662923 de groep wil ook echt vooruit ze weten dat ze om hogerop te kunnen komen dingen moeten doen n laten afbellen voor een training doen ze bijvoorbeeld nooit de c1 en c2 vormen een talentvolle groep en ze hebben veel spelplezier ze gaan goed met elkaar om wat ook heel belangrijk is kortom veel ambitieuze spelers met veel potentie dat heeft ook zijn aantrekkingskracht je ziet nu ook dat spelers via broertjes vriendjes of school hier terecht komen ze weten dat ze goede training krijgen bij een gezellige vereniging op een goed niveau
7662924 nee dat ervaar ik niet zo dat er scouts komen van bvos en spelers bij je weghalen betekent dat je met de jeugdopleiding op het goede spoor zit
7662925 en dat je ook echt bezig bent met zn allen om spelers beter te maken ik sta daarom ook helemaal achter het scoutingverhaal want een speler moet altijd op een zo hoog mogelijk niveau spelen dat is voor de individuele ontwikkeling alleen maar beter een speler die gescout is moet je dan ook goed begeleiden en succes toewensen bij zijn nieuwe club dan weet hij dat hij altijd weer kan terugkomen
7662926 de doelstelling is om met de eerste selectie elftallen 2e divisie te spelen en met de tweede elftallen eerste klasse ja de lat ligt hoog bij westlandia want uiteindelijk moeten er straks toch een aantal de a selectie en het eerste halen
7662927 het voorstel van de wethouder is onvoldoende met het geld dat door de gemeente nu wordt toegezegd kun je nog niet eens een tussenwoning in maasdijk kopen van dijk wilde inhoudelijk nog niet op het voorstel ingaan
7662928 de gemeente westland heeft voor deze aanpassingen simpelweg te weinig geld zei de wethouder
7662929 binnen onze mogelijkheden ligt nu het beste plan op tafel
7662930 dat is voor ons niet acceptabel reageert westlandia voorzitter ballering
7662931 de gemeente weigert ons voor het verlies van het veld en trainingscapaciteit te compenseren
7662932 maar dezelfde knvb deed ook de aanbeveling dat een club als westlandia zeker zes velden nodig heeft
7662933 mits aan een aantal voorwaarden wordt voldaan zegt olympus voorzitter rodenburg

7662941 if behavioral psychology was handmaid to the horrors perpetrated at guant namo bay abu ghraib and cia transnational black sites what new nightmares are in store for humanity when advances in neuroscience complex computer algorithms and a secretive national security state enter stage far right
7662942 would be how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight other questions raised by controlling the mind how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands as cognitive neuroscience and related technologies become more pervasive using technology for nefarious purposes becomes easier
7662943 the potential impact of neuroscience research is greater than previously thought
7662944 battlefield commanders of all nations hold sacrosanct the right to determine the applications
7662945 if governments or scientists were to try to develop a system to pre screen neuroscientific cognitive manipulators which would be hipaa approved and tested and robust in its core science success would be as likely as it was with mines and cluster bombs meaning not likely
7662946 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that someday there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
7662947 we laten ons afbluffen tonegido is een fysiek sterke ploeg die nogal eens de grenzen opzoekt die jonge ventjes van ons zijn daartegen niet opgewassen daarnaast geven we die goals veel te gemakkelijk weg
7662948 goede resultaten in een oefenperiode zijn leuk maar geen garantie voor een succesvol seizoen
7662949 zondag na de wedstrijd zal ik meer zeggen over deze keuze
7662950 we waren bij vlagen dominant maar lieten veel te veel kansen liggen

7662955 hahaha oh some people actually believe in things they have seen in a movie
7662956 hey i have not dreamt this weird thing i experienced
7662957 but i dont want to think of faith as something negative i think we need faith without faith and trust in something or someone it is hard to survive even if we do not believe in a religion or whatever we still need to feel faith from others and to feel this belief in that we can trust
7662958 the fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one
7662959 if i would present evidence that they in ancient egypt had scriptures that is almost exactly the same story as about jesus and the son of god but with other names and slighty different scenery etc they would probably call me a demon even if i would say that i find the essenece of the faith appealing that there is something holy within the creation of life and that we need to be careful and treat each other well etc etc bla bla blind faith and open minded faith
7662960 i dont think a religious person should be treated with more respect then a non believer we should all respect each other just because we call ourself religious we are not good or kind or supernatural lords of the universe on the contrary these so often hippocritic superficial superegos are doing more harm then good to others since religion is used as an excuse to kill others i hate that but still i do have faith in mankind otherwise life would be meaningless for me
7662961 yes i see how some might think and react on that the world is
7662962 but the fact that some geniuses were laughed at does not imply that all who are laughed at are geniuses they laughed at columbus they laughed at fulton they laughed at the wright brothers but they also laughed at bozo the clown
7662963 i should like very much for some of these things to be true but there simply isnt anything to persuade one that they are
7662964 but what if you yourself would have a personal experience of a encounter with some of these things i myself are talking about
7662965 a true friend tells you when you are dirty in the face
7662966 i wonder about this science and research we put so much faith in if i may express myself that way why do we people believe in science
7662967 science is a tool to make us believe in something am i right
7662968 the evidence and the facts we put our faith in as scientists are statistic and numbers things we can measure
7662969 with that in mind i cannot say i am correct can i can i ever can you
7662970 but what if you yourself would have a personal experience of a encounter with some of these things i myself are talking about a real spaceship and then would you dare to even tell anyone about it if you could not present evidence as in photos videoclip or metalobjects or other traces from the spaceship in question
7662971 interesting that you work with fantasy etc may i know more
7662972 i have not read the books lord of the rings so yes i will not pretend i understand how tolkien thought
7662973 who would believe us if we told them people would laugh and say we had made up a lame story
7662974 no now is everything that might possibly be discovered already found so now we dont have to have open mind anymore
7662975 who would believe us if we told them people would laugh and say we had made up a lame story
7662976 audiences heard their regularly scheduled broadcast interrupted by breaking news
7662977 this story is very shocking indeed philip schneider was a engineer who worked for the us government and in the last few years of his life revealed many secrets about what has being covered up as a result he was murdered for this in 1996 here is the lecture recorded 6 months before his death
7662978 re lost lecture of phil schneider which he was murdered for
7662979 by 1900 it was one of the most powerful banking houses of the world carrying through many deals especially reorganizations and consolidations
7662980 in 1895 at the depths of the panic of 1893 the federal treasury was nearly out of gold president grover cleveland arranged for morgan to create a private syndicate on wall street to supply the u s treasury with 65 million in gold half of it from europe to float a bond issue that restored the treasury surplus of 100 million the episode saved the treasury but hurt cleveland with the agrarian wing of his democratic party and became an issue in the election of 1896 when banks came under withering attack from william jennings bryan morgan and wall street bankers donated heavily to republican william mckinley who was elected in 1896 and reelected in 1900 on a gold standard platform 4 in 1902 j p morgan amp co purchased the leyland line of atlantic steamships and other british lines creating an atlantic shipping combine the international mercantile marine company which eventually became the owner of white star line builder and operator of rms titanic

7662986 ik kreeg de bal op het middenveld en passeerde op volle snelheid een tegenstander
7662987 toen stond ik al voor de keeper en met een bekeken schuiver schoot ik de bal binnen op dat moment besefte ik nog niet echt wat er gebeurde ik zat echt in een roes maar na afloop begreep ik dat het een unieke prestatie was
7662988 in de kantine van westlandia zaten ze naar radio rijnmond te luisteren en iedereen begonnen spontaan te bellen en smsen echt fantastisch ik heb heel veel reacties gehad
7662989 het is een heel gemoedelijke club en de sfeer in de selectie is uitstekend dat komt ook omdat we uit de eerste drie wedstrijden zeven punten hebben gehaald dat scheelt natuurlijk ook
7662990 het is natuurlijk wel een verschil want ik ben van drie keer trainen per week naar zes of zeven keer gegaan we hebben een trainingskamp gehad waar we elke dag twee keer trainden dus toen kon ik me al aardig aanpassen het is wel zwaar maar niet zwaarder dan ik had gedacht
7662991 mijn school is nog niet begonnen dus ik heb nu de middag lekker vrij we trainen s ochtends als ik straks naar school ga wordt dat anders mijn school is op vijf minuten loopafstand van de club en ik zit in een topsportklas dat is dus prima te combineren met het voetballen
7662992 mario been is tevreden over me en heeft gezegd dat als het vanavond goed gaat met de ploeg tegen omniworld dat ik wat meer speeltijd krijg ik ben bovendien de enige aanvaller op de bank dat vergroot de kans op speeltijd ook
7662993 hij staat een beetje bekend als een geinponem en je kunt inderdaad ontzettend met hem lachen maar als het moet is hij heel serieus met zijn vak bezig hij analyseert tegenstanders heel goed en weet daar heel veel van het is een echt voetbaldier en hij komt regelmatig een praatje met me maken over wat ik wel en niet goed doe ik kan ontzettend veel van hem leren net als van marinus dijkhuizen

7662996 este equipo no est acostumbrado a recibir tantos goles normalmente somos el equipo menos goleado y ahora siete goles en dos partidos lo que debemos hacer es ocuparnos en corregir los desaciertos

7663070 fiat per 4000 lavoratori le vacanze non sono finite abruzzo report
7663071 michelle wrote her own stump speech and you know shes refining it now i think as were going into the general election
7663072 we have an opportunity for her to kind of step back and think about the message she wants to deliver so shes really working on it as we speak
7663073 with a developer or studio who wants to make it happen
7663074 was a bisexual engaged in sordid sexual activities and had repeated sexual encounters with a 13 year old girl
7663075 whether the book sex rebel is entirely based on davis or not the controversy certainly demonstrates that davis had a perverted sexual interest and should not have been trusted as a mentor for any young person
7663076 makes no mention of daviss sex rebel book and his interest in pornography
7663077 completely ignores the fact that davis was obamas mentor and adviser for a significant number of those years
7663078 my reporting conclusion was the role of frank had been hyped out of all proportion both by obama himself in his book and some others later he did not play a role in really shaping obama
7663079 treasure blue continues and solidifies his position as the true heir to iceberg slim and donald goines a book full of gritty realism violence drug abuse and hope the book is simply off the damn hook

7663081 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7663082 yes there is major progress on the issue of the negotiations on the security deal
7663083 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7663084 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement
7663085 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and national interests of iraq
7663086 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and cannot grant full immunity
7663087 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament
7663088 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
7663089 goh dat zou ik eigenlijk ook wel eens moeten doen dat windsurfen
7663090 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7663091 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7663092 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7663093 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7663094 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7663095 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7663096 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7663097 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7663098 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7663099 we werent ready to buy before it just happened the market went down and we were just happy that prices have fallen down for us
7663100 weve basically been going through this standoff between buyers and sellers

7663107 yeah that was funny and did you notice that when michael looked to the right of his desk jim slightly craned his neck and it looked like he was winking at pam wow what does that mean

7663109 a vote for mccain is a vote for continuing the failed policies of george w

7663111 get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me you do not have in mind the things of god but the things of men
7663112 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
7663113 you are the christ the son of the living god
7663114 jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders chief priests and teachers of the law and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life
7663115 from that time on jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders chief priests and teachers of the law and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life
7663116 no jesus ill take your weighty preaching and your impressive miracles but whats this talk about a gruesome death no jesus may god have mercy on you and never let that be
7663117 jesus turned and said to peter get behind me satan
7663118 must go to jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders chief priests and teachers of the law and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life
7663119 no lord this shall never be the message we preach about you
7663120 hey pete not a bad idea i really wasnt looking forward to the cross anyway
7663121 jesus said to his disciples if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
7663122 what good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world yet forfeits his soul or what can a man give in exchange for his soul
7663123 these findings suggest that it is important children first learn how to calculate answers on their own but after that initial phase using calculators is a fine thing to do even for basic multiplication facts
7663124 the study indicates technology such as calculators can help kids who already have a strong foundation in basic skills
7663125 for students who did not know many multiplication facts generating the answers on their own without a calculator was important and helped their performance on subsequent tests
7663126 but for students who already knew some multiplication facts it didnt matter using a calculator to practice neither helped nor harmed them
7663127 teachers struggle with how to give kids immediate feedback which we know speeds the learning process so another use for calculators is allowing students to use them to check the answers they have come up with by themselves giving them immediate feedback and more time for practice
7663128 kids enjoyed them its one way to make memorizing your multiplication facts a more interesting thing to do
7663129 so much of how you teach depends on how you market the material presentation is very important to kids
7663130 many of these students had never used a calculator before so it added a fun aspect to math class for them
7663131 its a good tool that some teachers shy away from because they are worried its going to have negative consequences
7663132 i think that the evidence suggests there are good uses of calculators even in elementary school
7663133 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa

7663136 theres nothing wrong with having the prettiest little girl representing the country
7663137 you must always create the best impression to represent your country a perfect face and one that can act
7663138 they got the perfect voice the perfect face and think they can just put them together and make a perfect result typical chinese
7663139 looks are still 1 so they should have just trained the pretty little girl to sing good enough
7663140 as long as she was in tune people would forgive a pretty face who can act besides there was a lot of noise in that stadium anyway
7663141 that may be the case at other companies but it is not the case at our company
7663142 deep and irrefutable flaws are built into our present system of capital punishment these flaws hold the most risk for those at the margins of society
7663143 the penalty for conviction in capital cases should be changed to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole until we are willing or able to provide the resources to stop these frightfully tragic miscarriages of justice
7663144 as a lawyer and former u s attorney i have both prosecuted and defended

7663151 unfortunately there is a flourishing industry designed to help people facilitate continuing drug use
7663152 the only way we can get around that is to do a visual inspection
7663153 to allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns to surrender to too many demands to commit oneself to too many projects to want to help everyone in everything is to succumb to the violence of our times

7663160 i had a red bag and was wearing black pants and a long denim coat i am an asian american woman

7663166 now under thai law they can seize my house and leave me to live on the street
7663167 the shocking truth is that 37 of tescos income comes from thailand
7663168 because of the complexity of accounting which can deduct a lot of expenses and show low profit
7663169 for the provision of know how and the use of brand and trademarks
7663170 to control the expansion of foreign owned retail superstores in order to protect small local retailers
7663171 tesco have the upper hand in thailand many consumers support them because they think its convenient to shop in tesco and the fresh food markets are out of date and old fashioned
7663172 felt we had no choice after a sustained campaign of misinformation
7663173 we condemn tescos tactic of issuing defamation writs against those who dare to criticise its aggressive expansion plans in thailand
7663174 tescos bid to silence its critics should be vigorously opposed by all those who believe in freedom of expression the chilling effect of such actions would be to deny the public the right to know about the practices of major corporations
7663175 tesco is displaying an extraordinary amount of intolerance over what is legitimate journalistic scrutiny it is very high handed of them to take this approach
7663176 tesco does not have a policy of using legal action to silence its critics
7663177 in thailand tesco lotus has been seriously defamed in a sustained and malicious campaign over a number of months
7663178 in both cases we have been left no option other than to take legal action a step we would not consider unless we believed it was entirely justified we still hope the matters can be resolved by agreement but if not we will have to resort to the courts to restore our reputation
7663179 defending the british crown commonwealth and the english speaking peoples splendour without diminishment
7663180 i did it its sort of like shopping with training wheels and shopping as everyone knows is what we are born to do
7663181 i started thinking about that when i expanded rinkya the largest japanese shopping service to add internet malls and stores such as rakuten and amazon to the shopping choices available at rinkya as well as the rinkya blog i mean like its being in the mall hanging out with your friends on the blog window shopping with your mouse or maybe im just a valley girl at heart and wanted the whole wide world as my mall
7663182 the choices available from the internet malls and stores of japan is truly mind blowing
7663183 what weve noticed lately is the run on japanese street fashion internationally
7663184 a lot of the virtual valley girls and boys click through the fashions and other goods that are available in japan just like they were in a mall
7663185 well they say the deepest part of the ocean is in the middle of the pacific ocean so were all really in a big valley at rinkya were building a mall for that valley a place to hang out have some fun and most of all to shop after all shopping is the noblest expression of the human spirit everyone shops it brings the world together all together in one big valley hanging out in a virtual mall like its the place to be fer sure
7663186 it was a pleasure and privilege to work on the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya
7663187 there was a funny and kind of surreal moment during the initial casting process when i had to introduce the u s voice actress wendee lee to aya hirano who played the lead role in the original japanese version and also to patty lee who played haruhi in the bandai usa produced asos brigade videos i was faced with three haruhis and for a moment i felt like i was in the anime itself kind of in this other dimension where the time continuum was broken it was a funny haruhi moment
7663188 there is always a moment during the casting process when the character stops being merely animated and the voice actor brings that persona to life the way an actor portrays certain emotions with confidence and believability lets me know they have an intrinsic understanding of a particular characters personality and motivations
7663189 many of these series have a ton of incidentals and bit parts and they take a lot of time to cast you cant bring in individuals to play each and every bit so you have to make casting decisions in a way that is not only best for the role no matter how small but also makes sure that actors dont end up talking to themselves on screen its not always easy to do and demands a solid understanding of both the original japanese version as well as whats required for the new north american dub
7663190 recognition like this is very gratifying and shows how much the fans and industry support the job we did on the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya
7663191 the employees are under extreme pressure there are not enough people resources and incentives to achieve product differentiation quickly in order to achieve the necessary large scale success in the multimedia field
7663192 as the editors in chief we would like to stress that our papers are not just an economic product
7663193 we are also a cultural element and this is the key factor in the core value of our product the newspapers are more than an information provider for the inhabitants of the relevant regions they are a bearer of historical and cultural awareness and social cohesion
7663194 the employees are under extreme pressure there are not enough people resources and incentives to achieve product differentiation quickly in order to achieve the necessary large scale success in the multimedia field
7663195 as the editors in chief we would like to stress that our papers are not just an economic product
7663196 we are also a cultural element and this is the key factor in the core value of our product the newspapers are more than an information provider for the inhabitants of the relevant regions they are a bearer of historical and cultural awareness and social cohesion
7663197 seven day a week advice columns about personal technology vastly increased coverage and criticism of other media particularly entertainment television a return of the old action columns in which we mediate disputes and avenge bitter consumers more gossip and of course blogs blogs blogs
7663198 the bottom line is that this critically endangered species needs our help
7663199 noaas decision on these measures is based on the best data and scientific understanding available
7663200 what we have seen over and over again where economics and partisanship and political interests bump up against the science science loses
7663201 tragically our products have been linked to illnesses and loss of life
7663202 theres no evidence of listeria contamination in our products beyond the production lines originally under investigation
7663203 i think that as theyve acted extremely responsibly after a short while the consumers will forget about it theyve got a very short memory
7663204 its an exciting time to join ford of canada as we accelerate plans to introduce new fuel efficient vehicles especially small cars and crossovers which are exactly what canadian consumers are asking for
7663205 i look forward to working closely with the ford of canada dealers to ensure we are not only meeting but exceeding customer expectations as we introduce the new products
7663206 thats just a crazy way to spend 250 million compared with all the other needs you have in health care let alone education or anything else
7663207 we think our service can be a step above what consumers enjoy today in the industry
7663208 we also know the dry cleaning industry is very large and its here to stay and we believe we can offer something for unmet needs
7663209 theyve got too much stuff on their plate and i dont think theyre going to get that involved in dry cleaning
7663210 we wanted a show where the music was relevant to the culture at large and not just within the confines of the musical theater
7663211 my immediate thought was spring awakening it was 1999 everyone was having millennial thoughts and i thought a great way to look forward would be by looking back this story just struck my heart
7663212 a straight shot of eroticism has steamed open under the innocuous name of spring awakening and broadway may never be the same
7663213 he he dared to tell the truth at a time when that kind of truth telling just wasnt done were in a similar place in our society now where there are a lot of heads buried in the sand
7663214 the bitch of living the musicals creators pay tribute to the spirit of the original
7663215 wedekind was about adolescent angst the way adolescents now deal with their angst is they listen to indie rock and emo so what better way of channeling the angst of 1891 german kids than to send them into this kind of alternate reality where they become rock stars in their bedrooms
7663216 we were trying to make sure that what we did had integrity
7663217 and was progressive and was true to the spirit of frank wedekind but was yes trying to bring a new audience to the theater
7663218 i love the fact that the brackets of musical theater are being expanded
7663219 and should more accurately be called hormonal awakening i am of the older generation its not for me
7663220 the experience of becoming an adult and moving out of childhood transcends time and place
7663221 this is when you start to define yourself and the world starts to define you the changes you are experiencing physically emotionally socially and in every other way are so extreme that inevitably things are triggered you start to become the person you are
7663222 nationwide its too new for us to go from a slap on the wrist to the death penalty
7663223 there had to be an intermediate step and thats what weve chosen here
7663224 it was kind of like if you foul a guy under the basket you get thrown out of the game
7663225 our sense is that the potential impact from parity pay in the u k market likely wouldnt be very dramatic as compensation for robert half internationals temp employees is probably not too far away from an equivalent permanent employee
7663226 the concern is that state entities are using taxpayers money to lobby when that entitys managers have the expert knowledge to respond to any information needs that the legislature might have
7663227 the money used for contract lobbyists could be used for ongoing programs and services
7663228 the taxpayers have a right to know where their moneys going how its being spent
7663229 i want to tell you about my other job i call it career councilor there are thousands of people in this country who need a new job sally kern was mentioned earlier she has a fantastic career ahead of her just not in what shes doing now the only way bigots are going to learn is if we take their power away from them
7663230 obama has engaged the creative community in a way unseen before
7663231 archbishop burkes great love and zeal for our lord in the blessed sacrament compels him to send a clear message dont desecrate the holy eucharist by presenting yourself for communion while persisting in your support of child murder
7663232 we are excited to see archbishop burke continuing to battle for the lives of innocent preborn children
7663233 support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives
7663234 should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
7663235 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather with the concern of the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
7663236 we thank archbishop burke for his clear teaching in regard to pro abortion politicians who call themselves catholic
7663237 it is our hope that more catholic bishops will follow his lead and dispel the confusion and darkness of the culture of death in which we live
7663238 it was thanks to him that the fire did not spread any further
7663239 i was amazed ive never seen him move so fast hes the last person youd expect to have such a lightning reaction to anything unless it was illegal but he stopped the situation from getting any worse

7663269 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7663270 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7663271 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7663272 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7663273 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions

7663291 before i started doing acceleration training i had never done any conditioning and weight lifting
7663292 i really enjoyed the training and could tell i was benefiting from the program
7663293 ogonna was very aware that she needed to continue to work on her conditioning and we spent a lot of time in the summers working on her explosiveness

7663369 in order to get this condition accepted every other part of your offer needs to be very strong when were representing a seller and we receive a subject to sale offer we will generally advise our clients to counter strong the sellers really have nothing to lose since the likelihood of the deal actually going together is slim to none so as a buyer you end up in a weak negotiating position and will likely have to pay top dollar with a large deposit and tight time frames on your other conditions in fact you could very easily end up paying for an inspection only to lose the home to another party

7663377 how did you manage to end up here in florida
7663378 actually after my assignment in new york i was sent to iraq to help locate saddams wmds we all know what happened with that i was returned to the states only to be called back to iraq to help search for the deposed iraqi leader im mighty proud to say i was there when he was he found i was in afghanistan for a very brief time in my opinion there was no need for the u s to bomb the place the soviets had already done a devastating job on the terrain
7663379 after that final tour in iraq and my short visit to afghanistan i was brought to florida my new owner found me at a local kennel and just like my other owners she was unaware of my ability to verbally communicate with humans until one day she left a piece of dark chocolate within reach of my food dish and i said hey lady you know chocolate for dogs is like arsenic to humans when she overcame her surprise she removed the poison threat and weve been talking ever since
7663380 please excuse me i must speak to your mistress about making you my new pet ive just got to have a dog like you

7663389 now that the viewing figures are lower on the tv everywhere i go someone will come up to me and say what a huge fan they are that just tells me that people watch the show in a more modern way and that it has reached its sort of critical mass
7663390 tivo had just sort of taken off this was four or five seasons ago and because we were on friday nights most people most fans dont watch it on first run they tivo it and watch it a zillion times
7663391 in fact i dont think we ever go into space
7663392 its really about big business the machinations and the subterfuge that go on inside of it when you have something that is groundbreaking and could change the nature of life and the future
7663393 its about a vibrant society its really at the height of its power and the height of its decadence at the same time
7663394 so its really a thriving vibrant culture thats going to come apart as we watch but its sort of the roller coaster its thrilling at the top when you see how far down youve got to go

7663461 some will forget that the main reason for government to exist is for the protection of liberty carefully considered government and liberty should not be separated what might appear to be a desire for the rights of the people often proves to be a true desire for the power and ambition of men the desire for a strong government does not tempt men quite so much to this sort of dangerous ambition history teaches us that a concern for the strength of government offers less of a threat to liberty history shows that most people who are responsible for undermining the liberty of republics start their careers by seducing the people they start out as great speakers manipulating the people with prejudice and emotion but they end up as tyrants

7663520 when you go the airport thats security where you try to get through as quickly as you can

7663536 north carolina is not immune to whats happening in the economy
7663537 the unemployment rate increased because the number of people in the labor force has increased at a faster rate than what the economy could absorb so the unemployment rate is going to increase
7663538 we dont have enough of them in some ways if you have a company that comes into a town and hires 1 thousand people thats a big piece of the work force and one thousand people in eastern north carolina is a lot more than 1 000 people in charlotte or raleigh

7663549 dancing staff are fun though an older staff member seemed to be exhorting them to dance it should be voluntary and spontaneous i think otherwise a little creepy especially to pyt
7663550 very friendly staff explained the whole concept to us and waited patiently while we stood around and pondered the many toppings lots of interesting elements to choose from they include chocolate bars ranging from mars bars to toblerone and ferrero rocher to fresh and dried fruit to licorice and other candy as well as various syrups
7663551 they arent really milkshakes the concept is that you choose a size a base either vanilla ice cream soy ice cream or yoghurt and then toppings from the aforementioned extensive toppings bar and then they blend it up for you either as a milkshake or as a sundae we got milkshakes or so we thought but actually what we got was closest to a dq blizzard now i like those things but they arent milkshakes you figure a place called millions of milkshakes should serve at least one
7663552 their pricing is also off base you pay 5 for the base for a regular size then 95 cents for each topping so even a minimal regular shake is about 7 dollars bottom line though it costs too much i dont want an 8 milkshake and if i did it better blow my socks off
7663553 its all a bit overwhelming we all stood there for a good 5 minutes maybe 10 just staring at it all trying to figure out what to do
7663554 if the negotiations dont get much more dramatic quickly i will extricate myself from the process
7663555 at the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved
7663556 we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money

7663561 noaa is looking forward to taking a significant step in our efforts to protect right whales
7663562 our scientific analysis shows that a 10 knot speed limit in critical areas will significantly reduce the threat to these endangered marine mammals
7663563 the bottom line is that this critically endangered species needs our help
7663564 the preferred alternative is a balanced approach grounded in science that would significantly enhance our ability to protect right whales but it would also take into account concerns about the safety of ship crews and the impact on an important segment of our economy
7663565 everyone was in uniforms they looked so nice the parents were so excited and happy
7663566 i know of some parents that called me this morning asking where they can get vouchers from because they didnt have any uniforms for the kids and they actually kept kids from school today
7663567 i thought that was great because its hard to get uniforms you need more than one

7663574 offered me rs 30 000 to spend a night with him at a hotel
7663575 so what if he didnt fancy me it is a bit upsetting but im going to talk to him when i get out and ask why
7663576 would you let him put a pillow on your head
7663577 he says i try to do it to entertain people and act up to it
7663578 about mo i said how i feel and he said its not all about you
7663579 why does it have to be me all the time
7663580 he doesnt want to say something stupid youve got to understand darnells reasoning
7663581 if its a task im definitely going to be out 100
7663582 if its in the bottom two i will be one of them
7663583 i dunno maybe it is just me but i was frankly a little underwhelmed by the celebrity list although i will tune in to see cloris leachman she is so spry for an 82 year old
7663584 what would you do if you received 50 messages or more per week from different senders offering products or services you do not want

7663587 its pretty safe to assume that the operating systems image problems with the general public will soon be a thing of the past
7663588 if the allegations are proven then of course his future in the club and in the game will come into question
7663589 at this stage the best solution for all parties is that the legal process is allowed to unfold with greg off the field
7663590 we acknowledge that the club is taking the matter extremely seriously
7663591 it was pretty cut and dried circumstances and the matters were not contested by the player
7663592 from what i understand happened this morning at court greg and his counsel said theyd be strongly defending the allegations its a slightly different situation
7663593 certainly if theres a full admission then clubs are able to act more quickly than otherwise
7663594 he certainly wont be training or playing with the nrl team and id say its highly unlikely hed be playing again this year
7663595 theyre very disappointed but were basically at the 30km mark of a marathon and were not going back to the starting blocks
7663596 certainly we would respect and support any ban the club has on the player
7663597 people already understand the threat but the urgency of the threat is something were trying to bring home by pointing out the facts of what the outcome could be if we do nothing

7663615 we hope this sends a message that young democrats in new york are here in force and will continue to be a strong voice in new york politics for years to come
7663616 we would hope as we move forward that we can get young people to run and become delegates in the future
7663617 my fervent hope is that mental giants like kevin kearney keep doing what they are doing as often as possible before mating that way the gene pool will be cleansed and eventually such stupid behavior will be as extinct as the idiots who take such chances

7663625 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7663626 ive had time to get my head around the fact that people do actually want to talk to me so im getting used to that aspect
7663627 but at the same time its going to die down because in five weeks time ill be back in the pool at five oclock in the morning and people arent going to be wanting interviews and photographs then i can guarantee you that
7663628 i think kelly was very different she had already had honours
7663629 against chris hoy no chance even im star struck by him
7663630 absolutely brilliant so honest and thats what i love about her
7663631 if i spend the next couple of years doing the three events then its going to be great preparation for london
7663632 once you get to the top end to olympic competition swimming is quite expensive you do get the odd suit free but its mainly the competition fees for our olympic trials you have to have hotel costs food costs transport costs covered just to get into the event
7663633 it does add up and so to have my equipment sponsored would just relieve my parents of a lot of stress they contribute absolutely everything at the minute i owe them a lot of money
7663634 it has been an extremely difficult decision to take given my burning desire to represent europe again in defending the ryder cup in the united states
7663635 but the fact that boston this week is my only opportunity to qualify for the final two play off events as well as being my final opportunity to play my 15 events on the us pga tour conflicts with my ambition to play gleneagles and earn my spot in the team

7663640 do you think there should be a gc in leipzig in 2009
7663641 anyone who has experienced the enthusiastic mood in the exhibition halls over the last seven years knows this fair belongs in leipzig
7663642 the fairs and conferences in leipzig are becoming increasingly international and attract more and more visitors were pleased with this development i completely agree with the governor of the free state of saxony stanislaw tillich that we will do everything to help this new cultural sector and the gc games convention to achieve further success
7663643 the concept is flexible and the network of the global games industry permits us to be active at different locations after the southeast asian games convention we are now focusing on the north american market

7663645 get in your i suppose i had nothing to say a year ago today
7663646 we had a bit of bad luck early on in the season and that knocked my confidence a bit
7663647 winning that first race here was a relief and a pleasure and then it got even better for me they were hard races but fantastic
7663648 i knew i had to do it again so i am pleased that i got it out of the way in the opener and then could enjoy the second race but tom sykes made me work hard in both

7663658 weve got mounds of evidence that an extremely powerful and unprecedented climate driven change is underway
7663659 these changes are underway and there are more changes coming

7663662 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7663663 we realize that over the last week or 10 days that john mccain has had a 12 and 0 run here in this basketball game but we know the momentum can shift and its going to shift starting in denver
7663664 making clothes together in our studio makes us feel complete we probably sound like a group of grannies in a knitting circle but its the truth and it gives us some control over our visual identity
7663665 we see if they have a sewing kit in the amenities drawer in case we feel inspired
7663666 when you are a big band and everyone is taking shots at you the more things you can do together the better and if youre wearing uniforms made by your own hands it helps achieve that
7663667 felt saying that to get something less trying to get out of it not admit to it
7663668 the fact that someone did rape her at the morgue doesnt do anything to lessen guilt of david steffen he should die for the crimes committed
7663669 he admitted he broke into home murdered almost cut head off ripped clothes admitted he wanted to rape but wasnt able
7663670 i believe maybe the penalty should stand as it is
7663671 yes boys do sleep like babies too not with me but they will with you you are incredible tall and caramel and freckled demure and spiritual someone who will not settle for a life of flats you are what you love not what loves you back

7663714 the first draft of the master plan was the most exciting part of the meeting
7663715 the jaeger co took archeological work to develop recommendations regarding sites that should be developed into everything from roadside kiosks to full scale restoration of battlefields
7663716 the archeological report reflects a great achievement in and of itself in that it represents the first comprehensive survey of the archeological record related to francis marion
7663717 this will tell us about where marion was what his troops were eating and other things its going to add tremendously to our body of knowledge
7663718 we are starting to get the structure of this project put in place
7663719 we will have both the archeology and master plans once the interpretive plan comes out this fall
7663720 i hope we will have the money for the interpretive plan this is the next phase which will tell the story what the exhibits look like and much more
7663721 the industry and visitors are giving us their clear support to continue with the fair in leipzig

7663729 heh now that im blogrolled on libertarian leanings ill really get the traffic
7663730 in january 2007 obama claimed that the iraqi government would make no hard choices if the united states stayed
7663731 if obama was wrong about the tactical gains that would be made by the new strategy and wrong about how the iraqi political leaders will react can his larger theory about how iraqis will respond to a troop pullout remain intact

7663786 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7663787 this response ad is more smoke and mirrors from a candidate desperate to obscure his long standing relationship with admitted domestic terrorist william ayers
7663788 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could

7663839 as to whether well continue with traditional transistors or whether well move to a surface device such as tri gate transistors that weve been talking about now for at least the last four or five years
7663840 its a very important as important as high k metal gate because once youre on the surface youre going to have a much wider choice of materials and you can build conventional cmos devices with tri gate transistors which are essentially just better cmos transistors
7663841 its sometime in that next decade after the transition to surface cmos technology around the time when were making 10nm devices that we want to start looking at other quantum properties
7663842 historically weve not been able to look more than a decade out and it takes around a decade to perfect the use of these new materials for example our work in high k started about a decade ago and thats a good measure for how long these technology advancements take

7663871 s la roma ha reagito molto bene nel primo tempo i nerazzurri hanno giocato molto bene mentre nella seconda frazione i capitolini hanno interpretato meglio la gara meritando quantomeno il pareggio poi ci vuole anche fortuna per vincere i trofei
7663872 se non altro si dimostra veramente furbo aldil di tutto
7663873 beh venendo a mancare la panchina dellinter in italia non era possibile trovare altro juve milan e roma gi prenotate cos come lazio e fiorentina insomma o andava allestero o rimaneva fermo

7663902 when an indian child has been brought up among us taught our language and habituated to our customs yet if he goes to see his relations and make one indian ramble with them there is no perswading them ever to return but when white persons of either sex have been taken prisoners young by the indians and lived a while among them tho ransomed by their friends and treated with all imaginable tenderness to prevail with them to stay among the english yet in a short time they become disgusted with our manner of life and the care and pains that are necessary to support it and take the first good opportunity of escaping again into the woods from whence there is no reclaiming them

7663956 safe effective pro organic no artifical color synthetic fragrance or parabens
7663957 we have a mayor who is refusing to abide by the rules set forth by krs for the operation of our form of government and weve got to get that under control if were going to function as a team and move this city forward
7663958 efforts to reduce abortions or to create alternatives to abortion or to foster an environment where more women will choose to keep their unborn child can have great merit
7663959 if they serve to cover over or distract from the brutality and fundamental injustice of abortion itself
7663960 obviously we have other important issues facing us this fall the economy the war in iraq immigration justice
7663961 but we cant build a healthy society while ignoring the routine and very profitable legalized homicide that goes on every day against americas unborn children
7663962 the right to life is foundational every other right depends on it
7663963 we should remember that one of the crucial things that set early christians apart from the pagan culture around them was their rejection of abortion and infanticide
7663964 yet for thirty five years ive watched prominent pro choice catholics justify themselves with the kind of moral and verbal gymnastics that should qualify as an olympic event
7663965 all theyve really done is capitulate to roe v wade
7663966 tend to take a hard line in talking about the separation of church and state but their idea of separation often seems to work one way
7663967 in fact some officials also seem comfortable in the role of theologian and that warrants some interest not as a political issue but as a matter of accuracy and justice
7663968 a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills
7663969 regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7663970 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7663971 she must know very well one of the premier works on the subject jesuit john connerys abortion the development of the roman catholic perspective loyola 1977
7663972 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7663973 the blunter words of the great lutheran pastor dietrich bonhoeffer
7663974 the destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
7663975 ardent practicing catholics will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil in the absence of modern medical knowledge some of the early fathers held that abortion was homicide others that it was tantamount to homicide and various scholars theorized about when and how the unborn child might be animated or ensouled but none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
7663976 we now know with biological certainty exactly when human life begins thus todays religious alibis for abortion and a so called right to choose are nothing more than that alibis that break radically with historic christian and catholic belief
7663977 abortion kills an unborn developing human life it is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
7663978 the duty of the state and its officials is to serve the common good which is always rooted in moral truth a proper understanding of the separation of church and state does not imply a separation of faith from political life but of course its always important to know what our faith actually teaches
7663979 right now all too often your questions are brushed aside
7663980 what they dont need is another governmental intrusion into the relationship between themselves and their doctor
7663981 pictures of him and jen were selling for 20 000 at one point a picture of him alone gets 200 now
7663982 were moving quick because the demand for our cars and the orders have been tremendous
7663983 the time is right to be involved in something thats sort of on the cutting edge of our whole countrys refocus on alternative sources of energy and energy independence
7663984 im hoping that someday out there in the future franklin may be known for this plant like georgetown is for toyota it has that kind of potential and were really excited about it
7663985 a huge demonstration of faith in this states economic climate
7663986 it seems likely that very few tax dollars are going to go to them any time soon troske told action news 36 monday
7663987 we made very limited promises in terms of monetary value so it would seem to me it would be a risk working taking
7663988 the state is getting its foot in the door if this does become a reliable technology
7663989 well they are doing the best they can i mean this is a lot of people
7663990 what the fuck are you talking about thats like picking up a six pack of beer and then inviting 12 of your best friends over
7663991 we bought this album for the album cover for here is what lust looked like in 1966
7663992 they said it was the biggest turnout theyve ever had at seattles experience music project

7663996 amazon coms revolutionary wireless reading device now has more than 160 000 books plus top newspapers and blogs available and is more affordable than ever with this limited time offer from chase
7663997 im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
7663998 people know that i can give the kind of speech that i gave four years ago thats not the question on voters mind i think theyre much more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives
7663999 and so in that sense this is going to be a more workman like speech
7664000 theres not a liberal america and a conservative america theres the united states of america
7664001 theres not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
7664002 you know 2004 i think was unique nobody knew who i was and i think even up to the time that i walked onto the stage and we had handed out obama signs people were thinking what is this
7664003 i dont think you can duplicate that kind of moment
7664004 she is on her way to the little country of georgia
7664005 russian aggression is now basically trying to dismember that country in many ways
7664006 this is very concerning because whats happened is that the right to die or the euthanasia lobby has decided that they would focus on one state and focus all their resources in one state and they chose washington state because of its demographics
7664007 if washington state passes euthanasia not only does that create a second state it changes the momentum against us
7664008 it will see new court decisions which will open up assisted suicide in a far wider way and a lot more lives will be lost and a lot more vulnerable people will be threatened by this
7664009 you know who makes me laugh chris rock but i dont want him as president
7664010 barack obama could cure cancer and they would paint it as an economic disaster
7664011 i think that there will be plenty of jokes to be had
7664012 we are having to introduce him to 20 year olds who are smoking out of apple bongs
7664013 we leaned heavily on zippy zipadelli and i think zippy from day 1 thought joey had the talent to get this done
7664014 the bottom line was that joey said hey to be quite truthful every minute you take away from me in the car i think i would be gaining experience i dont think i would benefit from having someone else coaching me up or in the car splitting races even though joeys 18 hes real mature in the sense of this is what i think ive thought a lot about this this is what i want to do so that meant a lot to us and i think were all on the same page here
7664015 personally i dont think its as big a jump as going from the camping world series one of nascars developmental regional touring series to the nationwide series
7664016 i dont think its as bad because youre already racing against a lot of cup guys in nationwide so you kind of know what youre expecting
7664017 ive already done a lot of cup testing when i jumped in the nationwide car i didnt have hardly any laps in the nationwide car but i have a lot of laps in a cup car so i feel more comfortable doing that racing at richmond than i did at dover ive done lord knows how many test sessions but its a lot and its done nothing but help me

7664028 the nice part about technology as with most things is that mature platforms fragment
7664029 so we have these youth optimized devices that we really have never seen just a few years ago
7664030 whats nice about it is that it appeals to a demographic that doesnt have a whole lot of money in their pocket
7664031 these kids dont have 200 or 300 dollars to spend on a phone although theyd like to the blitz is cool enough that you dont have to be branded as the person using the cheap phone in school
7664032 the blitz looks like a nice addition to the lineup and really optimized in a way that this demographic uses their devices where messaging and music is as important as phone calls
7664033 when i first won the title with manchester united i think norwich were the team we had to beat to it
7664034 that will never happen again now i dont think youll ever have a smaller team mounting a challenge
7664035 but the gap here now is enormous its huge outside the top four it will become more and more difficult
7664036 they just add two pieces a year dont they i know manchester united havent really bought this year but last season they bought four and spent 70million after winning the league
7664037 how do you compete with that what you do is try and compete and hope you catch them on an off day
7664038 the top teams only lose two or three a season thats what the premier league is about but i think there are three divisions in it now it is very difficult to compete
7664039 it was disappointing for adam because he was running the midfield
7664040 it is a big priority we have played two league games and we have taken three points
7664041 we have got a massive game at home against west brom on the saturday after and then fulham the saturday after that away from home
7664042 but the priority now becomes beating northampton at home we want to do as well as we possibly can in that cup
7664043 i want to pick the strongest team i can to get through in that competition
7664044 what was happening to us last year was purely as a reaction to what our league form was doing but we are not in that position just at the moment and hopefully wont be
7664045 there may be one or two forced on us because of a couple of knocks that we got on saturday
7664046 but i would like to be in a position where we can give it everything we have possibly got to win the competitions that we are entering
7664047 last year we had issues purely and simply because of our league position and that had to be where we prioritised
7664048 but we will be putting out a strong team against northampton because we want to go through
7664049 we would like to bring somebody in we would like to bring a minimum of two people into the football club if we can
7664050 we are not a champions league team we have got some champions league qualities about us in terms of effort and desire and all that
7664051 but what we have got to try to do is bring in two players who we can put into that first team to make us better and not just two bodies
7664052 i am very happy because we got an agreement with the people from the club
7664053 i was also trying to push it so we could get the deal done because people were talking too much about situations which werent really there
7664054 so i think that starting this week we can have an easy week now in training and just concentrate on each game
7664055 i also think that the people at the club can now relax they are making jokes already
7664056 it is going to be very positive to the mentality of the team and that is why it is important
7664057 i think it is great news for the fans but also for the players the gaffer and for me it wasnt a good thing to get phone calls every day asking me what is happening
7664058 so for me it is very important that it is all done and now i can just focus now on blackburn and football im 100 a blackburn player and i will keep working hard
7664059 im very happy with the reaction from the fans they keep pushing me to get better and better beside the result against hull it has been a wonderful week
7664060 its been unsettling for everyone including roque himself and were absolutely delighted at the club and the players are as well because he is a talisman for us
7664061 i have never experienced a situation like this being two months without kicking a ball i just want to be fully recovered
7664062 i am not used to being sidelined i feel sad but the worst moment has already gone and i recognise that i must patient
7664063 i feel well and the time of kicking a ball is coming playing football this is what makes me happy
7664064 i think that i had very positive campaign last season it would be a dream that becomes reality to win it not any player has done what i did last season
7664065 maybe we cannot win the premier league but we can win the carling cup
7664066 we have done it before and we will be looking for a decent run in the competition
7664067 it is a competition that we can genuinely win we have to believe that
7664068 it is a tournament we can go a long way in and we have done that in the past
7664069 we need a good run in the carling cup so much about cups is in the lap of the gods but we have to maintain the form that we have shown already
7664070 i do not believe they will need too much raising of spirits ahead of yeovil considering how well we played at liverpool
7664071 we lost but did not deserve to and we can take much of the spirit and performance levels we showed at anfield into our next match
7664072 we will make sure that we recover properly and be ready to go again
7664073 it is going to be something of a contrast going from anfield to the game against yeovil but we must not forget that it is a competition we believe we can win
7664074 the key to the will be our own attitude if we get that right then we can win the game our approach must be right
7664075 i do not need to rest anybody but i do need to make sure that the players who have not been playing up to now get the chance to improve their match fitness
7664076 there will be changes we already know we will be without brad jones because of the injury he got prior to the start at liverpool
7664077 but ross turnbull would have played anyway in the carling cup regardless of any injuries so he will be in the side again

7664093 now ive just got to make sure i am fit and healthy for the next few games
7664094 we will discuss how long im going to play against coventry but obviously oba martins has now got an injury and we will just have to wait and see
7664095 i had a bad illness over the summer but i could have been really unlucky and had it during the season thankfully ive just missed one game though it seems like i have been away for ages
7664096 your game changes over the years when i started i suppose i scored one in 50 headers and now every other goal seems to be from my head
7664097 its going to be a tough place to go but it should be a good game
7664098 coventry have started off well i know they were beaten on saturday but they started off with six points from the first two games and they have got a guy who i really respect in charge there chris coleman who i brought to fulham
7664099 they are a club that are looking to build and go places and their ambition is to be in the league we are in
7664100 it is a good test for us in a competition we will take very seriously
7664101 it is one of two chances if we are honest we can win the fa cup and we can win the carling cup they are definitely the two chances

7664127 im aware stoke city and me as a manager have poor records in this competition over recent years its time we did something about it and we will put out a decent team at cheltenham
7664128 it wont be easy i watched cheltenham at their place twice last season and its a tight ground and a good atmosphere they will be out to claim our scalp and whoever we put out will have to be up for it
7664129 well mix and match it weve got a lot of players who are short of time on the pitch and this is an opportunity to put that right
7664130 one win doesnt alter the fact we still need to improve the squad weve got a lot of irons in the fire and i will be very disappointed if we dont bring in another two or three this week

7664133 caesar told me at the beginning of his outstanding tenure here that for years he had considered making a career change and there could come a time when he would decide to do something else besides editing
7664134 caesar has his own thoughts that he will share with you heres one more from me
7664135 we could have had no better editor partner colleague and friend than caesar these last three years through much change many challenges and much incredible journalism we all know that and i feel personally and deeply indebted to him
7664136 by the time i depart in early november i intend to have expressed my personal gratitude to the many people who made my three years in detroit as fulfilling as just about any stage in my career
7664137 more than once i have marveled at my good fortune to work at a place as legendary as the free press the talent on this staff is outstanding so is the journalism some of it among the best ive ever witnessed
7664138 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world

7664148 it is what it is its fine no crazy dramas going on
7664149 its not a mom and dad who are home eating bon bons its a couple whos fucking well clear the kitchen so fast you dont know what to do with yourself
7664150 my kids are by no means ready to watch this 90210
7664151 im really sad that it hasnt happened yet and im very hopeful that it will happen
7664152 i just dont see john mccain deviating from george w bush
7664153 biden has been so critical in the past of obama not of him personally but of his foreign policy background and experience i certainly think thats going to be an issue i think senator bidens words during the primary will be looked at very closely and carefully now that he is barack obamas vp candidate
7664154 will turn a minority into a majority when democrats capture the statehouse
7664155 id also point out there may be a few people in this room that are like me whose original candidate wasnt barack obama
7664156 i had a very loyal commitment to the woman whose husband appointed me ambassador to india but as soon as the primary was over i matched my contribution to her with my contribution to barack obama and i expect to double it before the election
7664157 oftentimes people will say what is it that you do
7664158 i am very clear i am an advocate for the people i am very clear that i believe in strong leadership i am very clear that we will have senator barack obama as our next president i am very clear that with the best governor that you can have in the united states governor ted strickland we will make a difference for the middle class we will make a difference for working people we will make a difference that every child and every family will have health insurance we will make the difference that little children going to public schools will grow up and be proud like any of us in this room who graduated from a public school and went on to public universities and or private universities and or historically black colleges to make a difference thats what i stand for thats why i do what i do
7664159 and to give you that wonderful duck run smile my governor the honorable ted strickland
7664160 i think it is an example of what can be done when people put aside their own narrow interests and focus on the common good
7664161 the common good is our obligation as people who believe in democratic principles and believe in the democratic party
7664162 there is the recognition that ohio is the key to the presidency
7664163 so were going to do what has to be done to make sure that barack obama is our new president and joe biden is our new vice president that we get two to four new democrats in the u s house of representatives that we have enough seats in the senate to deprive the republicans of a veto majority
7664164 were going to craft a budget that is reflective of the tough times but that is committed to the things that most matter
7664165 biden has been so critical in the past of obama not of him personally but of his foreign policy background and experience i certainly think thats going to be an issue i think senator bidens words during the primary will be looked at very closely and carefully now that he is barack obamas vp candidate
7664166 i have a booger in my nose im going to pick it lovely
7664167 but he said he was too young for the role
7664168 pageant will start next month nuns from around the world will be able to submit a picture of themselves along with a short bio it will be their choice to pose with a veil or not but can they post with

7664170 britney spears will not be performing at the vmas this year im telling you officially and unequivocally

7664177 people of the world this is our moment this is our time
7664178 reports are that she approached the ips iraqi police saying she had the vest on and didnt want to go through with it
7664179 if she was forced to put on the vest or if she did it voluntarily that is still being reviewed
7664180 we should not separate in speech they sergius and bacchus who were joined in life
7664181 erastai or lovers in other words they were a male homosexual couple their orientation and relationship was not only acknowledged but it was fully accepted and celebrated by early christian church historians
7664182 vouchsafe unto these thy servants n and n the grace to love one another and to abide without hate and not be the cause of scandal all the days of their lives with the help of the holy mother of god and all thy saints
7664183 and they shall kiss the holy gospel and each other and it shall be concluded
7664184 taking communion together using the same nuptial scripture after which they slept and ate together
7664185 you could be holy like me if you werent queer but you are so burn in hell
7664186 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him 16 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world 17 and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever
7664187 now faith is being sure of what we hope for
7664188 6 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me 7 if ye had known me ye should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him
7664189 15 he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am 16 and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god
7664190 3 for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith
7664191 25 now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began 26 but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting god made known to all nations for the obedience of faith
7664192 36 but i have greater witness than that of john for the works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me
7664193 37 if i do not the works of my father believe me not 38 but if i do though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him
7664194 17 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god a faith trust and conviction is founded upon what the word of god reveals b this is especially true regarding faith in jesus again and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book 31 but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name
7664195 7 jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
7664196 11 then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him
7664197 4 for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith 5 who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god
7664198 37 and philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest and he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god
7664199 6 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me 7 if ye had known me ye should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him
7664200 17 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god
7664201 30 and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book 31 but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name
7664202 1 behold the lords hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear 2 but your iniquities have separated between you and your god and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear
7664203 23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
7664204 8 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
7664205 30 and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commandeth all men every where to repent 31 because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead
7664206 12 for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the lord is against them that do evil
7664207 19 i create the fruit of the lips peace peace to him that is far off and to him that is near saith the lord and i will heal him 20 but the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest whose waters cast up mire and dirt 21 there is no peace saith my god to the wicked
7664208 31 then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed 32 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free 33 they answered him we be abrahams seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free 34 jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin
7664209 14 for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin
7664210 20 now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
7664211 how to perform what is good i do not find
7664212 into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members
7664213 24 o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death
7664214 9 in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him 10 herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins
7664215 9 much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him
7664216 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
7664217 19 repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord
7664218 3 know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death 4 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life 5 for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection 6 knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin 7 for he that is dead is freed from sin
7664219 9 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
7664220 6 knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin 7 for he that is dead is freed from sin
7664221 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit 2 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death
7664222 the law principle of the spirit of life in christ
7664223 16 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man
7664224 20 now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us 21 unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end amen
7664225 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost 39 for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call
7664226 26 for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus 27 for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ
7664227 6 and because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father

7664232 there is spontaneous and complete disclosure and the taxpayer has no reason to fear early discovery
7664233 an offence which involves only a minor degree of negligence associated with muddle or confusion might subject to size and circumstances rate as much as 35 percent
7664234 there will be cases where the circumstances are such that little in the way of telling helping and access is needed to establish the reasons for the person giving an inaccurate document and the amount of any additional tax due you should allow the full reduction for those elements of disclosure that are not required
7664235 the person needs to show a positive approach to telling what has happened not just reacting to questions
7664236 actively engaging in the work to accurately quantify the inaccuracies
7664237 you should only seek access to records that are reasonably required for the purpose of ensuring that the document is corrected

7664257 se debe revisar la permanencia del prd en el fap en virtud de que esa instancia se est usando para favorecer a candidatos contrarios al prd el caso de acapulco es el m s grave hasta el momento pero no es el nico ser a importante que andr s manuel l pez obrador se deslinde de esas pr cticas desleales contra su partido para desmentir las insidias del coordinador impuesto del fap en el sentido de que l apoya esa estrategia perversa si no se rectifica dicha pol tica que ha sido cobijada por el pt y por convergencia el prd debe salirse del fap

7664303 unfortunately in an environment in which medical costs continue to rise and managed care and corporate executives scrutinize expenses and minimize discretionary investments we think healthways high priced services stand to lose ground
7664304 should management opt to reduce prices to compete more effectively it will likely be at the expense of margins and earnings
7664305 the management team is unwilling to adjust to a rapid moving environment
7664306 the good products it had that were good six months ago are not necessarily good for right now
7664307 we recognize the significant challenges our existing and potential customers face in this uncertain economic environment and with increasing costs of health care

7664334 it is surprising that people like haywood and stanislaus manage to procure business visas from our missions abroad and indulge in employment or religious activities in india we have informed the intelligence bureau

7664346 it is known that nearly 70 of tybms students attempt the cat to enter into the indian institute of management iims the exam is always held on the third sunday of november but thanks to the universitys poor planning bms students do not have time to prepare for their cat
7664347 this hardly gives us time to prepare for the most important entrance exam moreover this is not the first time the university has been conducting exams simultaneously with cat
7664348 since the university doesnt give us time to prepare for cat we have no option but to waste a year and appear for it after finishing graduation several students in my class havent even bothered to fill up the cat forms
7664349 the university never schedules the tybcom and ca exams together then why are bms students treated inconsiderately the ideal time for the exams would be the first week of november
7664350 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 advantage last month
7664351 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7664352 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time

7664360 displays almost every trope of blackness single parent household born poor working class saxophone playing boy from arkansas
7664361 i was deploring the way in which president clinton was being treated vis vis the sex scandal that was surrounding him i said he was being treated like a black on the street already guilty already a perp i have no idea what his real instincts are in terms of race
7664362 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7664363 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7664364 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7664365 neither one of them can win but both of them can make the other lose
7664366 i just dont see how theres going to be any stand down by either one of them thats going to turn the campaign in another direction
7664367 when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember
7664368 now hes a convicted felon facing jail thats a housing problem
7664369 were not going to shy away from making the contrast people are making a choice we need to make clear what that choice is
7664370 were going to do it in a constructive way but were going to lay it out very very clearly
7664371 after working in the clinton administration in the department of commerce on internet privacy and online commerce issues hunter consulted for five years as an expert on these very same issues at a time of enormous expansion in online banking
7664372 he was not a lobbyist for mbna and his work had absolutely nothing to do with the bankruptcy bill zero nothing
7664373 took plenty of knocks from the largest employer in his state because he demanded changes
7664374 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill
7664375 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums
7664376 it wouldnt make sense for me to want to edit his remarks
7664377 during the course of a 19 month campaign i think that youre on the television screen youre in big auditoriums but sometimes who you are may get lost
7664378 the fact is we had a very hard fought primary there are going to be some of senator clintons supporters we have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
7664379 the clintons love this country they love the democratic party and they are going to be active participants in our campaign for the remaining 70 days
7664380 not that he should have known the rules he did know
7664381 a unique technology that has not been applied successfully to an airplane
7664382 when the numbers were high i would get stopped in the street maybe once a week
7664383 now that the viewing figures are lower on the tv everywhere i go someone will come up to me and say what a huge fan they are that just tells me that people watch the show in a more modern way and that it has reached its sort of critical mass
7664384 tivo had just sort of taken off this was four or five seasons ago and because we were on friday nights most people most fans dont watch it on first run they tivo it and watch it a zillion times
7664385 in fact i dont think we ever go into space
7664386 its really about big business the machinations and the subterfuge that go on inside of it when you have something that is groundbreaking and could change the nature of life and the future
7664387 its about a vibrant society its really at the height of its power and the height of its decadence at the same time
7664388 so its really a thriving vibrant culture thats going to come apart as we watch but its sort of the roller coaster its thrilling at the top when you see how far down youve got to go

7664396 its really its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7664397 its very difficult to refocus and just to get ready for the open yesterday i was trying to go to sleep but i couldnt because i was watching the closing ceremony and my mind is still there
7664398 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you what is this but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger there is nothing more important than olympic games for an athlete for a sportsperson
7664399 we played six matches in a row in beijing and the best players in the world were competing there it was big challenge for me and gives me a lot of confidence for sure after this big win people just come to me and say oh im happy for you youre always losing in the final its so great that you finally win something big

7664414 this is the most important day of the year for me of course with the kids coming back happy new year to you all
7664415 we made progress last year and its so important that we build on that progress and that we continue to accelerate
7664416 this school has been a godsend in regards to the overcrowded conditions we experienced the last two years
7664417 the teachers are just as nervous as the kids are and we have just as much trouble picking out what we were going to wear and packing our bags to make sure we were ready for the day
7664418 it has laptops and im going to be excited to use some of these
7664419 he sought to counsel and calm the despairing to transform the grief that contemplates the grave by showing it the grief that looks up to the stars
7664420 slipped beneath the waters tranquil surface and others rushed to help
7664421 there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain
7664422 give thanks in all circumstances for this is gods will for us in christ jesus 1th
7664423 by prayer and petition with thanksgiving we present our requests to god
7664424 pray in the spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests
7664425 he did not seek to drown grief in oblivion but to exalt and dignify it through hope a dry eye goes with a dead soul
7664426 you need to be content before god will bless you
7664427 some of those have to be revisited and possibly reinstituted in a new fashion because students still need support

7664430 we can go on all day long about how much money has to be raised how to segment the vote who votes at what times of the day under what weather conditions
7664431 but what everyone else wants to hear is what difference does it make
7664432 i believe that what people are hungry for is visionary positive leadership
7664433 not that answer to every problem in everybodys life but an ability to articulate a destination
7664434 in our campaign in the commonwealth and in presumptive democratic nominee barack obamas campaign nationally what he has done is invite people that have checked out to check back in and to see their state again in their own civic and professional lives
7664435 there is a whole lot of the electorate many of them young
7664436 that just dont get counted in how we think about and analyze politics
7664437 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7664438 we just want to put out weird cool shit without thinking about making money
7664439 i think what weve had here is a little social concern in the nfl
7664440 there is a little hope invested in mcnabb and he got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he didnt deserve the defense carried this team
7664441 this agreement makes the sec the most widely distributed conference in the country
7664442 the bottom line here is that fans of sec football will have more access to games and better distribution than they ever have in the past
7664443 its not hard to figure why wed want to be involved with it given the quality of sec sports for 15 more years
7664444 one of the reasons that this league has developed into one of the top leagues in the country is because we have tremendous exposure
7664445 i think we had the best exposure from a tv standpoint in our last contract and this one is only going to enhance it more
7664446 we need to keep pressure on iran so israel doesnt attack them
7664447 polling places in shelby county will be open today from 7 a m to 7 p m for state and federal primaries and county general elections
7664448 also voters will decide the fate of two sets of amendments to the shelby county charter and will vote yes or no to retain seven state appeals court judges the county general election ballot features races for assessor trustee general sessions court clerk and criminal court judge division 6
7664449 barack obama never defended congressman stephen cohen from the black racists and anti semites of memphis
7664450 davis said that a tennessee law exists which states that if a person consistently votes in one partys primary elections and then switches to another partys primary that vote can be challenged
7664451 davis added that he is aware of anecdotal evidence that democrats switched over in several counties in thursdays election
7664452 brook thompson state coordinator of elections stated the process is to challenge them at the polls on election day
7664453 an election day challenge would involve poll watchers who based on their own knowledge could challenge someone who has always voted in one partys primary when that person suddenly seeks to vote in the other partys primary
7664454 the state coordinator said the law allows for challenges on election day but not afterward adding i dont know of any election that has been challenged after the fact based on that law
7664455 the ruling requires the state to provide language assistance including trained poll workers who are bilingual in english and yupik sample ballots will have to be written in yupik a glossary of election terms also written in yupik will have to be provided
7664456 by the way i noticed how you motivated the workers so well they finished the project well ahead of time i want you to come work for me
7664457 youre too strict too cutting and i have pressures you know so i am sending you to that distant far away town where nobody important works

7664465 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
7664466 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7664467 im supposed to visit you someday but itll be several more years just hold tight okay
7664468 hey do you think i could borrow a robe or something you keep it like an icebox in here
7664469 look not to beat around the bush or anything but who
7664470 i thought you guys were a braintrust you can figure out sisyphus and tantalus but you cant place your old pal eros
7664471 geez adam dont you ever read these things when youre illustrating them
7664472 really man this is the sort of cheery valentines day stereotype thats been plaguing me for years now
7664473 thats cupid or at least the crappy hallmark ized version you doofy mortals have conjured up that was the name the romans gave me i still prefer the greeks name eros doesnt it just sound more regal
7664474 besides it kind of sounds like arrows which i always thought was kind of funny
7664475 flies around shoots people with arrows makes em fall in love
7664476 you my friend were a hell of a project you fell for a girl at the drop of a hat but finding a match geez i never realized the trouble it would cause
7664477 you made me fall in love with stephanie why the hell would you do such a stupid destructive thing
7664478 whoa whoa adam its not that simple ive seen all the cartoons i know how you mortals
7664479 what i do is i find people who have a genuine connection people who actually belong together then i help them realize it i tell you adam no one was more surprised than i was when i realized i could connect a dumpy little web cartoonist like yourself with the queen of the underworld but a match is a match
7664480 none of the stuff you read in the books describes your power that way
7664481 thats because its a lot more romantic to say eros makes people fall in love than it is to say eros helps compatible individuals form a meaningful connection the guys who wrote the history books were still writers perry they werent above a little use of creative license
7664482 a stone cold bitch no actually that part was true when it was written anyway
7664483 shes mellowed three thousand years trapped underground in a loveless marriage with a husband whos lost all the sesame seeds off his hamburger bun will kill the spark from most women in my experience
7664484 its bad down there guys im not going to lie to you most of hades realm was never a picnic but after new spirits stopped flowing in hades started to get bored and when he got bored he got
7664485 from what i know of the guy he wouldnt approve either
7664486 so hades has spent a few thousand years torturing dead people
7664487 no just the first few hundred then he started to get bored again
7664488 why do i get the feeling i wont like this part
7664489 he started to expand first he aimed for the elysian fields but the heroes who rest there managed to band together and keep out the army of the unclaimed so then he decided to go into the seas he started in a spot you mortals call the bermuda triangle sinking ships from right underneath the ocean floor people started to get paranoid about the place then he took the battle back to greece and he tried to scale olympus itself the war was intense it spilled out all over the earth it lasted for hundreds of years and a lot of our smaller battles are in your history books you see hades zeus and poseidon used mortal proxies to fight their own battles the crusades the war of 1812 world war ii
7664490 poseidon took control of your air forces to try to blast hades off the map he succeeded but he had to ride the bomb down he lets just say that we were all surprised to find out the humans had invented something powerful enough to kill a god poseidon especially i suppose
7664491 no kidding anyway after that zeus and hades signed a treaty zeus wouldnt interfere in the underworld and hades wouldnt interfere in the sky trouble is earth itself is still free territory
7664492 things have been quiet for about 60 years or so but the last few years hades has been moving again persephone kept making her visits to earth all this time he didnt really care until you adam
7664493 damned if i know all i know is that youre only the second person to touch persephones heart since the day hades first snatched her by her ponytail and dragged her underground i dont think anyone really believed it either i mean shes had lovers before adam dont wince i know youve been reading the books and everyone sort of assumed you were just another toy but then this year when she got out she made a beeline right back here looking for you
7664494 good grief cant you just hear his ego inflating from here
7664495 the lines are being drawn zeus is staying out of it but the rest of us arent powerful enough to fight hades alone so weve been trying to band together apollo and athena have been leading the rest of us ares and hephaestus have both thrown in with hades a lot of the other lesser gods have joined one side or another we think persephone can be our ace in the hole with her working with us we may be able to get in and destroy hades before this war of his finally destroys the world and frankly if we cant stop him i think itll be sooner rather than later
7664496 so why are you here were three mere mortals what can we do
7664497 i see those care commercials on television with the starving children with the big bellies and these are 1 and 2 year old babies nine months pregnant
7664498 it breaks my heart i dont give them money though because i dont want them to spend it on drugs but i give last year i sent a whole box of dvds they sent me a letter thanking me they said thank you and that there were enough dvds for every member of the village to get one and that they were delicious

7664508 the confusion arose out of regional differences in how moderation will work as there are different legal rules each region have to play by and at one point this looked like it may require the game to be independent in each region
7664509 first and foremost meulen told me without hesitation that it is a 100 percent guarantee that home will be released by the end of this calendar year he has absolutely no doubt that this will be the case so it looks like the long wait to come home is finally reaching its conclusion meulen also assured me quite adamantly that home will always be a free service only premium content will need to be purchased i know some gamers were concerned that once home reached a certain user base a fee might be applied to the service but this is not the case meulen says that there are no plans to charge for home even in the far future

7664530 who challenged a virginia law against posting social security numbers on the internet won a partial victory friday when a federal judge ruled her internet postings are protected by the constitution
7664531 it is difficult to imagine a more archetypal instance of the press informing the public of government operations through government records than ostergrens posting of public records to demonstrate the lack of care being taken by the government to protect the private information of individuals
7664532 in the end it appears this law was passed not for the purpose of protecting social security numbers but to silence a critic of the states failure to protect such numbers from identity thieves

7664572 living and dying in a long term care facility notes from a nursing home doctor
7664573 when is a choice truly a choice and when is it not
7664574 when i agreed to have a cesarean was i really making a choice
7664575 first of all i the chooser was not truly informed second my doctor lied to me
7664576 until the evidence demonstrates that medically elective cesarean delivery optimizes outcomes for mothers and their infants perinatal nurses must advocate for vaginal delivery as the optimal mode of birth
7664577 i had a heavy crash in practice then we had a wet session and qualifying didnt go according to plan and i was fourth and a second row start
7664578 my bike worked like a dream and to get the first double win of the year for the team is great and i think it might be the first time that they have taken the double here at their local circuit
7664579 we had a bit of bad luck at the start of this year and i did lack a bit of confidence but the team have worked hard and the bike has increased ten fold now and we are back to winning ways
7664580 we have struggled a bit here but if struggling is two third places then thats not bad at all we are still leading the championship and thats all that matters
7664581 in the first race i was passed and then lost a few tenths when the front wheel slid at the hairpin
7664582 its a good double rostrum for rizla suzuki although i would have liked to have won a race to say thank you to the team for all its efforts second in the title race is what we want and from here on in ill be getting my finger out to bring home more silverware we all want more race wins
7664583 in race two i enjoyed a fight with karl harris and michael laverty my rizla suzuki is performing very well and the engine braking and throttle response gives me much confidence passing michael was difficult as his suzuki has similar speed but i really wanted a good result
7664584 cadwell park is track i like although the mountain is still scary i feel that my rizla suzuki is better than ever and i am now looking forward to the rest of the season i cannot wait for croft
7664585 a pair of second places is a good result for tom and the rizla suzuki squad well done to them all we harboured hopes for wins but cadwell park is a tough place to make overtakes but we have all enjoyed fighting at the front for the top honours
7664586 atsu has proved a point this round by conquering the hardest circuit on the bsb calendar and taking his best result so far and quite a few good scalps in the process
7664587 its off to world championship duty for tom and rizla suzuki in a fortnight and we want to be challenging for the podium if possible the gsx r1000 is right on the money and so is tom the fans really helped us at brands earlier in the month and i hope theyll come and show their support again at donington
7664588 to be back in amongst the front runners feels great and i am really happy i was hoping to get onto the podium especially in the second race but the fact that im riding better and the airwaves ducati 1098r set up has improved is a result in itself i managed to knock four tenths of a second off my time and actually posted the fastest time in the final sector which includes the mountain so im feeling confident now heading to croft
7664589 i really like cadwell park and i thought it would be a good circuit for us on the airwaves ducati but its actually been a tough weekend weve had to work so much harder and make a lot of changes from session to session but all credit to the airwaves ducati team for helping me get two podiums today i really want to get back on that top step and i think that had the second race been the original 18 laps i could have won nevertheless im looking forward to croft and hopefully taking the momentum and the pace from race two with us

7664594 there was a very good discussion a lot of points put on the table which the ministers took on board and i guess that will formulate the basis of further discussion to caucus

7664596 if they the opposition decide to be spoilers then we will seek to negotiate with the minor parties to make sure these essential budget bills are carried

7664601 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7664602 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7664603 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7664604 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7664605 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7664606 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7664607 im looking to purchase a tom bihn bag for my son who is starting high school this fall
7664608 i wish i had a brain bag in high school i have one now it so well balanced has such adequate cushion on the back and straps and it is a very sturdy item it is the greatest backpack i ever owned
7664609 my two daughters have a smart alec with two years of use and still perfect
7664610 my sons brain bag and its accessories came just in the nick of time the day before school started
7664611 everything you say is looked at and in many cases misconstrued
7664612 theres a reason why people like her its because she doesnt sort of you know fuel the fire

7664617 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7664618 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7664619 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner

7664624 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7664625 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
7664626 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
7664627 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

7664636 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
7664637 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
7664638 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
7664639 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law

7664659 i am very certain that people at fifa and the confederation of african football caf are understanding enough not to sanction such a match
7664660 if anything we will still be mourning our president since the period has now been extended to 21 days
7664661 its our prayer as government that our request will be heard
7664662 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
7664663 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discreet charm
7664664 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case anymore
7664665 if you dont know how to behave in public then stay in your room until you figure it out jackass
7664666 people need to understand that when im on the phone it is important
7664667 capital punishment is our societys recognition of the sanctity of human life
7664668 unique among the nations america recognized the source of our character as being godly and eternal not being civic and temporal and because we have understood that our source is eternal america has been different we have no king but jesus
7664669 were going to bring back god and the bible and drive the gods of secular humanism right out of the public schools of america
7664670 therefore i am convinced that i am acting as the agent of our creator by fighting off the jews i am doing the lords work

7664674 i have been able to pack my size 48 blazer in the aeronaut without too much trouble i put the blazer on a light weight hanger in a standard garment bag after i have my packing cubes ready i lay the garment bag on the open areonaut and tuck the bottom of the bag into the main compartment with the top half of the bag draped over the back i pack the cubes on top of this and then tuck the top of the garment bag over the cubes this makes a loose bundle with the garment bag around the packing cubes i have done this with just a wool blazer and with a full poly cotton suit with minimal wrinkles

7664677 this is an incredibly attractive financing opportunity since loans are repaid through the cost savings once energy efficiency investments have been put into place
7664678 the 400th location marks our entry into the big leagues
7664679 the cost of entry to play with the larger chains includes proficiencies in areas like real estate marketing operational support and research and development in the past year we have made great strides in all of these areas leaving us right where we need to be to continue steady strategic growth
7664680 a pattern of misleading and questionable practices has emerged from our investigation into home loans
7664681 these unfair lending practices may have harmed thousands of people and in turn negatively affected our communities and neighborhoods throughout the state
7664682 we thought it was time to take advantage of this momentum
7664683 used to justify the belated length of stay and the battery of medical testing
7664684 in order to increase revenues and thus profitability saint josephs engaged in a widespread and systematic scheme to admit to inpatient status patients who did not otherwise meet inpatient admission criteria and then issue charges and bills for such inpatient services accordingly
7664685 this scheme was well known to saint josephs management administration staff and contractors if not also its board of directors moreover saint josephs management and administration actively concealed such practices
7664686 as with the first it is factually inaccurate and wholly without merit we will vigorously contest it
7664687 the song is simple its just me trying to pick up a girl at a club and convince her to come have some fun with me the video definitely has that story line in it but we just take it kind of different places to do some unexpected visual things we have this surreal kind of dance sequence and it features synchronized swimmers and showgirls we just throw a little extra twist on it we wanted to mix a current modern feel with an old school classic hollywood feel because the song has kind of a big band quality to it as well as a more modern dance song quality we wanted to mix the two different parts
7664688 the turks will never invade the russians will stop them
7664689 does god really care if we gained ten pounds over the holidays yes
7664690 if youve struggled with obesity all of your life you may not even be able to imagine yourself free of the bondage of unwanted fat but god can
7664691 we have worshiped food and elevated it to a place of unprecedented power in our lives our hearts have been devoted to figuring out what the latest fad diet will or will not let us eat
7664692 behind poor health behaviors we often find social injustice and inadequate social services and insufficient economic opportunities school and church lunches and refreshments may feature food with low nutritional value and contribute further to the problems with diet and obesity in our state the well known association of poverty health and education does not spring from the spirit of our people but from a culture for which we are all responsible
7664693 it would be terrific if a program like this got off the ground
7664694 theres a danger of narcissism in these other groups why is the concern always about me and my body and my self discipline rather than saying that other people in the developing world or in rural parts of our own country are in dire straits and need help learning about food and need help affording healthy food to eat a balanced diet
7664695 this is a targeted enforcement operation that is part of an ongoing ice investigation that has revealed that illegal aliens are employed at howard industries
7664696 the constituency consists of 69 percent malay 25 percent chinese and the remainder being indian if you look at the malay vote if he manages to woo them if he manages to pull 70 strong to 80 percent many people in umno would jump because they would see that he controls the malay support
7664697 if you jump sooner then you can hope to get a position in his new government you jump later he may not even pick you
7664698 the umno machinery has been playing up ethnic sentiments to its height they openly compare chinese as pigs
7664699 you never do that publicly never put that in a campaign and this time around umno used that in a malay area hoping that would push up the malay support to create that sense that if you have anwar winning the chinese and the indians are going to dominate the country
7664700 well i dont believe that climate change is just an issue thats convenient to bring up during a campaign i believe its one of the greatest moral challenges of our generation thats why ive fought successfully in the senate to increase our investment in renewable fuels thats why i reached across the aisle to come up with a plan to raise our fuel standards and i didnt just give a speech about it in front of some environmental audience in california i went to detroit i stood in front of a group of automakers and i told them that when i am president there will be no more excuses we will help them retool their factories but they will have to make cars that use less oil
7664701 i notice that we are starting to exclude the name of our school
7664702 i thought michael moores documentary sicko was very good and informational
7664703 it is kinda funny how humiliating stories have a way of turning out to be fond ones my kids love this story i was in a spelling bee up on the stage in the audutorium i had to go to the bathroom really bad but i didnt think i could say anything in fear of the nuns i ended up peeing right there where i was standing on the stage i remember one of the nuns moving me away from a electrical socket that was in the floor she probably thought id electrocute myself im pretty sure i was praying for it again maybe not the story you were looking for but it definitely has been one of the most told through the years can you beat it
7664704 the single biggest factor in usb drive performance is whether it contains one of two types of memory slc single level cell or mlc multilevel cell slc stores one bit in each memory cell and mlc stores two bits in each cell

7664709 the mind controlled by the spirit is life and peace
7664710 the specific type and source of tomatoes is under investigation
7664711 the biological mechanism for how these disinfection by products may cause defects are still unknown
7664712 however our findings dont just add to the evidence that water chlorination may cause birth defects but suggest that exposure to chlorination by products may be responsible for some specific and common defects
7664713 while the benefits of water chlorination are quite evident more research needs to be carried out to determine these side effects
7664714 little evidence between thm concentrations in drinking water and risk of congenital defects and consequently tap water is safe for expectant mothers
7664715 hexagonal water comprised of small molecular units or ring shaped clusters moves easily within the cellular matrix of the body helping with nutrient absorption and waste removal it aids metabolic processes supports the immune system contributes to lasting vitality and acts as a carrier of dissolved oxygen it can provide alkaline minerals to the body and it helps in the more efficient removal of acidic wastes it supports long life and freedom from disease
7664716 regrettably in many cases the emphasis has changed from the desire to provide a needy child with a home to that of providing a needy parent with a child as a result a whole industry has grown generating millions of dollars of revenue each year
7664717 those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities
7664718 anyone who knows anything of history knows that great social changes are impossible without feminine upheaval social progress can be measured exactly by the social position of the fair sex the ugly ones included
7664719 the individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe
7664720 youre born alone you die alone the rest is yours to fill the gap the world goes on without you here adjust or just collapse
7664721 we incorporated his injury into it not because it was absolutely necessary but director michael bay in particular wanted to be able to protect him on the set
7664722 hes still going to be running around in this movie
7664723 bay literally just wanted for labeoufs safety to make sure that we werent playing around with his injury thats why we put it in
7664724 the stuff where it would be dangerous has not been scheduled yet and that stuff its important to put the injury in there

7664755 most golfers playing with the current grooves or new grooves wont notice any difference
7664756 they dont hit greens out of the rough very often anyway but i can tell you for a fact that golfers who use surlyn hard covered balls will not notice any difference in spin keep in mind that two thirds of the balls sold today are surlyn balls
7664757 there are a lot of questions that need to be answered we dont really know exactly how all golfers will be affected or how much they will be able to spin the ball we need to take our time in evaluating this
7664758 and they knew the difference right from the very first hit these guys are so sensitive they are amazing we used clubs that looked identical but they knew let me repeat though most average golfers really wont see or feel much of a difference
7664759 in the range of 50 percent on an 8 iron and around 25 percent on a wedge from the rough
7664760 its going to help all the guys who drive it better straighter im looking forward to it well see how those guys crooked drivers can control those jumpers out of the rough the people behind the greens better wear hard hats it will make the guys play better it will make them play a little more course management
7664761 we have published 300 pages of research clearly confirming that shots from the rough will be affected but shots from the fairway will not
7664762 i can see some retailer saying to a customer dont you want five vokey spin milled wedges one for each of the next five years virtually every single amateur can use the current wedges until 2014
7664763 i feel well fall in line with the usga implementation date for amateur golf
7664764 youre probably going to have to start using a softer golf ball
7664765 the data about tour players missing fairways and then scoring better and winning events is highly questionable
7664766 the bombers and gougers are still going to spin it more out of the rough
7664767 if the goal is to increase the penalty for being in the rough this isnt going to do it two to 21 2 inch rough is nothing to a guy who can swing an iron at 90 to 95 mph
7664768 i understand that manufacturers lives would be easier if we werent here but i think they understand that we tried to make the process as accommodating to them as possible

7664985 the debate on when and how to treat early parkinsons disease patients has been ongoing currently treatment would typically be initiated when symptoms have caused disability however providing the medical evidence for a treatment to retard or prevent the progression of pd is a major therapeutic priority and the proud study aims to shed more light into this question pramipexole was considered an optimal candidate for this study due to evidence suggesting possible benefits to pd patients beyond treating the well known core symptoms based on the unique technique used in this study proud may provide a major breakthrough in our understanding of early pd treatment which would offer hope to the ever increasing number of patients diagnosed with parkinsons disease
7664986 previously the prodest study identified that pd related depressive symptoms are common with nearly half of those pd patients receiving anti depressants continuing to experience depressive symptoms these symptoms impact significantly on quality of life both for pd patients and their carers the new european study aims to provide answers on the role pramipexole may play in managing these commonly experienced pd related depressive symptoms that are often under recognised and consequently under treated

7665010 i feel pretty good about my chances especially now that ive got one of the finest statesmen in this country on my ticket joe biden as vice president
7665011 that never made sense to me even if george w bush was telling the truth about weapons of mass destruction in fact particularly if he was telling the truth about weapons of mass destruction why the hell would you bomb a country that could fire back that would be insane bush did real damage to americas reputation around the world

7665013 help me out here madame speaker when does life begin
7665014 barack obama represents the merger of two of the worst aspects of democratic politics 60s radicalism and corrupt chicago machine politics with the addition of slow joe biden to the ticket obama has added to his unsteady candidacy an epic amount of beltway cluelessness and arrogance unsupported by anything except frequent flier miles and delawares love for a chuckle headed fellow with a big smile

7665022 republicans are holding their breath until they turn blue rather than support taxes for education and other critical services irresponsibly the republicans refuse to specify where they would cut billions they hope to hide from the pain their budget proposal imposes on public schools but there are many fair ways to raise revenues to balance the multibillion dollar cuts schools will be forced to absorb california is the richest state in the richest country in the world we should be able to adequately fund our schools parks roads health care for seniors and young people at least fire protection and the rest of vital services of the state

7665103 killed himself as a result of depression which was caused by stress from the superiors insulting remarks and actions
7665104 the superiors actions were intended to defame the officer and led to the excessive accumulation of psychological burdens on him
7665105 it was beyond something that can be called an instruction
7665106 you are not qualified as a petty officer third class
7665107 it is the first court ruling that recognizes the states violation of its obligation of ensuring security for national public servants over their psychological burdens

7665111 while recent years have seen a marked increase in most areas of civil law in the use of alternative dispute resolution most notably mediation the field of public law has been the most resistant to this general trend it is difficult some would say to envisage open negotiation on issues of legality compromises at the expense of rights and freedoms or the submission of the exercise of discretionary powers to a mediation agreement

7665120 the first winners were the russian artistic gymnasts in the group exercises then lightweight boxer aleksei tishchenko brought the 23 rd gold into the kitty besides the golds russian athletes won 21 silvers and 28 bronzes in some things the team was in top form but in others it only proved an also ran we won 72 medals a bit less than our original estimate of at least 80 medals nevertheless we set ourselves high goals and our athletes strived to reach them
7665121 the fierce inter team competition in the unofficial medals standing was dramatic at one time we were only in 16 th place and there were those who believed that we could never make it to third place i can tell you for a long time it wasnt all gold it was only yesterday on the next to the last day of the games that we surged ahead of great britain in the number of medals however it was not merely a matter of cold figures the fact is we have real heroes on our team in particular the number one in fan acclaim was yelena isinbayeva when she competed in the pole vault certainly there was the american swimmer mark phelps but swimming lets be frank is less dramatic than yelena leaping into the sky before 100 000 spectators setting a new worlds record this was absolutely beautiful a breath taking virtuoso performance after this victory all the television networks all over the world chased after yelena buvaisar saitiev 1977 three time olympic wrestling gold medallist the same was true of buvaisar saitiev they chased after him as well after all he became a three time olympic wrestling champion synchronised swimmers anastasia davydova and anastasia yermakova became four time olympic champions in their sport for the first time in the history of the olympiads womens marathon swimming was on the programme and russian larisa ilchenko became the first olympic champion in this competition this olympiad showed where the problems in the russian sport programme are it is obvious that we have to have more depth on our team we have to concentrate more on training we have to build many more sport facilities for russia greatly lags behind the usa and china not to mention the other countries in the top ten in this area

7665123 you have no idea how hard we worked during the election campaign and after we had to take some time off we deserved it
7665124 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled mr sharif said in islamabad
7665125 potentially political masterstroke saying there was every chance that he could defeat mr zardari
7665126 hes finally called zardaris bluff hes nominated someone who is highly regarded and theres every chance now that zardari assuming he maintains his candidacy will be defeated
7665127 the world is losing the war i think at the moment they definitely have the upper hand mr zardari said in his first statement since being nominated for the presidency by the ppp
7665128 it wasnt a liquid market particularly as its the last week of the northern summer
7665129 its difficult to put a story around the price action in the last 12 hours
7665130 we fully expect that both the number of suspected and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be tested
7665131 if they the opposition decide to be spoilers then we will seek to negotiate with the minor parties to make sure these essential budget bills are carried
7665132 i want it to sound like silver i want it to sound like gold i just want to beat mariah
7665133 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7665134 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7665135 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support
7665136 that sends the message to the kremlin that it risks international isolation
7665137 mr cheney is widely viewed by the russian political elite as the toughest hawk on russia in the bush administration
7665138 it hasnt gone unanswered in fact id say its been loudly answered
7665139 i dont think theres any question that russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia
7665140 i think well have the majority of our customer growth coming here for the next several years
7665141 but he is in the situation where he cant hit back which jackie robinson could not do he had to be able to run the bases even though the crowd was jeering the first african american on the field
7665142 he has to keep smiling because no one wants an angry african american man in the white house
7665143 when they have a camera put in their faces they will have an opportunity to put their arm around our guy so that he can run the bases
7665144 hillary clinton will have a pee wee reese moment bill clinton will have a pee wee reese moment pennsylvania gov ed rendell will have a pee wee reese moment
7665145 got to show hes able to hit hes got to show hes capable of running the bases thats whether the rubber meets the road
7665146 what does barack obama have to do to convince clinton supporters that hes capable of being president of the united states
7665147 you want to speak fine you want to speak bill fine you want to be vice president no beyond that what else can i do what do you want me to do
7665148 i think youre going to have a number of people who give you an excuse for not voting for a person
7665149 im not at all suggesting race but im not eliminating race
7665150 he doesnt know where he is at any given moment
7665151 even jesus christ himself might not be able to respond
7665152 we have really missed the boat in this campaign on covering race
7665153 i look at how quick we were to jump on the language of post racial the language of race transcendence thats not possible yet in america
7665154 will be a redefinition of politics in america it will be a redefinition of the democratic party
7665155 provide a new era for america to assert its leadership in the world
7665156 to the extent that he continues to meet with people let them look him in the eye shake hands let them ask him a question answer that question
7665157 thats unprecedented you know theres going to be something on the floor but theyll already have our votes tabulated
7665158 theres not going to be a roll call do they
7665159 google looks as if its on top of the world right now holding an ever increasing lions share of the search market the way it treats its employees writes preston gralla another example google employees such as sergey solyanik have started deserting the company and its share price is down double that of the dow or nasdaq since november 2007 even if google has lost its mojo why should you care it wont make your searches any less effective will it nope but google has its eyes on bigger things than search notably your it department its looking to displace microsoft with hosted services like google apps gmail and google docs solyanik warns that googles engineers care more about the coolness of a service than about the services effectiveness

7665164 this agreement makes the sec the most widely distributed conference in the country
7665165 the bottom line here is that fans of sec football will have more access to games and better distribution than they ever have in the past
7665166 its not hard to figure why wed want to be involved with it given the quality of sec sports for 15 more years
7665167 one of the reasons that this league has developed into one of the top leagues in the country is because we have tremendous exposure
7665168 i think we had the best exposure from a tv standpoint in our last contract and this one is only going to enhance it more
7665169 ive talked to the mccain campaign a little bit about the issue but certainly not about me being in that mix
7665170 i think the republican party is grasping at straws clearly i find it fascinating that rudy giuliani is out there lauding hillary clinton his political nemesis they have a history im sure this has a lot to do with joe bidens great one liner in the debates in the primaries where he said that rudy giuliani was known for three words one of which is 9 11 i and 9 11 which is to say that giuliani didnt have a lot of depth and a lot of substance so i think theyre scrambling because biden is such a solid pick for the democratic party
7665171 i expect a bounce coming out of the democratic convention for senator obama he must not only define himself but he must define himself in relation to senator mccain so hes got to do two things hes got to define mccain and define himself and show america what the differences are between the two of them
7665172 i think in the end democrats will unite around barack obama as the leader of the democratic party going into this election
7665173 yeah so it said stop then someone put writing underneath of it like this
7665174 really in american years oh so sorry i thought you were 27
7665175 its time for a change i may be old but i am an old person who believes in young ideas
7665176 i was probably the most visible hillary supporter there was
7665177 she didnt win i can accept that and i think most people are accepting that
7665178 bottom line we as a party cant afford another bush kind of term
7665179 i liked hillary i saw what she went through with the republicans and she didnt cave in
7665180 but i am not about to vote republican because she isnt the nominee
7665181 we took the bacon down to one day a week
7665182 its just something everyone loves you walk in schools and smell that bacon frying and the kids go crazy
7665183 to tell you the truth i had no idea how it is supposed to be spelled
7665184 i would look for state specific items i would look for items that were put out by special interest groups
7665185 there were many many buttons made because the invention was new
7665186 you can pick up bryan buttons that are over 100 years old for 30 or you can pick them up for 3 000 plus
7665187 you push a button and his hand pops up so hes thumbing his nose

7665189 the water goes all to where my house is so the water goes down it seeps though
7665190 as we near what we originally expected to be the full length of the mission we are all thrilled with how well the mission is going
7665191 in the first two cells we analyzed samples from the surface and the ice interface and the results look similar our objective for cell 3 is to use it as an exploratory cell to look at something that might be different
7665192 the appeal of stone soup is that this deep area may collect and concentrate different kinds of materials
7665193 the trough between polygons is sort of a trap where things can accumulate
7665194 over a long timescale there may even be circulation of material sinking at the margins and rising at the center
7665195 we had a shootout between stone soup and white stuff in a trench called upper cupboard
7665196 if we had been able to confirm that the white material was a salt rich deposit we would have analyzed that but we were unable to confirm that with various methods
7665197 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7665198 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7665199 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7665200 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees
7665201 welcome to the united snakes land of the thief home of the slave

7665203 i know him not as a politician but as a husband and a father and a man and i want to talk about that and why i think hell be an extraordinary president she says in an interview airing this evening on npr news
7665204 i want people to understand who we are as a family what our values are
7665205 i think the overall theme is that there really is more that unites us than divides us she says
7665206 and when you think about the values that have shaped our lives our story is the great american story of success and pulling yourself up and making lemonade out of lemons
7665207 i mean i joke because i dont like to be involved in the process stuff quite frankly i know barack i trust him implicitly he is smart he has good judgment and i knew that he would pick the best person to help him not win in november but to lead and i think he did an outstanding job in picking his running mate
7665208 i know his plans and policies she tells all things considered host michele norris

7665239 ich habe immer noch ein lautes pfeifen im rechten ohr und sp re einen extremen druck bei den gleichgewichtstests die die rzte mit mir durchgef hrt haben bin ich immer wieder nach rechts gekippt falls sich das nicht ndert kann ich nicht mehr fu ball spielen die n chsten 14 tage stehe ich weiter unter beobachtung
7665240 in sterreich sind bengalische feuer in den stadien erlaubt nach unserem 1 0 hat ein austria fan einen knallk rper geworfen der ber meinen kopf flog ich dachte dass es ein bengalisches feuer w re danach kann ich mich nur noch an den knall erinnern
7665241 ich habe mich immer gefragt warum petrik sander so leidet jetzt wei ich welche h lle er durchgemacht hat
7665242 das pfeifen habe ich immer noch im ohr und es wird wohl auch nicht weggehen
7665243 endlich ich freue mich sehr jetzt bin ich eine richtige hamburgerin
7665244 ein teil von mir bleibt armenisch viele armenier sind stolz auf mich dass ich unserem land ehre mache
7665245 wait till the cake comes out the kitchen before you eat it
7665246 er ist einer der drei besten jungen verteidiger in brasilien ich glaube nicht dass wir da einen fehler machen
7665247 er ist ein guter mann letzte saison waren wir dran es hat sich schwierig gestaltet dann hatte alex silva einen kreuzbandriss
7665248 alex silva hat ein gutes kopfballspiel und ist stark im zweikampf verhalten im defensiv spiel hat er vom potenzial alles
7665249 zu dem einkauf kann man den hsv nur begl ckw nschen ich wundere mich dass da kein gro er klub aufgesprungen ist eigentlich w re er ein spieler f r milan chelsea oder madrid
7665250 alex silva ist ein gro er und sehr schlaksiger spieler der gerne nach vorne marschiert wenn es bei seiner mannschaft nicht so l uft er ist ein hnlicher typ wie bayerns lucio eine gute verpflichtung
7665251 das war mit sicherheit eines der schlimmsten rennen f r mich alles zu probieren aber trotzdem nur neunter zu werden
7665252 wir brauchen dazu zwei autos die in der lage sind ordentlich zu punkten
7665253 bei heidfeld wird es ernst das war j mmerlich ein hersteller wie bmw kann sich keinen fahrer leisten der eine halbe sekunde hinter dem teamkollegen herf hrt
7665254 bei uns geht es zwar nicht ums geld das h tten superstars wie die zeller br der woanders verdienen k nnen aber wir bieten berufliche perspektive
7665255 man merkt schon den neid der anderen die argw hnisch auf uns schauen
7665256 mit den olympiasiegern und einem platz in der ersten liga sind wieder interessant f r die top stars es werden anfragen kommen
7665257 ich habe zwar auch von dem angeblichen interesse erfahren aber wir haben kein angebot vorliegen zweitens k nnen sich das die vereine auch sparen kuba spielt in unserem konzept eine ganz wichtige rolle
7665258 der junge hat ein unglaubliches potenzial keiner soll vergessen dass er gerade mal 22 jahre ist und sich erst an das tempo der bundesliga gew hnen musste
7665259 es ist zwar besser geworden mit meiner schulter aber ich kann noch nicht sagen ob es f r atletico reicht
7665260 nur k rperliche gr e ist f r mich keine st rke
7665261 und auch als ich gesehen habe wie matthias steiner beim gewichtheben f r deutschland olympiagold holte hatte ich einen schwachen moment
7665262 wenn der trainer die sportliche entscheidung trifft dass rafinha in madrid spielt h tte ich damit absolut kein problem
7665263 rafinha fliegt auf jeden fall mit ist definitiv im kader fit ist er auch und alle spieler die fit sind k nnten gegen atletico spielen
7665264 rafinha ist ein teil unserer mannschaft und wird alles f r den erfolg geben
7665265 ich habe mir die szenen mehrmals im tv angesehen auch in der super slomotion und ich muss sagen dass beide gelbe karten leider leider berechtigt waren der schiedsrichter hat da korrekt entschieden
7665266 die erste gelbe kann man kriegen die zweite gelbe sollte man nicht kriegen das muss mark verinnerlichen zum eigenen wohl und auch zum wohl der mannschaft wichtig ist dass er einsieht dass es ein fehler war aber ich glaube dass er wei dass er sich selbst und der mannschaft einen b rendienst erwiesen hat
7665267 j rgen klinsmann hat mark unter anderem auch deshalb zum kapit n gemacht um so etwas zu vermeiden
7665268 gro z giger als werder sich verhalten hat kann man nicht sein
7665269 wir m ssen sehen in welcher verfassung er ist dann schauen wir ob es schon f r einen einsatz am samstag reicht
7665270 ich dachte der schiedsrichter macht einen witz als er mir die rote karte vor die nase hielt es war mein erstes foul im gesamten spiel
7665271 so ein mist jetzt bin ich sonntag beim liga start in la coruna gesperrt
7665272 ich bin gl cklich bei madrid spielen zu d rfen meine rote karte sollte wirklich nur ein ausrutscher bleiben
7665273 ich bin sehr froh dass ich endlich zeigen konnte was ich kann
7665274 vier kilo habe ich jetzt weg aber mit meiner einwechslung habe ich noch nicht gerechnet
7665275 von sechs kilo sind erst drei runter es war klar dass das etwas l nger dauern w rde
7665276 patrick sieht seinen fehler ein und wird eine summe an eine soziale einrichtung zahlen
7665277 beim trainer hat er sich schon entschuldigt dienstag wird er das auch vor der mannschaft tun
7665278 es hat mich und den rest des teams schon verwundert dass joe nicht spielen durfte
7665279 der trainer und die mitspieler sind mit respekt zu behandeln wir sind eine einheit was patrick da gesagt hat geht so nicht
7665280 wahrscheinlich k nnte nicht mal albert einstein erkl ren warum ich nicht gespielt habe das hat mich sehr ge rgert
7665281 wenn die emotionen runtergefahren sind reden wir auch mit ihm dar ber alle mit einem klaren kopf
7665282 das ist jetzt ein lernproze f r viele unserer profis dass sie durch die breite des kaders und die anzahl der spiele auch mal ersetzbar sind in anderen klubs ist das lange blich es ist gut dass unser trainer die qual der wahl hat
7665283 die spieler werden sich daran gew hnen m ssen mal auf der bank zu sitzen wir werden es nicht hinnehmen dass jeder seine befindlichkeiten nach au en tr gt
7665284 a lot of people hear about a broader agenda and they think oh evangelicals are giving up on believing that life begins at conception theyre not giving up on that at all not at all
7665285 really the safest thing you can do is make all your food at home from scratch period
7665286 sometimes we buy the product anyway and sometimes we dont
7665287 what does this really mean can i count on it as a consumer to really have any meaning
7665288 advisory labeling may not be protecting the health of allergic consumers
7665289 not suitable for consumption by persons with an allergy to x
7665290 maybe illustrates how difficult it can be when you have food allergies to stay on top of that information
7665291 the christian church must be a place that powerfully conveys compassionate truth to hurting women
7665292 my goal is to help more women find real hope and help as they journey towards wholeness in their femininity in christ and to equip others to do the same
7665293 i felt a wave of hot air sweeping all over me and a terrible smell of burning
7665294 i immediately unfastened the safety belt and fell to the floor the air was cooler there and we could breathe
7665295 i felt a wave of hot air sweeping all over me and a terrible smell of burning
7665296 i immediately unfastened the safety belt and fell to the floor the air was cooler there and we could breathe
7665297 nichts kann mich dazu bringen gegen diese mafia zu schweigen
7665298 i am personally opposed to abortion but i cant impose my views on everyone
7665299 if we create or become a mirror image of the religious right we have failed if we have increased the number of chairs around the table we have succeeded
7665300 whats impressive about princeton is that so many students have been involved in actively opposing the hookup culture
7665301 promiscuity is not a good way to live its not a healthy way to live its not a morally healthy way to live and the students here have been willing to make that argument not only to their fellow students but to the administration
7665302 have had little exposure to traditional moral teaching and limited accountability for such behavior
7665303 the consistent deterioration of the bible as the source of moral truth has led to a nation where people have become independent judges of right and wrong basing their choices on feelings and circumstances it is not likely that america will return to a more traditional moral code until the nation experiences significant pain from its moral choices
7665304 a persons life has such a great value that we cannot take it
7665305 a deputy pulled his firearm fearing for his safety the situation was deflated as quickly as it began
7665306 we have nearly finished the dismantling and cleaning of the wreckage weve removed all the bodies
7665307 so far there are some 20 people alive in accordance with the preliminary data there were citizens from a few countries from three to four countries including china kazakhstan canada iran kyrgyzstan both the plane and the crew were from kyrgyzstan the plane a boeing 737 was built in 1979
7665308 people are getting used to the idea that theres more to a phone than talking
7665309 the concept of mash ups thats going to be a big deal
7665310 my boyfriend is always telling me im beautiful and sexy and stuff like that but hed better seeing as i give him sex
7665311 i think men are really scared when they dont know me
7665312 i felt a wave of hot air sweeping all over me and a terrible smell of burning
7665313 isnt getting dirty and fucking a mechanic right there in the garage every womans secret fantasy
7665314 what was i thinking about while i was taking these pictures
7665315 i have no idea tomorrows like the first day at preschool for me i am just happy to be on the panel and ill sit wherever they put me
7665316 anything to do with the show in terms of the format and the sitting and all those things i really am not privy to
7665317 i just know that im on the judging panel and that im supposed to have my makeup done by 11 a m tomorrow thats pretty much all i know beyond that i leave it to the brains behind the show to answer those questions
7665318 of course but its really flattering too to think that theyd even thought about me
7665319 when i got the call i thought they were calling the wrong person so im the new kid on the block and im hoping everyones going to go easy on me and that i bring a lot to the table
7665320 i think my insight might be different just because i have different opinions and my approach will be different id say im going to be a straight shooter and say it like i see it and just maintain that philosophy and also try to help the contestants
7665321 im just somebody whos really honest and gives my opinion and if i feel i need to be hard with someone in order to get that across i will be and if i feel i need to be softer or more nurturing with some of the contestants ill be that it really depends on the situation
7665322 anybody with the right brain would say something like that shes on a big big show and shes just probably pondering what could happen like anybody would
7665323 i think that people are on the show as part of their journey whether theyre going to be huge artists or not theyre there to learn something and no matter what the experience is going to help them learn so criticism can also be constructive im not going to be on the show to just nail people im also going to be on there to also help them
7665324 for me im really looking for someone who is unique who has a great style an incredible stage presence and a great voice im looking for the next big thing thats what im looking for
7665325 bert omalleys scientific discoveries have opened new areas of science and his expertise is well known throughout the world
7665326 his leadership at baylor is legendary the fundamental research of dr omalley and his colleagues has laid the groundwork for innovative medical therapies that have benefitted countless patients
7665327 a bad year for credit card holders with balances to pay
7665328 anybody who hasnt consolidated should consolidate before the law goes into effect
7665329 the appeal of consolidation under current law now is youre taking a variable rate and locking in at a fixed rate its going to be a dismal year for student aid
7665330 affiliate members can post the link we provide anywhere they want in their blogs email signatures on their myspace page or even on personal websites the more links that are posted the more borrowers apply the more money is made its that easy
7665331 we wanted our program to be informative and easy to use from the very beginning so our members can focus on getting their program underway without worrying about getting around a huge learning curve
7665332 weve been providing helpful savings for borrowers through our consolidation program for years now it only made sense for us to develop an easy to use affiliate program that would help even more people consolidate by providing earnings for those who want to help their peers
7665333 while the release liner market remains a strategic focus for wausau paper the high cost structure of the liner machine at our otis mill has made it uncompetitive in todays business environment
7665334 sales improved significantly in july 2008 and remained above the 400 000 level for the third consecutive month
7665335 deeply discounted distressed sales continue to drive volume in many regions of the state july also was the first full month during which the effects of higher 729 000 conforming loan limits likely had an impact on closed sales
7665336 year to year increases in the number of transactions ranged from a 6 7 percent increase in the san francisco bay area to a 176 5 percent increase in the riverside san bernardino region in general greater percentage gains occurred in lower priced areas that had been most adversely affected by the market downturn since late 2005 and that are concurrently experiencing the biggest declines in prices
7665337 what we are seeing right now is an assumption in the market that there will be increases in the baseline interest rate in the coming months to 5 or higher what this means for students is that the projected rates for student loans are likely to go up possibly as high as 7 55 before the rates are finalized at the end of may
7665338 russia intends to inform various wto partners of its withdrawal from accords that contradict its interests
7665339 it turns out that we dont see or feel any pluses from membership and if there are some we still carry a burden
7665340 we need to get things clear with our partners we need to think most seriously about protecting our manufacturers
7665341 this doesnt mean we should renounce our strategic course towards the wto but there should be some clarifications on this question elementary fairness should prevail
7665342 une vie de rencontres provoqu es par un immense culot

7665345 estoy profundamente preocupado por la solicitud de hoy al presidente dimitri medvedev del consejo de la federaci n rusa y la duma la c mara alta y la baja del parlamento ruso para que reconozca las regiones georgianas de abjazia y osetia del sur como pa ses independientes
7665346 insto a los l deres rusos a que cumplan sus compromisos y no reconozcan estas regiones separatistas
7665347 rusia tiene que respetar la independencia territorial y la soberan a de georgia
7665348 alarmados por las informaciones sobre los planes de rusia de reconocer a abjazia y osetia del sur
7665349 el estatus de esas dos regiones de georgia no es un asunto a decidir por ning n pa s es un asunto para la comunidad internacional mediante los mecanismo en naciones unidas
7665350 hoy es un d a hist rico para abjazia y osetia del sur
7665351 respalda plenamente la pol tica del presidente de rusia hacia osetia del sur y abjasia
7665352 est claro que despu s de la agresi n contra osetia del sur las relaciones con georgia no pueden volver a su anterior situaci n
7665353 we will reaffirm the commitment in bucharest and the meeting is also expected to approve a package of measures to support georgia
7665354 i think the allies are going to be firm that this was a violation of georgias territorial integrity
7665355 we think we can prevent a problem that could have as much impact as the s amp l crisis
7665356 the fbi correctly diagnosed that mortgage fraud was epidemic but it did not come close to meeting its announced goal
7665357 it used everyday procedures and woefully inadequate resources to deal with an epidemic
7665358 the approach was certain to bring symbolic prosecutions and strategic defeat
7665359 we were dealing with the issue as best we could back then
7665360 i think most sitting u s attorneys now staring at the subprime crisis find scant resources available to pursue sophisticated financial crimes
7665361 i am happy to have investigations going on but these investigations should have taken place years ago
7665362 they seem to always get involved after the horse has left the barn it is always cleaning up the mess rather than being proactive
7665363 until there is a catastrophic loss there is no incentive to investigate criminal conduct
7665364 the industry and visitors are giving us their clear support to continue with the fair in leipzig
7665365 the air force has increased the sheer volume of pilots put through the training pipeline and shipped them off to war with the bare minimum training required
7665366 have come directly from basic training as their first exposure to the professional workforce
7665367 this is stuff we can correct through training stuff that happens between the ears
7665368 flight safety is of paramount importance to the air force and every mishap is carefully studied in order to mitigate future risk
7665369 not that he should have known the rules he did know
7665370 a unique technology that has not been applied successfully to an airplane
7665371 metropcs wants everyone to have unlimited afforable access to all that wireless has to offer
7665372 we are investing millions of dollars on state of the art networks technology that rivals anything in the world that will give our customers unlimited freedom to communicate the way they want to not by the rules or traditional wireless carriers
7665373 you have to start early because during session you arent allowed to campaign

7665375 when it comes time for election ill let someone else take it over ive got plenty on my plate
7665376 have come directly from basic training as their first exposure to the professional workforce
7665377 this is stuff we can correct through training stuff that happens between the ears
7665378 flight safety is of paramount importance to the air force and every mishap is carefully studied in order to mitigate future risk
7665379 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7665380 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7665381 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7665382 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7665383 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7665384 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7665385 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7665386 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7665387 we only know the engine had problems and they did not make a successful landing
7665388 theres not a thing he can do at this point were working with the u s embassy to have all of the arrangements made for the repatriation of those who are deceased and medical flights for those living
7665389 there were farmers in the field where they crashed they pulled my husband out of the plane 30 seconds before the plane exploded
7665390 he has constant pain he says he can deal with hes just grateful to be alive
7665391 he did everything he was a carpenter a multipurpose utility player he was a very popular employee forever upbeat
7665392 he was very giving i think he was in africa last year
7665393 we fully expect that both the number of suspected and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be tested
7665394 other hotels are in the works for wenatchee that would indicate that theres interest in moving forward
7665395 it gives them time to hopefully reach an agreement with a new purchaser
7665396 it behooves the current owners to operate it to its maximum potential
7665397 its the largest hotel in the market its a substantial investment
7665398 the economy in wenatchee is quite strong because its diverse i think its just a very big financial package and it takes some time to put it together
7665399 its a nice property the locations right on the river and the restaurants on the top floor they have a nice view up there
7665400 business sometimes takes a while but theres a buyer for everything
7665401 this is a large and important investment now that steel production has to be tied to the countrys plans for economic development from the mining sector through steel manufacturing and even some elements of processing
7665402 we have been told that not for profit organisations such as ours can apply for a refund of the application fee which may be granted either fully or partially but there is no guarantee
7665403 in the past we have passed every cent of the money raised over to the salvos and we didnt think the members or the public would be very impressed with 400 of what should be money for charity being handed over to the bega valley shire council
7665404 after the first year there needs to be a da for any ongoing use
7665405 then if it is for a charitable organisation and there are good grounds the fee is totally refunded
7665406 we are looking at revising the policy to reflect this sort of situation
7665407 the decision is ultimately made by council but we are following up and looking at the policy
7665408 under these circumstances it is my view the fee is too much and we should be looking at charitable organisations not having to pay upfront
7665409 but it is a policy that council staff will need to look at with perhaps a recommendation for a change coming to the new council
7665410 we need to look at those rules and make sure they are appropriate
7665411 at batemans bay about 10 motorcycling parking spaces have been provided in the main street utilising areas that could not be used for car parking

7665427 we keep procrastinating about what to do and you got to do something doing something is better than doing nothing
7665428 weve had this progression of politicians that have come down here and said well get you some more fresh water from upstream i think theres a couple of megalitres up there that no one is telling us about and well get you fresh water and nothing happens

7665435 heureusement lhindouisme nest pas une religion detat cest pourquoi les saints ne sont pas dangereux tandis que leurs fid les les admirent pas tant que a du reste il y a toujours un musulman un bouddhiste ou un catholique pour les regarder avec compassion ironie ou curiosit
7665436 will there be any shared content between lbp and home
7665437 just down the road from us im looking forward to getting the littlebigplanet space in there working on it and making it cool
7665438 political business or technology reasons there is always a time when i have to return when we look ten years into the future maybe yes i may well end up spending more time on the metal gear series
7665439 in mgs4 yes i put everything in the cut sequences which i kind of regret to some extent because maybe there is a new approach which i should think about
7665440 lack a kind of deeper storyline or the expression of the feelings of the characters
7665441 to find so much crime and gunfire in the city of york concerns me
7665442 sie legten ihn mir um und sagten ich solle ihn zu hause abnehmen
7665443 sie haben mir nicht befohlen mich in die luft zu sprengen
7665444 nach den j ngsten rentenreformen werden sich die beitragsrenditen zwar verringern bleiben aber auch k nftig positiv
7665445 it took me five years to figure out what to put there
7665446 if the allegations are proven then of course his future in the club and in the game will come into question
7665447 at this stage the best solution for all parties is that the legal process is allowed to unfold with greg off the field
7665448 we acknowledge that the club is taking the matter extremely seriously
7665449 it was pretty cut and dried circumstances and the matters were not contested by the player
7665450 from what i understand happened this morning at court greg and his counsel said theyd be strongly defending the allegations its a slightly different situation
7665451 certainly if theres a full admission then clubs are able to act more quickly than otherwise
7665452 he certainly wont be training or playing with the nrl team and id say its highly unlikely hed be playing again this year
7665453 theyre very disappointed but were basically at the 30km mark of a marathon and were not going back to the starting blocks
7665454 certainly we would respect and support any ban the club has on the player
7665455 theres a small discrepancy about the make of the vehicle
7665456 its manufactured in china and is sold under the brand name zap here in the united states but penndot feels the vehicle has to be titled as qingqi which is the chinese manufacturer
7665457 when someone takes a qingqi from pennsylvania and goes to new york say and its titled as a zap im concerned there may be an issue there
7665458 we told mr cronin what he needs to do to sell these vehicles if he has any other questions he can call us
7665459 funny all the righteous indignation and caustic language towards a shamed and apologetic john edwards john mccain has had far more affairs

7665463 estoy muy feliz de ser el n mero uno es una enorme satisfacci n despu s de estar tanto tiempo en el dos pero nada cambia
7665464 la presi n es la misma ahora que hace tres semanas cuando quieres ganar el objetivo y la presi n son los mismos
7665465 seguir progresando y mejorando en mi tenis y seguir jugando bien en los torneos es el nico objetivo

7665498 the evening is being put on as a joint partnership and it came about really because both sides of the partnership kept on getting calls from people asking for the same information
7665499 the evening will be an important opportunity for locals to get information that they need and we will also have a solicitor from the inner city legal centre on hand the following day for people to make individual appointments with if they have further questions

7665509 bmw hat bewiesen dass auch die hersteller von premiumfahrzeugen den co2 aussto ernsthaft verringern k nnen
7665510 aber der langsame fortschritt der meisten autobauer zeigt dass die eu den druck mit ambitionierten langfristigen co2 zielen aufrecht erhalten muss
7665511 je weniger zonen es gibt desto weniger verhandlungen muss der neuanbieter f hren und desto einfacher wird sein marktzugang
7665512 die versorger f rchten um ihre regionalen monopole und spielen auf zeit bislang mit erfolg
7665513 das kann dazu f hren dass einzelne banken den zins bei den refinanzierungsauktionen der ezb nach oben treiben wenn die nachfrage nach liquidit t weiter gro ist
7665514 trotz geplanter nderungen will die ezb offenbar weiterhin nicht auf die vorteile eines flexiblen sicherheitenrahmens verzichten
7665515 die palette der von der ezb akzeptierten sicherheiten ist so gro dass es kaum engp sse geben sollte wenn sie nun bei abs die z gel ein wenig anzieht
7665516 sie wollen behutsam vorgehen und die banken nicht ins offene messer laufen lassen

7665519 any effort outside them will be unconstitutional consensus and cooperation of the people is necessary but it is parliament and parliament alone which has the legitimate authority to make the changes
7665520 any other path will be illegal and invariably subject to challenge in the courts bypassing the constitution will compound the problems facing the country not resolve them
7665521 this is a very credible result despite the adversity in the market over the last 12 months
7665522 that we were able to generate a 21 per cent increase in normalised earnings before interest and tax in such conditions is a reflection of the strength of our diversified financial services business
7665523 were delighted with where the company is right now mike and the board came to a mutual conclusion you know these things evolve over a period
7665524 we believe that the difficult market conditions will continue to affect the sector for some time to come
7665525 from the markets perspective this is such a drawn out process i dont think they are focusing on these individual events just yet
7665526 i think they are still getting to grips with the spectre that the commodities boom could be over
7665527 other stakeholders to ensure the business could compete effectively in the local market
7665528 we are delighted with anzs approach and that it shares our confidence in the tricom business and the opportunities ahead mr rosenberg said

7665546 um time que quer ser campe o n o pode errar tanto assim e eu n o estou falando de zagueiros ou de laterais todo mundo errou a marca o come a na frente e muitas vezes a gente acaba tomando gols porque errou no ataque precisamos melhorar o nosso aproveitamento e trabalhar as bolas paradas vamos tentar aproveitar essa semana sem jogos para isso
7665547 n s temos tomado muitos gols em lances de bolas a reas mas todo mundo pode ver que n o falta treinamento trabalhamos muito esse tipo de jogada mas acho que o problema a aten o do pessoal mesmo precisamos encostar mais para isso n o voltar a acontecer
7665548 n s temos jogadores de qualidade e o posicionamento sempre muito trabalhado temos treinado demais para consertar esses erros mas eles t m acontecido claro que n o estamos satisfeitos mas muito complicado e n o temos conseguido reagir
7665549 we fully expect that both the number of suspected and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be tested
7665550 it wasnt a liquid market particularly as its the last week of the northern summer
7665551 its difficult to put a story around the price action in the last 12 hours

7665562 ele pediu para se tratar no cruzeiro porque gosta do clube sabe que um dolo aqui um lugar onde ele sempre foi bem tratado mas se ele estiver 100 recuperado nada impede o cruzeiro de fazer um contrato com o sor n assim como o s o paulo fez com o adriano da inter de mil o
7665563 n o decidi ainda a forma o trabalhei a primeira parte com o morais porque achei que a maneira como terminamos o jogo n o foi bem ent o trabalhei com ele para entrosar com o douglas por aquele lado j que temos o lulinha e elias pela direita
7665564 n o jogamos nada s olhamos chegamos atrasados n o tivemos o brio que precis vamos ter o cruzeiro estava abaixo da cr tica

7665573 apareceram algumas coisas mas nada de concreto eu s vou acreditar quando baterem o martelo enquanto isso vou trabalhar duro para agarrar as chances que tiver aqui
7665574 the development of the law has been to equalize the status of children born to married and unmarried parents we were able to make enormous gains on behalf of same sex parents and their children in that context without marriage on the radar screen at all
7665575 thats what we say in every custody case thats what we say every time somebody says we shouldnt be able to adopt children
7665576 the whole body of law affecting lesbian mothers in custody cases developing second parent adoption developing de facto parenthood all of the ground we gained over decades in that area came out of courts because judges who hear family court matters often care about the well being of individual children and theyre not in a political hotspot
7665577 are where its the biological mother herself whos trying to say that a state should not recognize a second parent adoption that she participated in in another state
7665578 that is how we get these bad decisions that say a child only has one mother when in fact she has two
7665579 id like to think im a poster child for how to handle a split up in that context in a way that continues and protects the childs relationship with both parents we actually did her other mothers second parent adoption years after we split up im sensitive to the feelings people have in those situations but i believe that if you create a two parent family you should not under any circumstances act as though the child has only one parent i didnt and i expect other people not to also
7665580 barack obama may be one of the first people to inspire others the way john f kennedy did and robert f kennedy did
7665581 there was another time when another young candidate was running for president and challenging america to cross a new frontier
7665582 he faced criticism from the preceding democratic president who was widely respected in the party
7665583 has really been in the forefront of protecting reproductive freedom education reform minimum wage and civil rights
7665584 at least if hillary clinton was the nominee you could show that picture again
7665585 the clintons are on the 60s side of the baby boom generation
7665586 would i now give this brother a cup of water in jesus name
7665587 many of us are so hurt by what has happened that we would say no
7665588 as you have done it to the least of these you have done it to me
7665589 increasing health care costs and an influx of expensive drugs and tests combined with an aging population set off a health care crisis in the united states contending with soaring costs insurers changed the business of health care by requiring preauthorizations mandating cheaper drugs and tightening controls on treatment decisions
7665590 efficiently manage the costs of covering health care for millions of people
7665591 balance the needs of patients with the budgetary constraints of businesses that pay for the coverage
7665592 the law and order situation in nwfp and fata will not be solved until theres a stable government in islamabad
7665593 saving lives should be the first issue then we can look at the judges
7665594 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7665595 only a political agreement not a part of the quran
7665596 are we now a laughingstock for those who didnt want democracy in pakistan for them its a victory but were both losers
7665597 the world is losing the war i think at the moment they the taliban definitely have the upper hand
7665598 the issue is not just a bad case scenario as far as pakistan is concerned or as afghanistan is concerned but it is going to be spreading further the whole world is going to be affected by it
7665599 my best moment i have a lot of good moments but the one i prefer is when i kicked the hooligan
7665600 i didnt study i live you cant study these things life teaches them to you you dont find them in a book ive read a lot of socrates on page 3 of the sun
7665601 football is like making love if you cant last 90 minutes like me you wont win
7665602 non so quanto ci si possa fidare per sono notizie talmente generali e alcune anche gi circolate che potrebbe essere tutto vero source lily via darkufo sapremo cosa successo a claire sar rivelato il futuro della rousseau e di richard alpert continueremo a vedere jin e locke la maggior parte degli episodi saranno centrati sugli oceanic 6 e sul loro tentativo di far ritorno sullisola e su come jack cercher di convincerli a farlo kate e sawyer si riuniranno nuovamente scopriremo come libby sia finita nellospedale di saluta mentale dove era ricoverato anche hurley
7665603 my best moment i have a lot of good moments but the one i prefer is when i kicked the hooligan
7665604 i didnt study i live you cant study these things life teaches them to you you dont find them in a book ive read a lot of socrates on page 3 of the sun
7665605 football is like making love if you cant last 90 minutes like me you wont win
7665606 a knowing and willful attempt to violate the strictures of federal election law
7665607 i saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
7665608 our fighters had hopes of winning despite the judges but it was useless they were condemned beforehand
7665609 every discipline every human and material resource that we dedicate to sport
7665610 there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism
7665611 moskva has today departed toward the black sea fleets naval training range to check its radio controlled weapons and onboard communications systems
7665612 the fact that there are nine western warships in the black sea cannot but be a cause for concern they include two u s warships one each from spain and poland and four from turkey
7665613 it was obviously the news i didnt want to hear
7665614 but after listening to the doctors explanation i am convinced that this is the right procedure the right way to go
7665615 someone has already raised that yesterday and i havent really talked to anyone at this point in time about anything to be honest with you
7665616 i am sure that general manager jerry reese and i and ownership will look long and hard at whatever options are out there and do what is best here at this point in time
7665617 we are after all democrats so it may take a while
7665618 were not the fall in line party we are diverse but make no mistake we are unified
7665619 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7665620 were going to make sure that we win on november 4 so lets have a great convention
7665621 during our national convention we will demonstrate to all americans why we need barack obama and joe biden in the white house
7665622 she had the experience and judgment to be president now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain
7665623 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7665624 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes
7665625 i think the republican party is grasping at straws clearly i find it fascinating that rudy giuliani is out there lauding hillary clinton his political nemesis they have a history im sure this has a lot to do with joe bidens great one liner in the debates in the primaries where he said that rudy giuliani was known for three words one of which is 9 11 i and 9 11 which is to say that giuliani didnt have a lot of depth and a lot of substance so i think theyre scrambling because biden is such a solid pick for the democratic party
7665626 i expect a bounce coming out of the democratic convention for senator obama he must not only define himself but he must define himself in relation to senator mccain so hes got to do two things hes got to define mccain and define himself and show america what the differences are between the two of them
7665627 i think in the end democrats will unite around barack obama as the leader of the democratic party going into this election
7665628 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7665629 run on the bank people who are withdrawing funds could receive too high a payment because properties are evaluated higher than they should be this would be unfair to those who remain with the fund
7665630 run on the bank people who are withdrawing funds could receive too high a payment because properties are evaluated higher than they should be this would be unfair to those who remain with the fund
7665631 the safety security sic of such funds is an essential element of the american financial system

7665648 nonostante queste persone abbiano chiaramente rubato della propriet intellettuale credo ci siano strade migliori per risolvere queste faccende ricorrendo al nostro ruolo di sviluppatori e distributori

7665652 philosophical questions about mean variance analyses and optimizations is it important for an investor in the accumulation phase to control portfolio variance assuming this is a buy and hold investor not prone to behavioral panics obviously portfolio variance is important in the withdrawal phase but i was hoping to get some feedback on the utility of minimizing variance in the accumulation phase
7665653 im guessing that if you used data intervals of more than one month youd have less of a need to make the potentially controversial decision to constrain the optimization to be sure a larger sample size does allow you to predict return and risk within a narrower confidence interval but its all past data anyway so its not like youre going to be 99 confident that the future is going to resemble the past even with the larger sample
7665654 going with the flow through atlanta at 85 mph so i pick my time to drive there

7665665 the country club syndrome this is the peculiar affliction of the very wealthy if you have your own jet vacation in tony resorts and send your children to the most exclusive private schools then surely you cant use the same money managers as the little folks youre above all that you must engage investment firms and apply techniques available only to the elite after all telling the swells at the country club that you send your checks to vanguard simply will not do

7665667 the individual investor would do well to avoid using any filter rule and i might add any broker who recommends it
7665668 unhappily the signals generated by the dow mechanism have no significance for predicting future price movements
7665669 it is clear that if there are exceptional financial managers they are very rare and there is no way of telling in advance who they will be

7665675 demonstrates the central paradox of portfolio diversification obviously a concentrated portfolio maximizes your chance of a superb result unfortunately at the same time it also maximizes your chance of a poor result this issue gets to the heart of why we invest you can have two possible goals one is to maximize your chances of getting rich i e active management the other is to minimize your odds of failing to meet your goals i e indexing it is important to realize that these goals are mutually exclusive
7665676 desde que parei de fazer filmes ingressei num ciclo diferente mas a tenho a impress o de que h alguma coisa se preparando ainda n o sei o que ser
7665677 depois de 70 anos entendi que minha primeira grande vantagem na vida foi conquistada aos 5 anos de idade aprendi a ler e escrever

7665687 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border
7665688 one of the first things we did was to notify all officers in our department of the situation
7665689 we are aware of it and we are addressing it
7665690 cbp is on heightened alert ever since we became aware of the threats in mexico
7665691 we are closely monitoring these developments and will act accordingly to protect the integrity of the border
7665692 we are always in the business of analyzing this type of information
7665693 its further evidence of the blatant just the audacity of these cartels
7665694 youve got three cartels in juarez with a fight between the gulf and the sinaloa cartels along with the juarez cartel so that might have contributed to pushing some people across the border
7665695 unfortunately in an environment in which medical costs continue to rise and managed care and corporate executives scrutinize expenses and minimize discretionary investments we think healthways high priced services stand to lose ground
7665696 should management opt to reduce prices to compete more effectively it will likely be at the expense of margins and earnings
7665697 the management team is unwilling to adjust to a rapid moving environment
7665698 the good products it had that were good six months ago are not necessarily good for right now
7665699 we recognize the significant challenges our existing and potential customers face in this uncertain economic environment and with increasing costs of health care
7665700 while these factors will likely impact the certainty of timing for converting industry demand into new business we continue to be pleased with industry trends that reflect solid demand

7665724 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7665725 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7665726 this has been the most significant outbreak in recent memory and the public deserves to know what may have contributed to it and what can be done to better deal with future outbreaks
7665727 we also need to know if the hospital should have been put into lockdown earlier than was actually done
7665728 the public need to know that when these things happen in our public hospitals the authorities learn what the can to limit the disruption to patient health and safety

7665948 the ultimate goal of this program is to support the recovery of rare species and natural communities and to prevent their further decline
7665949 the remaining habitat may be the last refuge for many prairie and savanna plants birds and other animals
7665950 many of these species and natural communities are uncommon or nonexistent elsewhere in wisconsin and throughout the united states
7665951 the biggest threat to rare species is loss or degradation of habitat
7665952 with more than 85 percent of wisconsins landscape under private ownership landowners play a key role in helping conserve the beauty and diversity of wisconsins natural heritage for future generations

7665954 the gravitational cycles are called the primary forcing mechanism for climate pfm and act like a magnet by pulling the atmospheres high pressure systems northward or southward by as much as 3 or 4 degrees of latitude from their normal seasonal positions and thus causing long term shifts in the location of atmospheric high pressure systems
7665955 the release of the book culminates 19 years of research clearly linking gravitational cycles as the cause for fluctuations within the earths climate the book is available as an electronic e book on this website the author david dilley is a meteorologist and climate researcher with global weather oscillations inc

7665972 there will be a price to pay if someone doesnt comply with the environmental law
7665973 its now august 2008 and we finally have a penalty in place and were finally starting to re mediate these emissions thats just not acceptable people are breathing this stuff its creating ozone for the entire region weve been in non attainment for ozone for 30 some odd years now this cannot be taking this long
7665974 her mother apparently believed that her daughter was in some type of trouble she had come to visit a friend up in oklahoma city and did not know where she was could not locate her and believe she may be involved in some type of trouble of some kind

7665976 theyre not going to be fluent in three months but my goal is to get them to feel comfortable and communicate
7665977 you have to flip flop the nouns and the verbs i could not figure that out when i was trying to learn english
7665978 its been a challenge because were so used to speaking english only i do think that english is the most important but at the time we do have spanish speakers coming in to buy cars and we want to be able to communicate
7665979 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7665980 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7665981 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7665982 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7665983 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7665984 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7665985 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise
7665986 none of us would put off maintenance on our cars and be surprised if we have a catastrophe but were more likely to build prisons than daycare centers

7665991 baird amp warner is the largest independent real estate broker in illinois and the oldest in the country and we believe this partnership will be extremely beneficial to our chicago area users

7665997 not only does it start up quickly but should anything go wrong with the application i can just re stream it
7665998 rather than run it on your own desktop youre running it on a server virtualizing the presentation layer and distributing it over the network
7665999 the uptake of xp was slower than people remember today
7666000 we have not moved to xp and we have no plans to
7666001 this is an upgrade that offers nothing to a business customer
7666002 vista really does parallel the situation with xp in a lot of ways
7666003 xp was really viewed as a glorified upgrade not a new operating system in its own right
7666004 we used to say xp was like swiss cheese full of holes everywhere
7666005 its not a bad os there are big improvements under the hood
7666006 we dont try to be at the cutting edge but we dont want to be too far behind
7666007 sooner or later we knew we were going to have to move forward
7666008 but most of the time it turns out theyre really complaining about some change in office 2007

7666023 what is the value a real estate professional brings to consumers when information about everything including real estate is so abundant on the web
7666024 if we were to build an mls today with the technology available and for the different generations of realtors home buyers and home sellers what would we include and how would we go about the task
7666025 if you dont know where you are going any road will take you there
7666026 so of what use to us as realtors is facebook none that i could see i think they are just building a data base to later sell or maybe its a dating service

7666031 we strongly believe that the more targeted an ad can be both at a national and local level the more useful the consumer will find it and the more successful the advertiser will be

7666037 the internet is a major factor in the way we do business we knew that the internet would only get stronger as time went along and because we are so easy to find on the internet we are selling homes to folks from outside our basic marketing area as well as within it
7666038 karen and i are very good friends and both of us are grandmothers
7666039 i use our internet presence as a selling point by taking some of our website reports to listing presentations to show prospective sellers that we receive plenty of traffic and lots of inquiries from our site
7666040 we work with a lot of first time homebuyers and people relocating to the amarillo area thanks to internet leads we dont have a specialty as far as type of property we sell we just sell great homes to wonderful panhandle people
7666041 and if anyone asked for my advice id tell them this never give up if you are practicing traditional real estate strategies that arent working for you anymore you might want to embrace the newer technologies and marketing strategies that utilize the internet
7666042 the incredible pressure that had been put on particularly women to support barack obama

7666058 its very good for amd not just in the virtualization market but in the high end server space where the virtualized model is the preferred mode whats really neat about this is that in the server space where virtualized machines have their strongest play traditionally its tough to partition resources well once you partition you start taking hits on performance the more performance you have the more you overcome the hits that you take when you virtualize
7666059 benchmarks are good as a unit of measurement but you have to understand what test was run what it was measuring and the environment and condition in which it was measuring
7666060 its nice to score high on a benchmark but benchmarks arent the end all be all when it comes to purchasing decisions first no benchmark can give a complete view of performance there are just too many aspects and variables

7666142 abomination of desolation refereed to in the prophecy of daniel
7666143 one might ask obviously from the context we must understand this passage of daniel and unless we have the correct interpretation of daniel we will not be able to understand the mount of olives discourse
7666144 our readers will remember that as an expositor of prophecy calvin is a praeterist and that his general system of interpretation is as remote from the year day theory of birks faber and others as from the futurist speculations of maitland tyso and todd notwithstanding the disagreement between these lectures and the writings of birks we strongly recommend their perusal by every student who would become thoroughly proficient in the prophecies of daniel the first step towards progress is to surrender all our preconceived notions and to prepare for the possibility of their vanishing away before the force of sanctified reason and all pervading truth
7666145 and it came to pass that in those days of caesar augustus
7666146 in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar
7666147 went back to his own country having shed blood and uttered words of extreme arrogance
7666148 how long will the sacrifices cease how long will gods vengeance against the wickedness of his people last
7666149 now on the twenty fifth day of the ninth month which is called chislev in the hundred and forty eighth year they rose up betimes in the morning and offered a sacrifice according to law upon the new altar of burnt offerings which they had made
7666150 indeed it so came to pass that our nation suffered these things under antiochus epiphanes according to daniels vision and what he wrote years before they came to pass
7666151 this i am convinced is why these misfortunes have overtaken me and why i am dying of melancholy in a foreign land
7666152 the figure of antichrist but i do not think this reasoning sufficiently sound
7666153 this is evident from the history of the maccabees as well as from the testimony of the evangelist john and we may collect the same conclusion from the prophecies of haggai and zechariah as the building of the temple was interrupted during forty six years cyrus permitted the people to build the temple the foundations were laid when cyrus went out to the war in scythia the jews were then compelled to cease their labors and his successor cambyses was hostile to this people hence the jews say john 2 20 forty six years was this temple in building and wilt thou build it in three days they strive to deride christ because he had said destroy this temple and i will rebuild it in future days as it was then a common expression and had been handed down by their fathers that the temple had occupied this period in its construction if you add the three years during which the foundations were laid we shall then have forty nine years or seven weeks
7666154 the son of god and the savior of the world
7666155 for there is none other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved
7666156 for then there will be great tribulation such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time no nor shall ever be
7666157 and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto for these be the days of vengeance that all the things which are written be fulfilled
7666158 but the people of the church in jerusalem had been commanded by a revelation vouchsafed to approved men there before the war to leave the city and to dwell in a certain town of perea called pella and when those that believed in christ had come thither from jerusalem then as if the royal city of the jews and the whole land of judea were entirely destitute of holy men the judgment of god at length overtook those who had committed such outrages against christ and his apostles and totally destroyed that generation of impious men a nd how at last the abomination of desolation proclaimed by the prophets stood in the very temple of god so celebrated of old the temple which was now awaiting its total and final destruction by fire all these things any one that wishes may find accurately described in the history written by josephus

7666195 union families are really charged up and ready to move in a different direction a direction that will really rebuild the middle class in this country
7666196 the issue really is that there is an unfamiliarity with barack obama hes fairly new on the scene and there are a lot of union voters white working class voters as you say who are not yet familiar with him mccain is not talking about economic issues barack obama is talking about economic issues but this is about economic issues this is about the direction of this country for working families this is about rebuilding the middle class
7666197 we have launched an intensive campaign a member to member campaign talking to union members about the issues mobilizing union leadership top to bottom in the locals in our states in our cities throughout our labor movement to make sure that union voters know the issues know where the candidates stand on the issues like trade and health care and childrens health care and social security protecting social security

7666221 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums
7666222 it wouldnt make sense for me to want to edit his remarks
7666223 during the course of a 19 month campaign i think that youre on the television screen youre in big auditoriums but sometimes who you are may get lost
7666224 the fact is we had a very hard fought primary there are going to be some of senator clintons supporters we have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
7666225 the clintons love this country they love the democratic party and they are going to be active participants in our campaign for the remaining 70 days
7666226 what has happened in the caucasia is a kind of show of strength between the west and russia
7666227 ossetia wants to be an autonomous republic and unite with russia after detaching from georgia
7666228 i think they want to bloody georgias nose and teach it a little bit of a lesson and also to show that they have interests in this region and that they intend to defend those interests
7666229 i dont think the west is going to rescue him the west is not going to fight a war for him especially not against russia an expert on caucasia journalist fehim ta tekin it is all because of the tension that has been going up since 2004 saakashvili sought support from voters during the election by making a promise that he would join abkhazia and ossetia to georgia and he has been carrying out operations on the ossetia border for two months on the other hand the presence of russian troops in the region as a peace force made the intervention inevitable the war suddenly turned into a georgia russia clash the tension in abkhazia is still going on and russia is placing great importance on this region i dont think that russia will withdraw unless georgians pull back the usa entered the caucasia through georgia in 2002 the usa wants to provoke the internal clashes of russia too given that the arms used are the usa originated the usa is obviously a side in this war russia doesnt want the usa in the region the convergence between russia and the usa died out after september 11 attacks yet russia regained power in the leadership of putin the tension of the cold war came out again russia wants to keep the usa and nato away from its own borders turkey is making the mistake of supporting georgia turkey can stand out as a peacemaker in the region

7666232 the permit could be issued at any time it could be today tomorrow next week or a few weeks time
7666233 last weeks declaration by the environment ministry with regard to terms and conditions that have satisfactorily been fulfilled by crystallex international is the final jigsaw piece in the puzzle there is absolutely nothing further needed towards the issuance of the eis permit it could be issued at any minute but you have to remember that we are in venezuela and everything now rests in the hands of the ministry to simply sign off on the permit and allow work to begin at las cristinas
7666234 this instrument enables nasa and the nation to have a unique capability for atmospheric research particularly as related to cloud climate feedback and aerosol cloud interactions the global hawk platform is capable of sustained high altitude operation with potential to circumnavigate the globe on a single flight because it is unmanned the global hawk can fly longer and can operate in regions currently inaccessible to our airborne platforms such as southern oceans or antarctica
7666235 the long duration flights possible with the global hawk platform present unique challenges for science instrumentation sigma had the opportunity to apply all its expertise in aerospace instrument engineering in this project we are grateful to be able to contribute to this unique tool for atmospheric research
7666236 we are currently working with gsfc also on the first wind lidar for high altitude platforms together these two instruments would provide a singular capability for hurricane path prediction

7666255 currently available genetically engineered crops do not increase the yield potential of a hybrid variety in fact yield may even decrease if the varieties used to carry the herbicide tolerant or insect resistant genes are not the highest yielding cultivars
7666256 however by protecting the plant from certain pests ge crops can prevent yield losses compared with non ge hybrids particularly when pest infestation is high
7666257 it has always amazed me that the archetype of the vampire is so often thought to be glamorous and powerful in reality these people are the most pathetic helpless useless weak and ineffective individuals they can do nothing for themselves having to obtain the very simplest energies and abilities from others unable to be in the most ordinary relationships without causing damage in a majickal relationship they are black holes into which unlimited amounts of energy will flow unreciprocated if not prevented

7666261 i will tell you having visited israel just a month and a half ago their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a nuclear weapon
7666262 my job as president would be to try to make sure we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that we mobilize the world community to go after irans nuclear program in a serious way we have to do it before israel feels its back is against the wall
7666263 shes been treated poorly by him he should have vetted her for vice president
7666264 i think he played the race card during the primaries it was a sexist campaign
7666265 i know hundreds of lifelong democrats who are going to vote for mccain the fact that she wasnt even vetted was a smack in the face

7666319 the bottom line is the opportunity to increase the tax base and expand the footprint of downtown
7666320 we need downtown to be more than elm street that was the goal
7666321 we propose an investment strategy that does for church street what has been done so successfully for elm
7666322 the aim should be that in five to 10 years the name church street should be synonymous with arts culture and entertainment
7666323 assuming church street could achieve the status of elm there is opportunity for 10 13 million in additional property taxes along church street over the next 30 years

7666331 why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders but eat with hands defiled
7666332 well did isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites as it is written this people honors me with their lips but their heart is far from me in vain do they worship me teaching as doctrines the precepts of men you leave the commandment of god and hold fast the tradition of men
7666333 you have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of god in order to keep your tradition for moses said honor your father and your mother and he who speaks evil of father or mother let him surely die but you say if a man tells his father or his mother what you would have gained from me is corban that is given to god then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother thus making void the word of god through your tradition which you hand on and many such things you do
7666334 hear me all of you and understand there is nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile him but the things which come out of a man are what defile him

7666337 what lies before us and what lies behind us are small matters compared to what lies within us
7666338 to see what is right and not do it is want of courage or of principle
7666339 as of what i had heard this morning every single person had been at least left a message to call us
7666340 but more than half of them had been reached directly
7666341 we have work for our first years when they get here
7666342 like many firms were taking steps to manage our expenses
7666343 what lies before us and what lies behind us are small matters compared to what lies within us
7666344 to see what is right and not do it is want of courage or of principle
7666345 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said three months we dont know the point is it that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to chose
7666346 several soldiers who deserted after a tour of duty in iraq have stated that cruelty towards iraqi citizens was a factor in their desertions one of them lance corporal ivan brobeck witnessed the abuse of iraqi detainees and the killing of iraqi civilians another sgt ricky clousing had similar experiences his allegations of systematic abuse of iraqi detainees are now being investigated by the military

7666348 showed a six minute video of long sporting dreadlocks and a beard telling a canadian news reporter i think i was lied to by my president

7666352 i feel the war on terror is a war on peace
7666353 the morality of what he did should lessen the punishment
7666354 about two dozen anti war supporters gathered around the courthouse at fort carson in colorado springs colo yesterday afternoon as a military judge handed down longs sentence
7666355 the applicant submits that if returned to the united states he will be court martialed for desertion and he will be incarcerated in a military prison where like stephen funk camilo mejia and kevin benderman he will suffer persecution and cruel and inhumane treatment
7666356 i believe the evidence here shows that if returned to the us the applicant will suffer the harm he has described

7666359 the body of the martyr abbas ali hmoud will stay in the building until the iillers are captured
7666360 ordered the formation of a committee to find out how iraqi forces came to fight each other in baquba
7666361 hussein al zubaidi a provincial council member and nazar al khafaji the diyala university dean were arrested during the raid the official said
7666362 taha dria a shiite lawmaker from diyala who was not in the government compound during the raid said the armed forces were from iraqs emergency response unit an american trained unit similar to u s special forces
7666363 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk
7666364 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense they have goals and they didnt inform anyone else
7666365 that all us troops will leave by the end of 2011
7666366 i know there are always reports out there in the press and im not sure i saw exactly what prime minister maliki said but clearly from our perspective weve been working with the iraqi government for a long time on this agreement were discussing goals as you know youve heard us speak about different kinds of timelines or aspirational goals that may be acceptable i dont have anything to announce on that an agreement has not been signed and so from our perspective there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed there are discussions that continue in baghdad wed like to let them continue and to continue to show progress what were focused on is getting a good agreement not getting an agreement by a particular date so well continue those discussions
7666367 out of the more than 151 000 families who had fled their houses in baghdad just 7 112 had returned to them by mid july according to the iraqi ministry of migration
7666368 the reasons for the hesitation are complex based on dangers both real and imagined in most cases iraqis say they feel safe with their neighbors but are not sure about other residents some are afraid of the new guards on their blocks in rarer cases they cannot face neighbors who they suspect helped in killings
7666369 i just lost my brother but i pray to god to save my son

7666371 we think the energy business is going to go through an extraordinary transformation in the next couple of years
7666372 the firm has made this one of its highest priorities
7666373 alston amp bird will of course have the usual integration issues to align everyone on its higher financial metrics and goals and time will tell how this goes
7666374 we wouldnt do it if it didnt make financial sense
7666375 investing more time energy and thought into how to deal with the fact that gas costs 4 a gallon and theres global warming
7666376 that drives a lot of whats going on in the economy and we think there will be a lot more of that over the course of the next decade
7666377 if we are all the same essentially then at the core we need the same things
7666378 cheers to your blog for supporting healthy oceans and the alaskan brewing company
7666379 we want the womens center to lead not only in patient care but also in educating our community of doctors and medical professionals
7666380 with each wccc visit our patients see a variety of specialists based on their unique needs
7666381 bringing these doctors together to share their knowledge emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the prevention treatment and management of diseases related to the female patient
7666382 cher is nolans first choice to play catwoman he wants to her to portray her like a vamp in her twilight years

7666384 nice piece 5 yrs old belongs to my gf and she wants to sell it
7666385 hey honey what do you think about lending my 5 year old out for sex and i want to watch too
7666386 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7666387 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7666388 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7666389 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7666390 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7666391 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7666392 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7666393 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7666394 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7666395 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7666396 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7666397 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7666398 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7666399 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7666400 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7666401 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7666402 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7666403 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7666404 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7666405 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7666406 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7666407 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7666408 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7666409 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7666410 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7666411 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7666412 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7666413 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7666414 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7666415 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7666416 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7666417 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7666418 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7666419 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7666420 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7666421 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7666422 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7666423 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7666424 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7666425 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7666426 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7666427 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7666428 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7666429 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7666430 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7666431 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7666432 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7666433 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7666434 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7666435 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7666436 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7666437 good to see you but dont mingle with the clean folks
7666438 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7666439 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7666440 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7666441 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7666442 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7666443 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7666444 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7666445 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7666446 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7666447 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7666448 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7666449 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7666450 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7666451 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7666452 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7666453 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7666454 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7666455 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7666456 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7666457 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7666458 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7666459 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

7666463 its an exciting time to join ford of canada as we accelerate plans to introduce new fuel efficient vehicles especially small cars and crossovers which are exactly what canadian consumers are asking for
7666464 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7666465 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7666466 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7666467 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7666468 no one works for someone we all just work together
7666469 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7666470 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7666471 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7666472 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7666473 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
7666474 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
7666475 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
7666476 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7666477 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7666478 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7666479 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7666480 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7666481 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7666482 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7666483 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7666484 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7666485 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7666486 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7666487 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7666488 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7666489 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7666490 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7666491 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7666492 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7666493 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7666494 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7666495 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7666496 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7666497 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7666498 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7666499 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7666500 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7666501 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7666502 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7666503 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7666504 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7666505 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7666506 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7666507 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7666508 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7666509 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7666510 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7666511 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7666512 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7666513 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7666514 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7666515 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7666516 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7666517 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7666518 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7666519 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7666520 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7666521 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7666522 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7666523 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7666524 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7666525 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7666526 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7666527 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7666528 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7666529 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7666530 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7666531 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7666532 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7666533 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7666534 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7666535 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7666536 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7666537 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7666538 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7666539 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7666540 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7666541 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7666542 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7666543 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7666544 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7666545 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7666546 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7666547 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7666548 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7666549 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7666550 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7666551 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7666552 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

7666555 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7666556 this is a planning took where all things are going
7666557 and i think what were going to see as this process goes further
7666558 i think well see some revisions on the tax policies here
7666559 i f obamas plan prevails it could well be for the worse
7666560 while both candidates proposals have their pros and cons obamas appears to have a few too many cons theres no question about that if you happen to be in the top 1 of income tax payers according to the nonpartisan tax policy center the obama plan would boost the average tax bill for that group by 93 709 to 652 890 mccains plan would reduce that groups average by 48 862 to 510 319
7666561 raising taxes on the investor class simply doesnt help investment
7666562 the speaker lineup for tonight by the way here at the convention includes some of the partys most prominent and most liberal members including the house speaker nancy pelosi senator ted kennedy and former president jimmy carter
7666563 highlighting all these liberals tonight is that the way these democrats can reach out to moderates to independents and say you know what its time for a change
7666564 but this is a more liberal party it is a more liberal platform than we had with bill and hillary clinton its different this is not your big brothers democrat party

7666568 calling me an uncle tom is beyond the pale especially considering where he is close with mayor daley and with gov blagojevich i am hardly the uncle tom here

7666570 visitors to the gallery will have their chance to nominate their favourite portrait during the exhibition in the bathurst peoples choice award
7666571 its the greatest con we have to get away from it if you are designing a bottle thats really clever
7666572 its going to address what is going to be a major problem
7666573 it was definitely very good to hear what he had to say
7666574 all four were councillors on the previous council all four voted to close the bathurst saleyards
7666575 a lady came in and put the flyer down and said just a delivery and walked out
7666576 when i read it i wondered who it was from because there was no mention of who authorised it or printed it
7666577 personally i think those behind the flyer are the types who think daylight saving fades the curtains
7666578 everyone has to realise the saleyards issue is done and over i dont think its an election issue but obviously some people still do
7666579 if these people wanted to keep the bathurst saleyards open then why didnt they put up the money themselves
7666580 whoever is behind the flyer needs to take a long hard look at themself
7666581 its time to look forward not dwell on the past
7666582 at the time of the saleyards vote i made a decision based on what i thought was in the best interests of bathurst now and into the future
7666583 if that costs me votes then well and good but my integrity is not for sale
7666584 the council could never have afforded it much the same as it cant afford to buy the mount panorama resort
7666585 the fact that not one person could produce a business case showing the saleyards in bathurst could operate at a profit verifies this
7666586 it would have been millstone around councils neck had it spent 22 million on a facility it couldnt afford
7666587 we believe it makes sense for bathurst regional council in partnership with the community to take a fresh look at locally owned renewable energy options which would benefit not only the council but people and business
7666588 given the inevitable increase in energy costs from coal fired power stations communities across australia are now exploring the development of locally owned renewable energy options
7666589 the increases in energy costs are already being anticipated by a number of councils because of the high energy use associated with water and sewerage treatment plants the heating cooling and operation of a range of public facilities such as libraries museums art galleries entertainment visitor and aquatic centres council offices and the list goes on
7666590 the whole thing about climate change is the growing awareness people are interested to see what they can do
7666591 we are encouraging council to become a partner with the community and explore the options to develop a broader sustainability and environment action plan
7666592 it would be good if we could establish a network of thermal solar and wind energy throughout the central west
7666593 the amazing thing about climate change is it has got great power to re energise community participation people are interested and want to have control were an organisation helping people make the links
7666594 no doubt the pressure over the next few days will be intense
7666595 if we lose control of the generation aspect we lose control of our ability to meet the demand for electricity into the future
7666596 electricity is critical to the economy its ridiculous to think of throwing it into the open market
7666597 i think we should hang onto the retail market but i know that controlling generation is essential
7666598 concerned about someone googling someones name and being able to access it later
7666599 its not his food thats got me all hot and bothered

7666604 they came to us as undrafted free agents spent some time on the practice squad and earned their way to the 53 man roster by working extremely hard both have become productive players and were extremely excited to have them in the fold for years to come
7666605 its a special day and the path that i took makes it even more special
7666606 we took the tough road youre doubted and youre the underdog its so nice to know that the chargers value me enough to make it happen and im so happy to be in san diego for a long time
7666607 its crazy that it all worked out this way i couldnt have done any of this without my family and without the lord i just feel so blessed
7666608 the chargers are very progressive it can be viewed as a gamble but at the same time it can play out nicely for both parties it takes two sides to get a deal done and this came together quickly and smoothly
7666609 we identify from within and reward our own today we were able to take care of two young players that were very excited about

7666831 it means good living healthy body healthy mind and healthy spirit

7666851 el asesinato fue cometido en el marco de un ataque sistem tico a la poblaci n civil llevado a cabo por las organizaciones terroristas
7666852 el poder legislativo nacional resultar a responsable por cuanto el 26 de junio de 1973 amnisti a los guerrilleros sin desarmarlos suprimi la c mara federal en lo penal y la legislaci n antiterrorista dejando en libertad a algunos de los que secuestraron al militar
7666853 la estrategia de los ex guerrilleros estaba centrada en considerar prescriptos sus asesinatos secuestros y torturas por tratarse de delitos comunes realizados sin participaci n estatal
7666854 las cr nicas parlamentarias prueban que la clase pol tica contribuy a la tragedia sobreviniente calificando a quienes hab an sido condenados por hechos terroristas como perseguidos pol ticos que lucharon por la liberaci n y contra la dependencia
7666855 el desarrollo de las organizaciones guerrilleras en la argentina escapa a tipificaciones simplistas el erp prt no era una fuerza progresista sino una organizaci n revolucionaria que pretend a instaurar una sociedad marxista inspirada por el faro de la revoluci n cubana desde sus or genes consider que la v a pac fica al socialismo era una imposibilidad por lo que el cambio social s lo podr a llegar a trav s de una guerra revolucionaria
7666856 la violaci n de los derechos humanos de larrabure tuvo lugar en ocasi n de un conflicto armado conforme los lineamientos de la jurisprudencia internacional que en la causa milosevic ha explicado que el concepto de conflicto armado requiere nicamente que existan grupos armados organizados que sean capaces de librar combate y que de hecho lo hagan
7666857 sus ataques fueron sistem ticos pues estuvieron organizados de acuerdo con una pol tica y un plan n tidamente delineados

7666859 a los delitos de los terroristas las fuerzas armadas respondieron con un terrorismo infinitamente peor que el combatido porque desde el 24 de marzo de 1976 contaron con el poder o y la impunidad del estado absoluto secuestrando torturando y asesinando a miles de seres humanos
7666860 no podemos dejar de se alar que en varios pa ses del continente y en la argentina hab a guerrillas estas deber an haber sido contenidas a trav s de las leyes vigentes y dentro del marco del estado de derecho
7666861 nuestro pueblo sabe que los guerrilleros no torturan a sus enemigos
7666862 acostumbrado a torturar y fusilar a todo combatiente que caen en sus manos el ej rcito quiere justificar su miserable actitud atribuyendo falsamente a los revolucionarios los mismos m todos que l utiliza
7666863 la muerte de argentino del valla larrabure fue producida por asfixia por estrangulaci n
7666864 no surgen lesiones producidas por el paso de corriente el ctrica
7666865 fue hecho condicionado al resultado de la autopsia forense y de los ex menes complementarios que luego se requirieron habiendo actuado con escasos elementos para su examen con los antecedentes que se brindaron en ese momento
7666866 what are you doing that you have to pray 4 or 5 times a day to hope to see happen
7666867 a little surprised by the announcement and still sees himself as a starter
7666868 but i had some time to digest it and ill be ready to go grossman said monday in his first public comments since smith announced his decision last week
7666869 i havent worried about that because i dont control that grossman said
7666870 i feel like ive done a lot for this team over the last five years ive had some unfortunate things happen to me and some bad games but for the most part i feel like ive been a pretty good contributor to this organization
7666871 weve won a lot of games when ive played im proud of a lot of things ive done and im not paying attention to anyone or anything that will try to tell me otherwise
7666872 i felt like this was a great option for me to come back and start he said
7666873 it didnt happen but the seasons just around the corner im not anticipating anything happening but ive got to be ready because that moment could be the biggest moment of my career ive got to take off and be ready to go
7666874 its something i have to deal with right now but im going to make sure i do whatever i need to do
7666875 my personal goals havent changed my role in the immediate future has changed but my outlook hasnt changed at all
7666876 he talked to you all today so that says a lot you do need a little time when a decision like that is made but rex is a team player hes a professional he has a job hes a big part of what we like to do we have a lot of players in the role that rex is in right now
7666877 im not talking about medical stuff anymore said williams who had surgery recently
7666878 if sites were shops egullet would be selfridges a massive department store trying to cater to all tastes sometimes though i want a boutique operation top of these is dos hermanos the blog of the two half bengali half welsh majumdar brothers who eat out more than is strictly necessary and write very well about it

7666881 two guys who write reviews about mostly london restaurants they are a bit up their own arses but an interesting read anyways
7666882 i think that the imbecil that wrote this 1st don t understand anything about food
7666883 this agreement makes the sec the most widely distributed conference in the country
7666884 the bottom line here is that fans of sec football will have more access to games and better distribution than they ever have in the past
7666885 its not hard to figure why wed want to be involved with it given the quality of sec sports for 15 more years
7666886 one of the reasons that this league has developed into one of the top leagues in the country is because we have tremendous exposure
7666887 i think we had the best exposure from a tv standpoint in our last contract and this one is only going to enhance it more
7666888 our quarterbacks i have great confidence in all three of them to be honest with you and i cant tell you today wholl take the field first
7666889 i can tell you ill be comfortable with whoever that is
7666890 i would not be surprised if all three quarterbacks played at certain times
7666891 whatever the coach thinks is best we trust coach miles completely in our preparation
7666892 however hes going to handle it im sure will be best for the team and on an individual basis im just focusing on my job and working hard each day
7666893 and that is not to listen to me so much but i brought a special friend along with me today a great american success story as you know hes from puerto rico hes been married for 15 years he has children aged 14 12 and 10 one of his most famous songs i know youre very familiar with gasolina well here he is daddy yankee
7666894 it is a very special honor to be here this beautiful morning with everybody right here this is very special school it is a big pleasure that you guys invited me and thanks to senator mccain and i am here endorsing senator mccain because i believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation and like i said before he has been a fighter for the hispanic community and i know that for me personally i chose him as the best candidate because he has been a fighter for the immigration issue so for me he is the best guy to lead this nation and once again i want to say thank you to everybody for the support it has given me in my entire career this is a great honor sharing this beautiful morning with everybody i am a man of few words but with a lot of action like i always said
7666895 im just going to stay in my house and watch out for it

7666906 im just going to stay in my house and watch out for it
7666907 it only toughens our resolve to do an operation like this
7666908 the result of this operation thus far has been a huge blow to the enemys ability to plant major ieds and more to plant them along highway 1 in southern kandahar
7666909 its thrown them off balance and well continue to maintain the momentum to keep them off balance in that specific area
7666910 this is our last hurrah this is the battlegroups last push to clear pashmul
7666911 it is literally a massive reflection of how far the canadian army has come over the last few years
7666912 all these individuals have said they wont even attempt to make a claim for compensation because they will be found out by the taliban and they will be killed
7666913 this is a historically significant operation for this rotation and its effects are very important in the context of the campaign at this time
7666914 we dont need an illusion of partnership when they surround us by bases from all sides they drag more and more states into the north atlantic bloc and they tell us dont worry everythings fine of course we dont like that
7666915 its difficult to count them but they say they are deploying at least 20 at each checkpoint and two or three heavy armoured vehicles
7666916 we will focus on a concentrated international effort to help georgia to get rid of the russian forces
7666917 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7666918 alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia
7666919 we are hoping to resolve this situation peacefully and if that doesnt work out there are other methods
7666920 these people are considered dangerous and could possibly be armed so we are asking the public please do not approach them
7666921 the the one in b c is still a little bit controversial but it contributed to the death
7666922 of the 11 deaths in ontario six have been characterized as where the listeria bacteria has been an underlying or contributing factor in the death
7666923 five are still under investigation in terms of determining the extent of the contribution of the bacteria to the death of the individuals
7666924 this is an example of where our surveillance system worked

7666937 i think the road to the white house could very well come through the west
7666938 its probably not a blue state not a red state
7666939 it has to do with the fact i think that the democrats that have been elected are centrists that theyre pragmatic that theyre willing to tackle big issues
7666940 but also by a frustration with things that the conservatives made their mainstay guns and gays and abortion instead of education and transportation and issues like health care that really matter to people and are big issues and need tackling
7666941 people like us want to move to a beautiful area like steamboat
7666942 i think that may be the most important point about colorado and really the west is that theyll look to an individual for a message that resonates with them more than i think theyll look necessarily to their party
7666943 people who are registered as independents defaulted republican and they quit doing that

7666946 i want people to understand who we are as a family what our values are
7666947 i think the overall theme is that there really is more that unites us than divides us she says
7666948 and when you think about the values that have shaped our lives our story is the great american story of success and pulling yourself up and making lemonade out of lemons
7666949 i mean i joke because i dont like to be involved in the process stuff quite frankly i know barack i trust him implicitly he is smart he has good judgment and i knew that he would pick the best person to help him not win in november but to lead and i think he did an outstanding job in picking his running mate

7666955 although the overall number of people allowed to bid on the current landrush auctions is small demand for these vanity domains is quite high
7666956 translation higher prices for some of the domain names one things for sure me domain names are all the rage right now and are definitely here to stay
7666957 to the best of our knowledge there have never been more registrations handled in one day during the ordinary course of business by any registrar in history
7666958 most of the heated me bidding is likely to take place there is almost no doubt that many of the records set in the current virtual real estate rush will be broken again in a months time when many of the larger bids are expected to be placed

7666963 i am speaking out because i want others to feel that they are able to speak out and they can come out and say they are going to support a candidate who has the judgment and experience to make tough decisions during these most difficult times
7666964 she had the experience and judgment to be president now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain
7666965 i think hillary voters if theyre not already there are going to be there the difference between barack obama and john mccain are night and day
7666966 so with obama we have words with mccain we have deeds with obama we have rhetoric with mccain we have a record of accomplishment
7666967 this is why i believe that many many millions of moderate democrats and the vast majority of independent voters in this country will find in john mccain the kind of leader we need
7666968 i dont think hes had a very remarkable record as governor he focused mostly on easy issues and popular issues and this is a step up and im not sure hes as well prepared as others for this step up but its mccains choice to make
7666969 simply based on somebodys race religion or exercise of first amendment rights
7666970 we set it at 62 during the day and then i drop it down to 58 in the evenings put extra blankets on the bed joan is covered with a blanket during the day as she sits in her lift chair we dress warmer

7666974 the city was stricken with multiple illnesses of epidemic proportions typhoid fever smallpox scarlet fever measles tuberculosis and diphtheria were widespread
7666975 actually they cut through either klondike or they take nicholas over here to jump over to ontario

7666977 we put in place procedures for our bus companies so that they can get the kids back and forth safely through those neighborhoods
7666978 no word on 3 kids injured after fatal buggy cycle crash
7666979 the city was stricken with multiple illnesses of epidemic proportions typhoid fever smallpox scarlet fever measles tuberculosis and diphtheria were widespread
7666980 eventually we hope that hes the good player we think he is
7666981 the city was stricken with multiple illnesses of epidemic proportions typhoid fever smallpox scarlet fever measles tuberculosis and diphtheria were widespread
7666982 this is a case where everyone was so enamored and felt so much sympathy for the holocaust survivor it just overwhelmed everyone in the case including the jury
7666983 now to find out that the book was not true that is fraud on the court
7666984 this credibility issue is something jane is digging up now
7666985 thats not what the trial was about it was about the fact that she cheated us
7666986 she said the reason she was so attached to dogs is because she had been so attached to wolves
7666987 this story is mine it is not actually reality but my reality my way of surviving
7666988 from the outset she breached her contract but nobody knew it until much later
7666989 i think she went along thinking she had a blockbuster and she didnt want to hear anything about it not possibly being true
7666990 she always maintained that this was truth as she recalled it and i trusted that that was the case
7666991 if you read a lot of holocaust literature all survivor stories are miraculous
7666992 seeing kids in iron lungs was a real impetus in working toward helping control the virus
7666993 for all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7666994 we had some growing pains then and were going to need some help now
7666995 we can simplify what they do back there much easier
7666996 i found this footage of you playing fuck yeah fest 2006 and you looked so young

7666999 you have to be here to see it its just like a little magic carpet ride its like entering another world
7667000 there was a tv special on it the pageant i dont know how long ago but i was very much interested in it
7667001 so i know kind of what im about to see but i know that the tv couldnt capture what it is
7667002 we have seen a great increase in the demand for this program
7667003 it is costing us about 2 000 00 per month and we would welcome support from the community to help us keep it going
7667004 people are delighted to see us they want to care for their animals and this makes it possible for them to do so
7667005 we fully expect that both the number of suspected and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be tested
7667006 it wasnt a liquid market particularly as its the last week of the northern summer
7667007 its difficult to put a story around the price action in the last 12 hours
7667008 the notion that a casino can acquire public lands without even paying a single cent to the commonwealth is offensive to both good public policy and common sense
7667009 the city can effectively block any expansion of the prpas harbor facilities by granting such licenses to other entities or refusing such licenses to the prpa the prpa a state created regional authority is placed in the untenable position of being subordinate to the city
7667010 what makes the decision so hard to understand is that in all precedence we are familiar with a license issued by a government entity to use government land is always revocable
7667011 the implication in the decision is that once a government entity grants a license to use public land the government cannot revoke it for any reason
7667012 it is a contradiction to say that the city has the authority vested in it to give the license but not take it away if that is really true then no one has the authority to protect the public interest
7667013 once again we are very pleased that the supreme court in a meticulous legal and factual analysis has validated a position which we and the prior city government always believed was correct while we certainly respect the dissenting justices we do not believe that their analysis is consistent with legislative history and rigorous legal analysis our clients are anxious to work with their neighbors put thousands of people to work and start generating the funds which the current administration already has in their future budgets we anticipate that the city will abide by this decision and follow its legal obligations to facilitate our project
7667014 i suspect the general assembly may have some reaction to this and the authority we apparently have been granted is likely to be fleeting
7667015 this is simply the court overstepping the intent and the spirit of the act and once again misinterpreting the powers given to it by the general assembly in its misguided quest to have gaming up at any cost
7667016 has he always had a fondness for cleaning and grocery shopping
7667017 nobody came over to say hello or to ask me about my day

7667022 to get him out of the way before the november elections
7667023 support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives
7667024 should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
7667025 above all for the salvation of that person the politician preventing him from committing a sacrilege
7667026 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
7667027 if they the opposition decide to be spoilers then we will seek to negotiate with the minor parties to make sure these essential budget bills are carried
7667028 if i was a giant id do whatever i could to get him out and have him back on my team
7667029 the guy still looks great hes a hell of a player i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7667030 he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind
7667031 he said he missed it but at the same time he said hes content and excited to go into the next phase of his life so i dont really look too strongly to that

7667043 is broad and detailed teaching on the foundations of our faith so that christians may understand and direct their lives by it
7667044 has neither the governments publicity apparatus nor the presidents popularity
7667045 the scenario is a complicated one for the president because if he makes comments denigrating or offending the church in any way he may hurt the feelings of believers
7667046 are the groups that oppose the constitution against it because it is a bad constitution or because they fear losing their privileges

7667193 he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind
7667194 he said he missed it but at the same time he said hes content and excited to go into the next phase of his life so i dont really look too strongly to that

7667274 a couple of his teammates in a fit of high spirits took a photo of him sitting on a toilet and in what they saw as a prank circulated this photo to other team members

7667276 all three swimmers are very remorseful and have apologised to team management for what was poor judgement on their part and accept the punishment handed down
7667277 its something that both swimming new zealand and the nzoc will have to address its not something that can be ignored
7667278 any time protocol isnt followed it has to be addressed they know that and well look at it in greater depth when we get home
7667279 we only have one rule in the olympic team that we respect one another

7667281 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7667282 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7667283 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7667284 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7667285 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it

7667288 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7667289 if they the opposition decide to be spoilers then we will seek to negotiate with the minor parties to make sure these essential budget bills are carried

7667349 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
7667350 why are people digging up this garbage that has absolutely no factual substance to it
7667351 we knew we had to bring in a high caliber actor to play the next villain after heaths joker so we got cher
7667352 whered you learn how to do the whorehouse shuffle like that
7667353 its characterized by a little grace note just before the backbeat
7667354 we played our own style of very high octane chicago style blues
7667355 very very aggressive super charged blues and i just never escaped it
7667356 but then the band lost a sense of swing and became more of a teutonic grind i liked it when it had a little bit of a lilt
7667357 were both acts that have taken the black american musical experience whether its blues jazz or funk and pulled it into a direction of our own
7667358 both bands have credibility with people who dont like that kind of music

7667367 the community for more than 20 years has called for the pool to have water in it again

7667373 it is important that we participate in the drill not only as a public safety agency but also as an employer because the impacts of this earthquake will reach far beyond what we have ever experienced in any other disaster in our state
7667374 when this earthquake happens probably in our lifetime it will be our katrina but if our citizens are prepared we can save countless lives and recover more quickly
7667375 so goes the dollar so goes the energy complex these days
7667376 the storm is trying to pull the market higher but its not getting much of a boost

7667378 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7667379 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7667380 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries

7667384 id hate to see what you do with a spear
7667385 it just started raining and it didnt want to stop
7667386 weve lost 50 percent of the crop we knew we were going to get a little rain but we didnt know we were going to get all this wind and rain together
7667387 if we dont dry out the cotton is going to be impacted a lot more than it is right now
7667388 it will not end the drought it will make a dent

7667392 provided an excellent opportunity for the mtsu art department students to experience the hands on process of sketching painting and the color mixing involved in a large commissioned project
7667393 the mural truly showcases emily and sarahs talent along with professor anfinsons vision with a modern sensibility that succeeds at reflecting the energy and art deco aesthetics of the jazz age
7667394 then he started running ads saying oh obamas just going to raise your taxes and hell lead to an economic disaster

7667402 about 150 000 can expect to get sick some very much so
7667403 most people maintain just the right amount of iron in their bodies
7667404 it takes a while for even an astute physician to detect
7667405 its interesting how different the presentation is from patient to patient its such a jumble and thats what puts a burden on the general practitioner
7667406 were tying to get an iron test put in there so we can get at iron loading
7667407 ninety percent of the iron absorbed will go to the liver
7667408 if a person comes in and cant open their fist thats referred to as iron fist
7667409 heres a person who was able to tuck away the iron without it causing destruction of the organs
7667410 and yet there are other people who cant handle it
7667411 when you take blood out of the body iron stored in body tissue is used to make new blood

7667413 not just about themselves but about the direction of the country as a whole and theyve got good reason to be worried the fact is the economy is not working for ordinary americans
7667414 when you say the fundamentals of the economy are sound and your top economic adviser is saying youve become a nation of whiners then you dont get it
7667415 youre out of touch and youre not hearing the stories of ordinary americans who are working hard everyday but feel like their just treading water and in some cases sinking
7667416 john mccain has a compelling biography he served america with bravery and distinction and he deserves respect for that
7667417 but his policies dont deserve respect his ideas dont deserve respect because theyre the same old ideas weve seen out of george bush for the past eight years
7667418 the most important issues for me are affordable health care and getting out of the war
7667419 it is just to let people know there are people in town who like sen mccain
7667420 eu quero que voc coopere com a vida do planeta
7667421 we have already started to adapt our operations to best suit the fast moving and challenging conditions the business is facing

7667437 there is no way in the world that i as a democrat would ever agree to drilling offshore and im hoping i can convey that to all the democrats in north carolina
7667438 we do not need our coastlines littered with oil droppings
7667439 i dont have a problem with offshore drilling if they find out it is environmentally safe and it does not hurt the fishing industry especially in north carolina
7667440 we need a manhattan project or a moon type project so to speak its got to have a 10 year goal to put the united states back in control of our destiny we cant be in control of our destiny if the only thing we do is drill
7667441 one of the things we have to be careful about with offshore drilling is they call the north carolina coast the graveyard of the atlantic for a reason

7667447 dear bella what is your advice for dating when youve got an embarrassing car
7667448 if your date doesnt like your car you can hire a pony girls like that or you can go to your parents house when theyre sleeping and steal their car parents usually go to bed early and dont need a car unless one of them has a heart attack if i were you id pick her up in the embarrassing car if she complained id give her money for a cab and tell her she could follow me or go home
7667449 the loss of the kotuku was a tragedy and our sincere sympathies go to all the whanau families and friends of all of those who were lost we thank them for their courage and their help in assisting us during what has been a long and difficult process for all involved we now hope that the release of the report now brings some measure of closure
7667450 among the evidence collected by mnz were tests of the recovered vessel by an independent maritime expert who found the kotuku was seaworthy and compliant with all stability requirements prior to her loss
7667451 this latest evidence needs to be considered in light of two separate tests conducted by the transport accident investigation commission taic which each reached different conclusions and which the commission itself accepted could therefore not be relied upon
7667452 mnz believes the inconsistency of the results reflects the difficulty experienced by both authorities in assessing the seaworthiness of the vessel after the accident this was due to the kotuku being badly damaged after sinking and saturated after spending a week on the sea floor prior to it being transported via road and subjected to further tests while drying out in the open air
7667453 the point of any accident investigation by mnz is not to apportion blame but to learn from mistakes so that we can do things better in future to help prevent them from happening to anyone else
7667454 mnz is absolutely committed to a safe maritime sector which relies on all participants in the system doing their part

7667478 she was chain smoking and enjoying a glass of white wine which over the course of two hours was followed by at least five more her speech became more slurred with each drink and her head began falling onto taylors chest

7667483 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7667484 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame

7667504 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7667505 im getting a lot of calls and emails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7667506 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7667507 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7667508 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up

7667549 mr dion is essentially refusing to meet and not only refusing to meet refusing to speak by phone
7667550 this is a sign that hes for all intents and purposes broken off communication with the prime minister
7667551 sending canadians into a 400 million federal election wont be decided over the phone or a text message the issues facing canadians are too important
7667552 hes certainly not going to give harper a blank cheque
7667553 in the age of modern communication if somebodys saying they cant find a way to talk to you with cell phones and telephones and the fact that they live in the same city only a handful of blocks apart etc i think youre getting an answer
7667554 the amount of work a user must invest in order to find favorable videos in youtube or other video applications is overwhelming
7667555 this is certainly an application that can seriously increase the time on site metric for facebook if they can get a strong userbase

7667574 the stuff that offends me what bothers me is standard female music which is basically acoustic pop that i find quite irritating because it doesnt seem to be doing anyone any favours it perpetuates the idea that women are not as good at music as men because a lot of it melds into one theres so much average crap out there that it can get a bit depressing
7667575 at the recent live at the wireless gig while we were setting up all these little kids are up the front and these girls are like lets sit down and the other one goes why are we sitting down and her friend looks at me and goes well were not going to listen to this obviously thinking chick vocalist
7667576 were our own worst enemies we really are its a battle against ourselves it was really funny then we cranked up our loudest song at the start and they stood up pretty quick i just thought it was really fucking funny because i would have probably been that kid when i was their age
7667577 weve got one song on a foxtel series about high class hookers its called satisfaction and the song theyve used is howl and moan i believe the scene is where one of the prostitutes is walking up to a room and waiting for her customer if only they knew what the song was about
7667578 its been interesting to see how people react to the music because i went through a period where i absolutely hated the album and you just cant you have to let it go because were so different to it how we are now i feel a bit embarrassed about it sometimes
7667579 ive always liked his stuff its a slice of australiana without the cringe factor or in fact it plays up on the cringe factor ive got to sing a duet with the lead actor called in spite of ourselves its a pretty funny country song its so daggy that its actually kinda good the other one is a cover of a hunters and collectors song called stuck on you which i think will be really good to sing so im going to sydney this week to record that
7667580 im a terrible actor im quite wooden and just not a good actor far too self aware to let go and just do it its good to be aware of your limitations so you dont end up acting and making a noodle of yourself
7667581 i spend a lot of my time listening to the blues and also reading about it in an anthropological sense its something thats quite universal and older than anyone or anything they talk about it in this book ive been reading how the blues rose up from the ashes of when africans were cast into slavery and sent away in ships where they spent months and months on their way to america to live a life lower than animals
7667582 something positive something so strong within them was so resilient that it developed into the blues and i think that the potential for that exists in everybody so its a little bit mystical and a bit romantic i guess is my notion of it
7667583 i thought it would be a good excuse to get it out there i wanted to see if it was possible to recreate that kind of sing along style that you would have with lead bellys goodnight irene and sometimes depending on how drunk the crowd was we were able to achieve that
7667584 the rock and roll i play with the rockin pneumonia is quite heavily infused with the blues and i really enjoy that but since doing the blues shows with the devil alex archer of the kill devil hills and todd picket theres just been something that has been re awoken
7667585 the same as any other sheep only more so a little hungrier a little faster a little greedier a bellwether doesnt even know its leading

7667591 the mysterious death of former deputy white house counsel vince foster
7667592 did a close friend of hillary clinton commit suicide or was it a massive cover up
7667593 vince foster got in his car and drove to fort marcy park in virginia and he supposedly walked through the woods and depending on which version of the story you believe he took his own life
7667594 there are still many chapters remaining open from her hillary clintons time at the rose law firm take whitewater and the death of vince foster
7667595 t onight we travel back in time to the early 70s and based on reporting from new york sun reporter josh gerstein we take a rare look at hillary clintons affiliation with a group of radicals more than three decades ago
7667596 much more of a classic liberal than the rest of us
7667597 all year long publications like the new york times washington post time and newsweek have all reported what they call republican presidential candidate rudy giulianis temper well the subjectiveness aside couldnt the same questions be asked about senator hillary rodham clinton
7667598 i think she does i think she has a temper as do many politicians and rudy giuliani your favorite has a temper as do many people
7667599 i think youve got to keep it in the context of what she does and who she is and im just telling you first of all i do have to say that while there are people who say that she has a bad temper she had almost no turnover on her staff in the white house so that says something
7667600 no i know a lot of them and they like her
7667601 to reject the idea of an on your own society and to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity
7667602 this isnt the first time hillary has made her socialist views and intentions so apparent
7667603 there is no greater force for economic growth than free markets but markets work best with rules that promote our values protect our workers and give all people a chance to succeed

7667614 the black population is staying about the same and the white and asian populations are declining theyre not replacing themselves so the population is growing more diverse
7667615 what that shows is that women are finishing their degrees and having a baby right away

7667636 it has become customary to classify views on the relation of christianity to the world religions as either pluralist exclusivist or inclusivist my position is exclusivist in the sense that it affirms the unique truth of the revelation in jesus christ but is not exclusivist in the sense of denying the possibility of salvation of the non christian it is inclusivist in the sense it refuses to limit the saving grace of god to the members of the christian church but is rejects individualism which regards the non christian religions as vehicles of salvation it is pluralist in the sense of acknowledging the gracious work of god in the lives of all human beings but it rejects a pluralism which denies the uniqueness and decisiveness of what god has done in jesus christ

7667644 if the catcher is saying swing batter swing and the poor kid is swinging at everything he feels bad and may turn to the catcher and get mad
7667645 complained that theyd been chased and harassed against their will
7667646 just when we thought playgrounds were accident proof no more merry go rounds high slides jungle gyms seesaws or pretty much anything thats fun it turns out that safety itself can be dangerous
7667647 playgrounds should be designed with canopies how many burn cases will it take before before the city wakes up and acts
7667648 the harmful effects of our nations safety obsession ripple out into society one in six children in america is obese other studies show it is higher especially here in peoria according to the center for disease control this problem would basically cure itself if children were engaged in informal outdoor activities that used to be normal but how do we lure children off the sofa one key attraction is risk risk is fun at least the moderate risks that were common in prior generations america unfortunately is going in the opposite direction exercise in schools is carefully programmed when it exists at all running is banned at recess in many schools sliding into a base is banned in most little leagues sledding and high diving are banned kids are not learning how to manage risk
7667649 someone on behalf of society must be authorized to make choices between safety and the trad offs of risk courts must honor these decisions otherwise the pious accusations of safety fanatics empowered by the nearly universal fear of being sued will guarantee a cultural downwards toward the lowest common denominator a little common sense goes a long way
7667650 competitive sports and competetion in general shape a nations character unless we plan of course to go to war against an enemy who also values non competitive risk free self esteem building play activities for its young
7667651 nobody figured it out they thought it was all about winning states and not delegates that was penn he was always talking about national polls he was preoccupied with them
7667652 at one point we moved people to the feb 5 states
7667653 we were the earliest to staff up and open offices there and the first six states we staffed were caucus states that was a strategic decision
7667654 we decided we were going to be better at it
7667655 i am being very sincere would the clintons devote the time needed to court caucus voters we would
7667656 i talked to hillary in nevada a caucus state before an event and i thought venom was going to shoot from her mouth
7667657 she hated caucuses they underrepresented the working poor her supporters had jobs to go to they were waitresses and day care workers
7667658 the political and field operations were dysfunctional there was not enough staff the staff that existed was too junior and there was no plan there was no political or field plan on how to win the nomination
7667659 there were growing pains and they had to up the talent level of who was supervising these kids
7667660 it wasnt a happy campaign even when she was winning

7667672 computers like cats can operate crossdimensionally the trick is in getting them to do what you want
7667673 greece does not have folk music and it does not have folklore
7667674 folk music is by definition irish pop music specifically irish pop music influenced by eastern european dance music
7667675 rave and trance on technical grounds should be classified as classical
7667676 bluegrass is african american actually its origin is french just like rap but it has nothing to do with folk folk is irish pop music concocted in the 50s and 60s which uses instruments that werent invented until the 30s
7667677 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker

7667683 the nonsense screeds you compose and post to usenet lack any kind of coherent and rational meaning whatsoever and are composed of random bits and pieces stolen from mythology science fiction religion comic books etc placed into a blender and the switch turned to the highest setting about every other screed has droppings of death threats racial bigotry laughably false prophesies of gloom and doom and inane attempts to extort money these bland meaningless pulpy messes are then trowled into usenet identical or nearly identical screeds are repeated ad nauseum
7667684 q how many bush administration officials does it take to change a light bulb a none there is no need to change anything we made the right decision to stick with that light bulb people who say that it is burned out are giving aid and encouragement to the forces of darkness

7667686 we are most nearly ourselves when we achieve the seriousness of the child at play
7667687 and thats another mistake on your part your playing games on usenet and im not playing it has nothing to do with impressing you it has more to do with making sure you have the education youll need to debate the debate is no fun for me if you are mentally incapable of it im giving you an opportunity to educate yourself thats all
7667688 plenty of people post under their real names and do not attempt to hide

7667694 david has been round at toms house a lot while katie and victoria have been swapping fashion tips on the phone david has been advising tom on diet
7667695 tom has a private gym at his home and david has been working out with him he also gave him diet advice tom has been sticking to 1 200 calories a day mostly grilled chicken and fish with lots of vegetables salads and fruit
7667696 david put together a work out regime that included the treadmill weight training and fencing lessons together
7667697 tom had been steadily gaining weight he didnt notice it at first but then he developed quite a paunch he hated it when pictures started appearing of him with a belly and love handles he turned 46 this summer and hes got a 29 year old wife and a young family so he wanted to get back in shape
7667698 mischa and taylor were at a table on the patio with several friends
7667699 she was chain smoking and enjoying a glass of white wine which over the course of two hours was followed by at least five more her speech became more slurred with each drink and her head began falling onto taylors chest
7667700 at one point she tried to move from her chair to a nearby couch but stumbled headfirst into the couch taylor was mortified he snapped at her mischa come on youre making a fool of yourself people can see how drunk you are he demanded that she stop drinking but she only mumbled incoherently
7667701 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7667702 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7667703 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7667704 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7667705 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7667706 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7667707 they are in love and this news makes things even better
7667708 britney spears will not be performing at the vmas this year im telling you officially and unequivocally
7667709 is in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and was never supposed to perform at that show
7667710 tottered around the stage dancing tentatively and doing nothing that sounded or looked like real live singing
7667711 we were friends before we were a couple and were always going to be friends
7667712 we have two amazing kids together kevin is my boy
7667713 i hope she does it i hope she goes for it and kills it
7667714 britney was even asking how to work the thermometer to take his temperature
7667715 when kevin wouldnt take her calls britney started text messaging him and kept texting him for much of the night
7667716 he thinks hes famous as jen now last week he went to a party tipped off the paps and even had decoy cars at the ready when he was leaving
7667717 nice but no one bothered to follow them which made john think he lost everyone when really no one bothered to follow him
7667718 pictures of him and jen were selling for 20 000 at one point a picture of him alone gets 200 now chasing him from his apartment to nobu is hardly worth it
7667719 i would not be sitting here with three gold medals or any gold medals around my neck if there hadnt been a facility in edinburgh
7667720 its very short sighted but hopefully there can be some pressure put on them from the successes in beijing
7667721 obviously theres a new track being built for the 2014 commonwealth games in glasgow
7667722 but to demolish a track in edinburgh means theres a whole crop of young riders who are never going to get the chance to try out the sport
7667723 you know even just for fun not necessarily to go on to become an elite performer but just to enjoy the sport of cycling
7667724 we need support not just at an elite level but also facilities to encourage youngsters to take up sport
7667725 not just for the olympics but for the general well being of the nation
7667726 in terms of scotland becoming an olympic nation by itself i think there needs to be a lot more investment in sport up there in terms of facilities again
7667727 scotland should always be a stand alone nation at whatever i believe
7667728 i have been very proud to represent scotland at the commonwealth games and thats something i will always cherish and i will hopefully compete again in future years
7667729 give some shape to what moves them individually and as a couple
7667730 yea sounds like it you have a good day then
7667731 do you happen to know where i could find a vending machine i have a craving for chocolates now
7667732 well are you ok with a mars bar i have one
7667733 in gaza findet ein schleichender v lkermord statt von dem niemand notiz nimmt
7667734 you go to wrigley field you have a beer beautiful people up there
7667735 people arent watching the game its not serious white sox thats baseball
7667736 we got a lot of things we needed to learn from that game we did a lot of things well but there are a lot of things we know that we need to clean up to be successful in the regular season pre snap penalties the small details in the red zone you cant win just kicking field goals you have to really focus on getting touchdowns in the red zone thats the only way youre going to give yourself a great chance to win its always good when you win but we want to make sure were being very critical of ourselves to prepare for the regular season
7667737 were working we have a lot of work to do we really do im happy that weve been able to connect in the two games that weve played together i think hes got a lot of talent but at the same time weve got a long way to go to make sure we can play with consistency three quarters of football is not enough to say weve got it down yet we have to make sure we continue to work out here at practice and continue to talk to each other and always discuss things so we can really get on the same page
7667738 the one thing that ted has that you cant coach is speed when you take a guy with speed and then hes able to learn how to run routes and not just run fast youve got a deadly combination youve got a receiver who can really be successful in this league thats something thats very special he has the one ingredient that is hard to coach and you cant coach so now were trying to learn each other and really talk about these routes so he can become a good route runner
7667739 i think so i think right now we need to i think my goal for myself and for all of my teammates is to develop that consistency of habit not to have one practice where everything looks really good and then have one practice where everything looks really bad you want to be able to where every practice looks good knowing that youre going to make mistakes thats why you practice but at the same time you dont have those rollercoaster rides with practice
7667740 i dont think you can control that if i could control when the starter is going to be named i think it would be very important to go out and seize it as quickly as possible but when you dont control that decision you cannot focus on that you cannot focus on i need to seize that today this is the practice every practice is the practice every day is the day when the decision is made then the decision is made and you cant get caught up in the decision because i have no control on the decision making process
7667741 as a quarterback if youre goal is not to be the starter you dont need to be in this league because you dont have the competitive drive
7667742 i think the way weve handled it and the way coach runs practices everything is competitive and when he makes the decision then we need to act accordingly i dont think thats something that we need to worry about or even focus on i think its something if you do focus on it your mind is not in the right place and then what happens is you get caught up into that and forget about the little things that are going to lead you to your goal of being the starter
7667743 ive always been taught not to concentrate on the hypothetical that could really get you in trouble ive seen all kinds of different things happen in my nine years i really dont focus on it ive been in this situation before and i lean my experiences then this is my third time being in a quarterback competition so i lean on my experiences the past two times and let the chips fall
7667744 theres something that comes up every day in practice whether its a route a protection some type of footwork for the running back that i try to talk to a receiver ask him what hes looking at what hes thinking what kind of technique are we trying to attack here maybe its a protection talking to my offensive lineman what theyre seeing what their rule is or maybe its talking to a back on his footwork for a run play making sure that im not going too flat to cut him off where he cant see the backside cut those are the true details of football that creates wins if im too flat and i dont give ricky williams or ronnie brown the vision to see the backside cut we get four yards instead of ten yards those are the small details of an offense that are extremely important that dont show up in the statistics
7667745 if i was here in the spring id take the slow route but with me just being here two weeks and the opener being another two weeks away theres no time for being slow
7667746 so far im impressed im surprised that its ready im happy that its ready and things look pretty good
7667747 from what i can see so far its really clustered i dont think the kids are going to have great success trying to find out where they are especially in the eighth grade when they share the modular rooms out here with different classes
7667748 i think men are really scared when they dont know me
7667749 isnt getting dirty and fucking a mechanic right there in the garage every womans secret fantasy
7667750 what was i thinking about while i was taking these pictures
7667751 its really hard being a mountaineer fan living in pittsburgh so we want our boys to grow up having the mountaineer spirit so we thought wed bring them down for fun and festivities
7667752 its going to be an awesome season one way or the next i think were all really really excited about it i know personally i cant wait
7667753 i think well do very well coach stewart is a great guy and i wish him the best of luck
7667754 my boyfriend is always telling me im beautiful and sexy and stuff like that but hed better seeing as i give him sex
7667755 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them

7667758 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border
7667759 cbp is on heightened alert ever since we became aware of the threats in mexico
7667760 i would look for state specific items i would look for items that were put out by special interest groups
7667761 there were many many buttons made because the invention was new
7667762 you can pick up bryan buttons that are over 100 years old for 30 or you can pick them up for 3 000 plus
7667763 you push a button and his hand pops up so hes thumbing his nose
7667764 the air force has increased the sheer volume of pilots put through the training pipeline and shipped them off to war with the bare minimum training required
7667765 have come directly from basic training as their first exposure to the professional workforce
7667766 this is stuff we can correct through training stuff that happens between the ears
7667767 flight safety is of paramount importance to the air force and every mishap is carefully studied in order to mitigate future risk
7667768 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes
7667769 the whole week is going to be a do nothing week
7667770 the market doesnt dance with the same partner forever its all a matter of investors starting to look beyond the valley of all the problems to better times ahead

7667779 are you scared youll die during the delivery two weeks overdue
7667780 are you hoping for a boy so youll have a pair
7667781 based on the positive tenor of our recent discussions with idaan whereby it confirmed its intention to pay the contractual rate increases we are surprised by this action by the panamanian government
7667782 it remains our position that we will continue to abide by the contract and fulfill our responsibilities the panamanian government has an option to exercise early termination of the contract subject to the payment of compensation as provided for under the contract cascal maintains its position of abiding by and seeking enforcement of the terms of the contract

7667784 pero cambiando de tema me han dicho que hay una universidad en espa a en la que es obligatorio hablar en gallego
7667785 igual que es obligatorio en catalu a compartir el catal n con el castellano
7667786 pero no me compare el catal n con el gallego el catal n es un idioma importante con una literatura impresionante pero el gallego por qu ha de ser obligatorio en una universidad
7667787 realized that the russians were exploiting the ambiguous margins of the text and that there was a risk of a loss of credibility for the eu and the french presidency
7667788 sarkozy proved that he could act very fast and could also negotiate a deal
7667789 the criticisms which were heard among the europeans were that it was too vague and that he sarkozy was being sidelined by the russians
7667790 sarkozy now needs a consensus in order to continue to play his primary role
7667791 you cannot have the eu presidency france act in one way and other heads of state go in the opposite direction
7667792 i dont see the possibility of introducing sanctions against russia if the situation remains the way it is today
7667793 the eu doesnt want to make this link publicly but yes we are paying the price for our handling of kosovo
7667794 learnt of the high number of civilian deaths with consternation
7667795 suddenly there was the smell of burning flesh in the air and everyone was horrified to see the speaker begin to dissolve even as he spoke
7667796 i would not be sitting here with three gold medals or any gold medals around my neck if there hadnt been a facility in edinburgh
7667797 its very short sighted but hopefully there can be some pressure put on them from the successes in beijing
7667798 obviously theres a new track being built for the 2014 commonwealth games in glasgow

7667806 im in the marine corps i just came back from iraq in april and figured this is a good option little rock is a good department to work for
7667807 we are looking for qualified police officers we are actively recruiting we are down we need them very badly
7667808 anytime we are down officers it affects response times there are 21 open positions but it does affect response times
7667809 we dont have an option to say we wont fill that job today we just fill it with overtime but it puts a strain on our budget
7667810 training was good it was up to par i am anxious to get out and get on the streets
7667811 esse rbitro uma m safado voltou para o segundo tempo mal intencionado voc s s o todos uns sem vergonha
7667812 it is good practice to argue with a friend and take a position with which you do not agree
7667813 mr churchil if you were my husband i would put poison in your coffee
7667814 madam if i was your husband i would gladly drink it
7667815 mr churchil if you were my husband i would put poison in your coffee
7667816 madam if i was your husband i would gladly drink it
7667817 on the keyboard of life always keep one finger on the escape key

7667824 average daily consumption among males was 17 cigarettes per day while female daily smokers averaged 13 7 in 2007
7667825 there are periods of time when we have up to 10 and 12 patients waiting in emergency to get access to an in patient bed but there is somebody in the in patient bed
7667826 the emergency department should be there to provide emergency care not to have patients who are waiting to be admitted
7667827 why isnt eastern health dealing with the shortage of acute beds instead of using people as pawns that they are moving around to deal with this acute shortage
7667828 our data do support the premise that risk factor profiles vary by breast cancer subtype and that hormonal risk factors have a greater impact on luminal type breast cancers than her 2 overexpressing or triple negative tumors
7667829 let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion
7667830 the government will introduce legislation that will punish criminals who commit violence against pregnant women but do so in a way that leaves no room for the introduction of fetal rights
7667831 weve heard the criticism from across the country including representatives from the medical community that mr epps bill could be interpreted as instilling fetal right
7667832 this bill will be very clear and straightforward and the bill will not be misinterpreted
7667833 it wasnt a liquid market particularly as its the last week of the northern summer
7667834 its difficult to put a story around the price action in the last 12 hours
7667835 not that he should have known the rules he did know
7667836 a unique technology that has not been applied successfully to an airplane
7667837 we fully expect that both the number of suspected and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be tested
7667838 if they the opposition decide to be spoilers then we will seek to negotiate with the minor parties to make sure these essential budget bills are carried
7667839 like most australian financial services companies our results for the last financial year were directly and indirectly impacted by external events
7667840 however underlying business performance and momentum was maintained and we are well placed to ride out any further deterioration in the market as well as take advantage of any improvement in the industry cycle
7667841 thats still a good performance in a deteriorating economic environment
7667842 were very comfortable at the moment with the underlying securities
7667843 its not to say were not watching them very closely though
7667844 certainly the majors have indicated that they would move their rates down
7667845 were not a price setter we usually follow so well follow appropriately
7667846 they obviously had a go at iag and they seem to have moved on from than
7667847 they recently bought pmi a mortgage insurer so i dont know what their strategy is with regards to acquisitions now
7667848 we wouldnt comment on market rumour but were quite confident that our business is performing strongly
7667849 the air force has increased the sheer volume of pilots put through the training pipeline and shipped them off to war with the bare minimum training required
7667850 have come directly from basic training as their first exposure to the professional workforce

7667853 just feed her some vegetables at lunchtime shes very fond of carrots and broccoli and healthy food like that
7667854 you must have used lots of energy climbing that tree
7667855 i bet youre ready for some fruit from your bag now

7668072 1st they could decide to only accept uk entries to european and world competitions 2nd the ioc is also a private club so what was your point
7668073 there should be no problem with a gb team with footballers representing the 4 nations but for the olympics only

7668078 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7668085 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7668086 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7668087 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7668088 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7668090 the fact is that we tend as democrats to concentrate on inner city and the problems there and not recognizing the problems in rural united states
7668091 we have ignored them too long as a democratic party and maybe the nation as a whole i would guess

7668093 he needs a poke in the ribs and i am going to poke him
7668094 it isnt for either of our candidates they have dealt with the big broad issues they are in the metro areas they deal more with metro areas and metro problems
7668095 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7668096 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7668097 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7668101 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7668102 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

7668107 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
7668108 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
7668109 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
7668110 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

7668122 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7668123 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7668124 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7668125 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia

7668136 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional

7668138 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

7668145 great police work in solving this case and its really a shame that somebody like ms waite would use this terrible crime where these women have suffered greatly for political traction
7668146 for him to even imply that its about an election when ive been involved in rape crisis and spouse abuse for 20 years i got funding for pasco and hernando county spouse abuse centers and rape crisis centers
7668147 ms waite has done nothing to build a detention center here in this area to detain people suspected of being in the country illegally
7668148 county jails cant hold all these people theres at least 7 000 in our jail a year minimum

7668157 which actually is more or less the basis for any bristly brush engine
7668158 when i showed up here a young guy with a lot of energy and no gray hair i approached problems like and engineer this is the problem and this is what needs to be done so lets figure out how to do it and get on with it it has taken a long time to understand dignity people matter people are all that matter when you give someone something they have to give you something back there is no such thing as a free lunch a person who doesnt have anything to give back ends up giving you a piece of their dignity or self esteem you have to be very careful giving things out to people unless it is someone you have built a relationship with all these deals where people come to places like haiti and want to give out food or clothes or money or whatever to people who really are in need or appear to be arent really giving anyone anything they are purchasing the dignity and self esteem of people who might not have it to spare people that have been trying hard and maybe had some bad breaks dont always have a lot of options they have to take what is offered but in the end they end up hating themselves or the people giving things to them when you are in a place like this where people are poor and you are doing projects and have some money in your pocket you have to be very careful you are here as a guest and to help people get on their feet and do it themselves many have been beaten down and convinced that there is no hope for them or for their country a little encouragement and helping people help themselves goes a long way if you really do a good job of helping people help themselves it might escape them that you helped somewhere along the way if you are living for the buzz of having someone bow and scrape in appreciation and thanks you might be disappointed if that is what you are in it for every individual is made in the image of god some around here havent heard that one yet and need to be told and that they are valuable important and capable of doing something so valuable in fact that god sent his only son to die for them you do everything that you can to build people up anyhow now you know how it is these beautiful people created in the image of god eating dirt cookies

7668194 look unto me in every thought doubt not fear not
7668195 mmm direi che lo posso descrivere come un vomito di chitarre ipnotiche filtrate attraverso una lente che sta per svenire

7668198 thecheappop com is a terrific site for pop culture news with lots of original material all written with wit and good nature its been running strong since october 2005 in web terms a near miracle of staying power
7668199 i would look for state specific items i would look for items that were put out by special interest groups
7668200 there were many many buttons made because the invention was new
7668201 you can pick up bryan buttons that are over 100 years old for 30 or you can pick them up for 3 000 plus
7668202 you push a button and his hand pops up so hes thumbing his nose
7668203 ive talked to the mccain campaign a little bit about the issue but certainly not about me being in that mix
7668204 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7668205 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7668206 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7668207 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7668208 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7668209 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7668210 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7668211 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7668212 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7668213 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7668214 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7668215 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7668216 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7668217 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7668218 neither one of them can win but both of them can make the other lose
7668219 i just dont see how theres going to be any stand down by either one of them thats going to turn the campaign in another direction
7668220 when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember
7668221 now hes a convicted felon facing jail thats a housing problem
7668222 were not going to shy away from making the contrast people are making a choice we need to make clear what that choice is
7668223 were going to do it in a constructive way but were going to lay it out very very clearly
7668224 die antwort war eine frechheit das waren die worte eines politikers sonst n ichts
7668225 for all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die

7668227 est un film gros budget et ce nest pas le premier de durst
7668228 were the generation we cant afford to wait the future started yesterday and were already late
7668229 i was holding the medal for three days to make sure its not a dream its real
7668230 when the sage leads the people to victory they say we did it ourselves
7668231 the same thing weve been hearing from hillary clinton for the past couple of months which is that she supports senator obama as we all do
7668232 we are going to move forward united to change the team thats in the white house
7668233 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7668234 john mccain has a compelling biography he served america with bravery and distinction and he deserves a respect for that but his policies dont deserve respect
7668235 his ideas dont deserve respect because theyre the same old ideas that weve seen out of george bush for the last eight years
7668236 again though i ask what do we do with these men and yes women who have served what

7668252 ik werd mij bewust hoe fragiel beschavingen zijn toen ik mij eind jaren tachtig voorbereidde op het schrijven van het boek stolen continents over de verovering van amerika door blanke europeanen hele indiaanse beschavingen die zich in isolement van de rest van de wereld hadden ontwikkeld en die bijna hetzelfde niveau hadden bereikt als die van de oude wereld stortten plotseling ineen die gebeurtenis riep bij mij de vraag op hoe kwetsbaar onze eigen beschaving is voor een onvoorziene ramp de milieuvernietiging of de klimaatverandering zou een even verwoestende of misschien zelfs ergere impact op ons kunnen hebben als die botsing van twee werelden na 1492 op de indianen had de monumentale ru nes in het oerwoud van midden amerika laten zien hoe machtig en briljant die mensen waren maar tegelijkertijd zijn ze de grafstenen van samenlevingen die op een of andere manier faalden toen ik door het verlaten tikal liep de oude hoofdstad van het maya rijk op yucatan vroeg ik me onwillekeurig af hoe bijvoorbeeld londen er als ru ne uit zou zien geen al te wonderlijke gedachte nu de gemiddelde temperatuur op aarde catastrofaal begint op te lopen en laagliggende gebieden zoals zuidoost engeland en holland weer in moerassen kunnen veranderen

7668258 als ouder wat zou u graag willen dat uw kinderen zouden leren
7668259 te leren dat ze niemand kunnen leren of dwingen om van hen te houden wat ze kunnen doen is zich door anderen laten liefhebben te leren dat wat het meest waardevol is in hun leven niet is wat ze hebben maar wie ze hebben in hun leven te leren dat het niet goed is om jezelf met anderen te vergelijken iedereen wordt individueel beoordeeld op wat zij gedaan hebben niet in vergelijking met anderen te leren dat een rijk persoon niet diegene is die het meeste heeft maar diegene is die het minste nodig heeft te leren dat het maar een paar seconden duurt om een grote wond te openen in diegene die we liefhebben en dat het vele jaren duurt om dat te genezen te leren om te vergeven door vergeving toe te passen te leren dat er mensen zijn die zielsveel van hen houden zonder dat ze in staat zijn om dat te uiten of te laten zien te leren dat je met geld alles kunt kopen behalve geluk te leren dat twee mensen naar hetzelfde ding kunnen kijken en beiden iets anders zien te leren dat een echte vriend iemand is die alles van je weet en toch van je houdt te leren dat het niet altijd genoeg is om door anderen te worden vergeven maar dat ze zichzelf moeten vergeven

7668307 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7668308 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7668309 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions

7668341 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year one would hope that the conditions in credit markets should gradually start to improve and those two factors will help to ensure growth will start to pick up as we go through next year
7668342 charles beans comments highlight the fact that the british economy is to a large extent in freefall and theres not a great deal the government or the bank of england can do about it

7668434 after our first three students from the college made it to the btp last year the faculty took a special interest in us

7668436 his agency binder casting has contributed to the plays the lion king a chorus line grease and the list goes on they also cast the films chicago dreamgirls hairspray and many more after seeing and hearing shane taafua during a preliminary btp audition binder approached shane and said he wanted him to audition for a role in the king and i a classic musical that producers plan to revive on broadway next year
7668437 observing how they approach performance and apply creativity really gave me a fresh perspective
7668438 and i feel excited about learning all i can in this field

7668598 i dont think theres any question that russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia
7668599 theres no question that russia hasnt lived up to the cease fire agreement

7668601 this area is a maitland landmark where families like to come
7668602 so to find these things here is very upsetting for people and a great shame
7668603 parents alerted us to the kangaroo head on the bank and i stopped the train but i am afraid some of the children did see it
7668604 i was shocked myself the kangaroo head had been cut off and left there
7668605 a short time later we were taking kids on the train and we found about a dozen fish scattered along the track also with their heads missing
7668606 the kids said oh look at all the fish with no heads
7668607 maybe this was some stupid cult ritual who knows who you are dealing with here
7668608 i was scared at first but the two ambulance officers ken powter and john kovanovic were awesome
7668609 they gave us a lot of confidence and everything happened so quickly
7668610 at one stage the babys umbilical cord was around her neck but the ambulance officers quickly dealt with that
7668611 and our lovely daughter peyton was born without a hitch
7668612 the ambulance officers were thorough gentlemen and we cant thank them enough
7668613 we just want everyone to know what a good job ambulance officers do
7668614 we were only five minutes down the road when our patient went into full labour

7668627 the standard of roads is all about the amount of money spent on them and how efficiently it is spent
7668628 residents want to see a higher standard of road repairs with fewer premature failings more quality control and more accountability
7668629 they want to see less pot hole patching and more heavy permanent patching
7668630 the upgrading of our main roads has not kept pace with our increasing population
7668631 the council must continue to advocate as strongly as possible for the completion of major roads and traffic authority works such as the third hunter river crossing the f3 extension and improvements for better traffic flow on the new england highway

7668662 the attached print ad part of a series of similar ads run by glaxosmithkline is the most egregious example of this type of advertising this ad is designed to instill fear in the minds of aids patients by telling them that switching aids treatment presumably from gsk drugs may lead to increased side effects and potentially treatment failure this message is gsks response to the increased number of patients switching from its drugs to newer treatments and seeks to discourage aids patients from changing their antiretroviral arv regimens regardless of their medical needs further the explicit message in this ad avoid hidden dangers from switching your hiv medicine is that safety and efficacy information provided by a patients doctor or the fda is incorrect or misleading
7668663 the ads are part of a larger trend of drug companies taking aim at rival hiv drugs hinting at side effects and other drawbacks experts say
7668664 a development fueling the sharp elbows advertising the market for hiv medicines has grown crowded and companies want to protect their market share

7668668 we are disappointed that poz magazine a publication targeted to an hiv positive population would run such ads this kind of underhanded negative advertising creates fear of hiv treatment in general which could dissuade people from seeking treatment at all we are also disappointed that despite repeated communication with the fda regarding our concerns over a similar gsk ad campaign last year there appears to be a total lack of oversight of direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs that is why we are appealing to hhs in the hopes that our concerns will be heard and these harmful ads pulled
7668669 unfortunately gsks advertising tactics only serve to amplify fears and doubts patients may already have about antiretroviral therapy making it harder for doctors to treat them
7668670 it is important for patients and their providers to work together to make treatment decisions independent of drug industry advertising that might compromise the doctor patient relationship and potentially the health of the patient
7668671 he was scheduled to go in september i believe but he is now scheduled for february that will continue to be pushed off until the civil courts make their decision
7668672 if he is charged with a felony the commander will make the determination based on whether its incarceration how the judge looked at it all the factors will be considered he will be treated just like every other soldier in the army national guard
7668673 there was simply a genuine attempt to define himself and do something to support his family and something meaningful thats all it ever was
7668674 after working in the clinton administration in the on internet privacy and online commerce issues hunter consulted for five years as an expert on these very same issues at a time of enormous expansion in online banking
7668675 he was not a lobbyist for mbna and his work had absolutely nothing to do with the bankruptcy bill zero nothing
7668676 took plenty of knocks from the largest employer in his state because he demanded changes
7668677 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill
7668678 for all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7668679 i would look for state specific items i would look for items that were put out by special interest groups
7668680 there were many many buttons made because the invention was new
7668681 you can pick up bryan buttons that are over 100 years old for 30 or you can pick them up for 3 000 plus
7668682 you push a button and his hand pops up so hes thumbing his nose
7668683 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7668684 we still dont have a lot of answers about white house hopefuls who once vowed to run respectful positive campaigns
7668685 neither one of them can win but both of them can make the other lose
7668686 i just dont see how theres going to be any stand down by either one of them thats going to turn the campaign in another direction
7668687 when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember
7668688 now hes a convicted felon facing jail thats a housing problem
7668689 were not going to shy away from making the contrast people are making a choice we need to make clear what that choice is
7668690 were going to do it in a constructive way but were going to lay it out very very clearly
7668691 they still remember the price of gasoline was 1 80 a gallon when we put two oil guys in the
7668692 theyve been scratching their head and thinking well that didnt work out maybe we oughta elect somebody that has a comprehensive energy plan
7668693 i think people want change but theyre afraid of change
7668694 michelles speech will really focus on the obama family and will be a personal speech showing who she thinks barack is as a husband and a father and why she believes that he has the qualities that uniquely prepare him to be president of the united states
7668695 over the last week or 10 days john mccain has had a 12 and 0 run in the basketball game
7668696 these voters have complaints about both candidates that prevent them from making an endorsement theyve got hang ups about both of them
7668697 the people who actually have been involved in the conversations between senator clintons campaign and senator obamas have a very strong good cohesive working relationship
7668698 im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
7668699 people know that i can give the that i gave four years ago thats not the question on voters mind i think theyre much more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives
7668700 and so in that sense this is going to be a more workman like speech
7668701 theres not a liberal america and a conservative america theres the united states of america
7668702 theres not a black america and and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
7668703 you know 2004 i think was unique nobody knew who i was and i think even up to the time that i walked onto the stage and we had handed out obama signs people were thinking what is this
7668704 i dont think you can duplicate that kind of moment
7668705 it can also be inferred that kevin fischer has a distaste for pro life wisconsin types on yesterdays show he referred to people who objected to abortion for rape and incest victims as
7668706 and if being pro life means that kevin calls me a

7668713 orally instructed auditors to deviate from written policies by making determinations based primarily on the limited medical records available from equipment suppliers not the full medical records available from physicians
7668714 given its centrality to medicares financial oversight mission we are eager to adopt any meaningful changes to the program that will help enhance measurement efforts in particular and our overall program integrity efforts in general
7668715 i want to know what happened whos responsible who will be held accountable and what the human services secretary will do about it
7668716 if people cooked the books manipulated the methodology or told the contractor to ignore the rules those individuals need to take the heat
7668717 weve been trying to get at these fraudulent claims for a long time
7668718 cracking down on fraud should be a top priority for medicare not fixing numbers to make an agency look better
7668719 this is taxpayer money and must be treated with integrity and reverence i expect hearings and i expect answers truthful answers from medicare about this report
7668720 while we agree with the inspector general that the medical equipment error rate we reported should have been higher allegations of manipulation of this error rate are preposterous
7668721 im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
7668722 people know that i can give the kind of speech that i gave four years ago thats not the question on voters mind i think theyre much more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives
7668723 and so in that sense this is going to be a more workman like speech

7668727 i dont think you can duplicate that kind of moment
7668728 while this implies some stability in demand the headwinds of tighter lending standards and rising unemployment suggest that a recovery in home sales in 2008 remains a challenge
7668729 with the ongoing weakness in the eurozone we may see another push lower to revisit last weeks low
7668730 as of late the differences in the data between the us and the rest of the world seems to be leaning in the dollars favor and with the shifting global rate expectations the dollar may be poised for another broader rally
7668731 the us dollar has had a brisk recovery off its most recent low if the dollar rally is going to continue there has to be confidence that the backing of the currency is sound
7668732 constantly passing out funds to cover every distressed situation could weaken confidence in the dollar which quickly would be manifested in a rebound in energy prices as well as prices for many other commodities
7668733 the time is start ticking for the 2012 londodn olympic games

7668739 we just need to find the right spot to put one
7668740 it is something i really believe in as a parent and educator
7668741 where there is sufficient scope and severity of allegations we take action
7668742 he didnt do anything wrong he didnt hit this guy
7668743 he got him to a safe spot so he could have his seizure
7668744 on thursday one of his sisters came and picked him up and asked who hit him and he said my husband
7668745 thats the story hes sticking to now its not true
7668746 a couple of his teammates in a fit of high spirits took a photo of him sitting on a toilet and in what they saw as a prank circulated this photo to other team members
7668747 this was inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign for which the team members concerned have been suspended from the team
7668748 all three swimmers are very remorseful and have apologised to team management for what was poor judgement on their part and accept the punishment handed down
7668749 its something that both swimming new zealand and the nzoc will have to address its not something that can be ignored
7668750 any time protocol isnt followed it has to be addressed they know that and well look at it in greater depth when we get home
7668751 we only have one rule in the olympic team that we respect one another

7668792 technology has preempted that last argument we do need the jobs we do need the money we do need the oil

7668795 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7668796 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7668797 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget

7668807 the data suggests that although bankruptcies and credit card company losses decreased and credit card companies achieved record profits the cost to consumers of credit card debt actually increased in other words the 2005 bankruptcy reforms profited credit card companies at consumers expense

7668821 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
7668822 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

7668825 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing

7668828 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
7668829 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
7668830 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
7668831 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
7668832 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
7668833 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
7668834 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
7668835 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
7668836 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
7668837 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
7668838 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
7668839 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
7668840 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
7668841 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
7668842 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
7668843 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
7668844 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
7668845 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
7668846 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
7668847 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
7668848 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
7668849 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

7668851 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
7668852 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
7668853 as much as i hate to admit it all too often its english teachers like me as able and well intentioned as we may be who close down teen interest in reading
7668854 what ive seen teachers do is take living breathing works of art and transform them into dessicated lab specimens fit for dissection
7668855 why do we assume that every 15 year old who passes through sophomore english is an english major in the making
7668856 its simply not the case and the kids go elsewhere just as fast as they can anywhere but another book
7668857 your comment speaks directly to another major difficulty faced by high school teachers the one sized fits all book there are few of those you loved lord of the flies in 9th grade my daughter hated every page of it in the 8th another student is going to adore austen as a senior while probably her male counterpart would prefer to live without it its clear to me that to create in teens a love for reading which for me is a key goal of my work that we teachers need to individualize more allow pleasure into the classroom not at the expense of challenges thats the tricky part and give students the freedom to follow some of their tastes and preferences
7668858 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
7668859 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh

7668874 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
7668875 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
7668876 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
7668877 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
7668878 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

7668880 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
7668881 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
7668882 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
7668883 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
7668884 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
7668885 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
7668886 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
7668887 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
7668888 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
7668889 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
7668890 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

7668892 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
7668893 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
7668894 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
7668895 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
7668896 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
7668897 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
7668898 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
7668899 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
7668900 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
7668901 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
7668902 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
7668903 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
7668904 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
7668905 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
7668906 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
7668907 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
7668908 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

7669043 every day you see the devastation all around you a full 3 years after the hurricane and you wonder what you can do to make people aware of the situation here
7669044 i find it very frustrating that practically no one has even heard of st bernard parish which is adjacent to the well known lower ninth ward of new orleans yet this area was at the very epicenter of devastation from hurricane katrina
7669045 hurricane katrina has touched my life personally in a profound way
7669046 i left my home in new hampshire back in early 2006 to volunteer for 3 weeks and ended up making a 5 year commitment to helping with the recovery effort in st bernard parish in april 2006 i helped to establish the community center of st bernard so there would be a permanent location where local residents could receive help in what would obviously be a long and difficult struggle to rebuild
7669047 even three years later the devastation in st bernard parish remains overwhelming
7669048 entire blocks of homes and businesses are empty and derelict marked for destruction there are no hospitals in this parish now and the population is still only about 40 of what it was before the disaster yet the rate of child abuse in st bernard parish is up by 150 compared to pre katrina values and the rate of elder abuse and neglect has risen by an incredible 335 these are clear indications of the severe physical psychological and emotional trauma that the residents of st bernard have endured

7669118 prophet muhammad s said we are worthier of doubt than abraham when he said as in the holy quran and when ibrahim said my lord show me how thou givest life to the dead he said what and do you not believe he said yes but that my heart may be at ease 2 260 may allah swt have mercy upon lot as he recoursed to a strong support if i stayed in prison as long as yousuf joseph had stayed i would respond to the inviter
7669119 i believe in the power of giving life but i requested that in order to ease my heart when i would see how the dead could be alive again after the separation of its parts in the graves in the caves inside the stomachs of the beasts and in the sites of dying in the deserts or in the seas
7669120 if the blind between allah swt and me was removed i wouldnt be more sure than i am sure of allah swt
7669121 may allah swt have mercy upon lot as he resorted to a strong support
7669122 if i stayed in prison as long as yousuf joseph stayed i would respond to the inviter
7669123 the prophet said while ayyoub job was bathing in the sea nakedly gold locusts fell down over him
7669124 prophet muhammad said an ant pinched one of the prophets moses as said by at tarmithi
7669125 why did you burn one of the nations that praised allah swt because an ant had pinched you
7669126 i swear by allah swt if i had been given the seven states with all what was there under their skies to disobey allah swt by snatching a crust of a barely seed from an ant i would never do this worldly life for me is cheaper than a leaf in the mouth of a locust crunching it what had ali to do with a passing ease and a transient pleasure
7669127 no one is to torture with fire but allah swt
7669128 prophet muhammad offered one of the day prayers i think it was the asr prayer
7669129 prophet muhammad s led us in one of the day prayers either the dhuhr noon prayer or the asr afternoon prayer
7669130 while i was offering the dhuhr prayer with the prophet
7669131 prophet muhammad offered the prayer of dhuhr or asr in two rakahs and finished it by tasleem saying assalamu alaykum
7669132 the prophet ended the prayer after two rakahs instead of four
7669133 the prophet s led us in the dhuhr prayer or asr prayer etc
7669134 i heard abu hurayra saying prophet muhammad s led us in one of the day prayers either the dhuhr prayer or the asr prayer etc
7669135 the prophet led us in prayer metaphorically that he meant he led the muslims in prayer
7669136 while i was offering the dhuhr prayer with prophet muhammad s he ended the prayer after two rakas etc
7669137 prophet muhammad s said o allah swt muhammad is not but a human being he becomes angry like the other human beings i had a promise with you that you would not break it every believer i hurt abused cursed or whipped let it be expiation for his guilt and a cause for making him closer to you
7669138 i had not been sent by allah swt to be a curser but as mercy for people
7669139 the cursers will never be intercessors or witnesses in the day of resurrection
7669140 the best of you are those who are high minded
7669141 the prophet s wasnt impolite a curser or an abuser
7669142 ride to that valley and try to hear from him
7669143 i wrote down everything i heard from the prophet s in order to memorize it
7669144 do you write everything you hear from the prophet whereas he talks whether he is comfortable or angry
7669145 write down i swear by him in whose hand my soul is that nothing comes out of it his mouth but rightness
7669146 the real man is he who can control himself when becomes angry
7669147 he who has no kindness will be deprived of welfare
7669148 if kindness is added to a thing it will become beautiful and if it is deprived of a thing it will become ugly
7669149 the real muslim is he from whose tongue and hand people are in safe
7669150 permit him to come in curse be upon him and upon every one of his offspring except the believers 162 of them and what a few they will be they will be honourable in the worldly life and mean in the afterlife they are full of cunning and deceit they are given every thing in this life but they will have no share of good in the hereafter
7669151 if the family of abul aass becomes thirty men they will divide the wealth of the muslims among them make people slaves for them and distort the religion of allah swt according to their interests
7669152 if the umayyads become forty men they will make people as slaves take the wealth of the muslims as their properties and distort the quran to serve their interests
7669153 take out this gecko and the son of a gecko the cursed and the son of the cursed
7669154 the prophet s cursed the father of marwan and marwan was not yet born so marwan was included in the curse of allah swt
7669155 the prophet cursed al hakam marwans father and his sons
7669156 let the researcher for the truth know that i didnt mention in this chapter one third of what were narrated in this concern the first sedition in this umma was their umayyads sedition i couldnt end the book without mentioning them
7669157 the prophet s offered one of his prayers and said
7669158 what do you say about this quranic verse and if an interference of the shaitan should cause you mischief seek refuge in allah swt surely he is the hearing the knowing 41 36
7669159 allah swt the almighty had educated his beloved muhammad s with morals by which he preferred him to the entire universe that every prophet angel devil and human being submitted to his politeness and surrendered to his morals
7669160 o allah swt guide my people for they dont know the truth
7669161 we travelled in the night with the prophet s and slept at a late time
7669162 let every one lead his sumpter and move from here it is a place attended by the satan
7669163 take care of yourself it has to be cared by you
7669164 the satan ties three knots upon the nape of every one of you when he sleeps if he wakes up and mentions allah swt one knot will open if he makes wudu the second knot will open and if he offers the prayer the third knot will open then he will be active and in good spirits otherwise he will be lazy and in bad spirits
7669165 no prayer is heavier for the hypocrites than the prayers of fajr and isha if they know what these two prayers have they will come to offer them even creepingly i was about to order the caller of azthan to say the iqama 179 and then to order a man to lead people in prayer and i would take a torch to threaten with fire whoever didnt come to offer the prayer yet
7669166 among us was the prophet s reciting the holy book when the dawn began to send its rays he made us see the guidance after our blindness so our hearts faithed in him that whatever he said would happen he spent the night away from his bed while the others were in a deep sleep
7669167 o messenger of allah swt do you sleep before you offer the witr prayer
7669168 let every one of you lead his sumpter this is a place attended by the satan
7669169 then the prophet s asked for some water to do wudu he prostrated twice and then offered the morning prayer
7669170 prophet muhammad s offered the fajr prayer came in front of people and said
7669171 we believe in that me abu bakr and omar although they both are not here
7669172 you saved it from me who will save it if the lion comes one day to take it when there will be no keeper for it but me
7669173 we believe in this me abu bakr and omar although they both are not here
7669174 abu bakr sent me among a group of callers to mina 191 in the day of immolation to announce that no polytheist would be allowed to come to hajj and no one was to go around the kaaba nakedly after this year then the prophet s sent ali after us to inform of sura baraa ali announced with us to the people of mina in the day of immolation
7669175 i was among the delegation that the prophet s sent with ali to inform of sura of baraa
7669176 the prophet s ordered me to take the verses of baraa from you and to go to void the covenant of the polytheists 199 you are free to return to him or to go with me
7669177 you honored me with a thing i looked forward to it but when i went to do it you ordered to bring me back did allah swt reveal to you something about me
7669178 no but gabriel s told me from allah swt that no one would carry out my divine tasks save me or a man of my family ali is of mine and so he will do instead of me
7669179 the prophet s sent me with baraa to mecca to announce that no polytheist was to come to hajj after this year no one was to go around the kaaba nakedly no one would entered paradise save the believers whoever had a covenant with the prophet s it would be valid until its date and that allah swt and his apostle were acquitted from the polytheists
7669180 follow after abu bakr and let him come back to me take baraa from him and go to inform of it
7669181 nothing but good happened about you but i was ordered that no one was to carry out my divine tasks except me or a man of my family
7669182 when ten verses of baraa had been revealed to the prophet s he called for abu bakr and sent him to recite them for the people of mecca
7669183 o messenger of allah swt was anything revealed about me
7669184 no but gabriel told me that no one would inform of the revelation except me or a man of me
7669185 the prophet s sent baraa to the people of mecca with abu bakr then sent me after him and said to me
7669186 no but i was ordered that i would inform of it or one of my family
7669187 then the prophet s sent abu bakr with sura of at tawba baraa and sent ali after him to take it from him
7669188 no one will go with it save a man who is from me and i am from him
7669189 i was walking with omar somewhere in medina when he said to me
7669190 o amirul mumineen 205 give his right back to him
7669191 o ibn abbas i think they prevented him that the caliphate because they found him too young
7669192 i swear by allah swt that allah swt and his apostle didnt find him too young when they ordered him to take baraa from your companion
7669193 o amirul mumineen kill him and i will be the responsible for him
7669194 what can i say about him who owned the four qualities being entrusted with baraa the saying of the prophet s to him in the battle of tabouk the prophets s saying to the muslims
7669195 no one is to carry out my divine tasks save me and a man of my family
7669196 the prophet s sent baraa with abu bakr then he called for him and said
7669197 this is the house of the prophet s in the mosque and this is the house of ali once the prophet s sent abu bakr and omar
7669198 i am ali o abu bakr give me the book which is with you
7669199 nothing happened about you save good but it was revealed to me that no one was to carry out my divine tasks except me or a man of my family
7669200 go off allah swt will confirm your tongue and guide your heart
7669201 ali is from me and i am from ali no one is to carry out my tasks except me and ali
7669202 no one is to carry out my tasks except me and ali
7669203 ali is with the quran and the quran is with ali they never separate
7669204 mercy be upon ali o allah swt turn the rightness with ali wherever he turns
7669205 abu bakr sent me then he sent ali after us to announce with us
7669206 the prophet s said my heirs are not to divide a dinar of mine among them what i have left after taking away the spending of my wives and my employee is to be for charity
7669207 fatima the daughter of the prophet s sent to abu bakr asking him for her fathers heritage
7669208 the prophet s said we dont bequeath what we leave is to be for charity
7669209 did you turn your backs purposely to the book of allah swt who said
7669210 had allah swt specialized you with a verse of the quran and excluded my father are you more aware of the quran than my father and my cousin ali or you say those of two different religions are not to bequeath each other
7669211 or do you say that those of two different religions are not to bequeath each other
7669212 do you know that the prophet s had said we the prophets dont bequeath what we leave is to be for charity
7669213 the prophet muhammad s said to his uncle abu talib
7669214 i would say it to comfort you but i was afraid that quraysh would blame me and say that he did it because of impatience
7669215 the prophet s said to his uncle when he was dying
7669216 o people of quraysh i dont substitute for you near allah swt in the day of resurrection o family of abd manaf i dont substitute for you near allah swt o abbas i dont substitute for you near allah swt o safiyya i dont substitute for you near allah swt o fatima bint muhammad ask for anything of my wealth but i dont substitute for you near allah swt
7669217 who of you will support me to carry out my mission and be my brother vizier guardian heir and successor
7669218 this is my brother vizier guardian heir and successor you are to listen to him and to obey him
7669219 while the abyssinians were playing with their bayonets in front of the prophet s in the mosque omar entered and began to throw pebbles at them
7669220 the prophet s sent us in a delegation and said to us
7669221 i ordered you to burn those two men with fire but no one is to torture with fire save allah swt so when you find them kill them both
7669222 the prophet muhammad s said the holy quran was eased for prophet david he ordered his men to saddle his sumpter and he finished reciting the quran before they finished saddling the sumpter
7669223 this tradition confirmed that allah swt condensed time for whomever he will of his people as he condensed distance for them
7669224 some people recited all the quran four times in the night and four times in the day i had seen abut tahir in jerusalem in eight hundred and sixty seven of hijra and i had heard then that he recited all the quran more than ten times in the night and in the day sheikh of islam al burhan bin abu shareef told me that abut tahir had recited the quran fifteen times in a day and a night this is something that we cannot perceive except by referring it to the divine emanation
7669225 whoever was impure when it dawned he was not to fast
7669226 both of them said that the prophet s became impure in the morning without a wet dream 256 and he fasted
7669227 i ask you to go to abu hurayra to refute his saying
7669228 they knew more than me i heard that from al fadhl and didnt hear it from the prophet s
7669229 o messenger of allah swt our camels move on the sands like the antelopes but why do they when mix with a mangy camel become mangy
7669230 o allah swt dont let him die until he meets prostitutes
7669231 o allah swt dont make my son be like this bondwoman
7669232 that man on the sumpter was one of the tyrants but as for that bondwoman people said
7669233 the prophet muhammad s entrusted me with keeping the zakat of ramadan
7669234 by allah swt i will take you to the prophet s
7669235 he complained to me that he was in need and had hungry children i had pity for him and set him free
7669236 i am in need and have children let me go and i wont come back again
7669237 he complained to me that he was in need and had children i felt pity for him and set him free
7669238 he told you a lie he will come back again
7669239 let me teach you some words which allah swt will benefit you with when you go to bed recite the quranic verse al kursi you will be kept by an angel and the satan wont near you until the morning
7669240 do you know with whom you talked for the last three nights
7669241 i used to invite my mother to be a muslim when she was polytheist
7669242 my mother abused you please pray allah swt to guide her
7669243 i witness that there is no god but allah swt and that muhammad is his slave and messenger
7669244 be delighted allah swt responded to your pray he guided my mother
7669245 o messenger of allah swt pray allah swt to endear me and my mother to the believers and to endear them to us
7669246 o allah swt endear your this slave and his mother to the believers and endear the believers to them
7669247 the falsest of people or he said the falsest of the living people is abu hurayra ad doussi
7669248 o enemy of allah swt and enemy of his quran you stole the wealth of the muslims etc
7669249 you narrated too many traditions of the prophet s and i think you fabricated and told lies
7669250 you have to leave narrating traditions or i will expel you to the land of yemen or the land of monkeys
7669251 when i came from yemen to meet the prophet s in medina i said in the way
7669252 i set him free for the sake of allah swt
7669253 i swear by allah swt who there is no god but him i depended on my liver because of hunger i put a rock on my stomach etc
7669254 i often fainted between the minbar of the prophet s and the room of aaisha the comers put their feet on my neck thinking i was mad but it was no madness it was hunger
7669255 go and water the farm of that man it called him by name
7669256 i heard a voice in the cloud it ordered the cloud to rain over your farm and mentioned your name would you tell me what you do with your farm
7669257 i wait until my trees fruit then i give a third of the fruits as charity
7669258 o allah swt you know that i have borrowed one thousand dinars from that man he asked for a guarantor i said that allah swt was a sufficient guarantor and he agreed he asked for a witness i said that allah swt was a sufficient witness and he agreed i tried my best to find a ship to repay him his money but i could not now you are my depositee
7669259 a nice hue and a good skin people disliked me
7669260 i am a poor man i lost everything in my travel and i have no one to help me save allah swt and you i ask you by him who gave you the pretty hue the good skin and the wealth to give me a camel to carry me in my travel
7669261 i think i know you were you not leprous and poor and that people disliked you then allah swt provided you with all of these blessings
7669262 if you told a lie let allah swt return you to what you had been before
7669263 i am poor and a wayfarer i have nothing and there is no one to help me save allah swt and you i asked you by him who gave you back your sight to give me a ewe to benefit me in my travel
7669264 i was blind and allah swt gave me back my sight i was poor and allah swt made me rich you can take whatever you like by allah swt i wont prevent you from taking anything for the sake of allah swt
7669265 i tried you all allah swt became pleased with you but discontented with your two friends
7669266 a woman entered hell because of a cat she tied it she neither fed it nor let it feed on insects
7669267 the believer is more honorable near allah swt than to be tortured with fire because of a cat when you tell of the prophets s traditions think well how you will tell

7669505 the u s news rankings demonstrate that arizona state university is succeeding in its mission to be both accessible and excellent we have surprised our critics by both increasing the percentage of students we admit as well as our quality
7669506 others are taking notice of what we are doing and have chosen asu as one of the schools everyone should be watching for the way we are setting a new standard for the american university

7669509 the three warnings about serious adverse events associated with use of atypical antipsychotic agents in elderly people with dementia had a limited effect on the prescription rates of these agents
7669510 we also found that the overall rates of use of these drugs actually increased between the first warning in 2002 and the end of our follow up in 2007
7669511 this finding highlights the limited impact of warnings and suggests that more effective approaches are needed to protect vulnerable populations from potentially hazardous medications
7669512 health care warnings should provide accurate explicit and complete information about the risks and efficacy of the identified treatment in addition to providing the same information on alternative treatments
7669513 let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion
7669514 the government will introduce legislation that will punish criminals who commit violence against pregnant women but do so in a way that leaves no room for the introduction of fetal rights
7669515 weve heard the criticism from across the country including representatives from the medical community that mr epps bill could be interpreted as instilling fetal right
7669516 this bill will be very clear and straightforward and the bill will not be misinterpreted

7669520 im telling my story far and wide to anyone wholl listen because the poetry world is small and its hard enough to get your work seen and taken seriously because its supposed to work out if youre lucky enough to get that phone call and win that prize because poetry presses should be in this because they love poetry and want to produce quality books not because they have issues and poetic insecurities of their own and need to feel validated and in control im telling this story because once you sign a contract and give up your finalist position in other contests you shouldnt have to start over at square one all because an unethical press broke the law and its word and im telling you this because their new book award contest opens for submissions september 1st and i want every poet out there who is considering sending their manuscripts to reconsider your work deserves to be seen and placed in a press with ethics and integrity i know its tempting to just blanket the market and hope for the best but if you hit with this press it could happen to you too as both of the last two contest winners had to enter into legal action against this press and neither has a book to show for it the name of the press

7669522 its an exciting time to join ford of canada as we accelerate plans to introduce new fuel efficient vehicles especially small cars and crossovers which are exactly what canadian consumers are asking for
7669523 i look forward to working closely with the ford of canada dealers to ensure we are not only meeting but exceeding customer expectations as we introduce the new products
7669524 we think our service can be a step above what consumers enjoy today in the industry
7669525 we also know the dry cleaning industry is very large and its here to stay and we believe we can offer something for unmet needs
7669526 theyve got too much stuff on their plate and i dont think theyre going to get that involved in dry cleaning
7669527 financial stresses are still permeating global financial systems despite massive accommodation from the fed
7669528 we have an unwavering commitment to keeping your food safe with standards well beyond regulatory requirements but this week our best efforts failed and we are deeply sorry
7669529 tragically our products have been linked to illnesses and loss of life
7669530 theres no evidence of listeria contamination in our products beyond the production lines originally under investigation
7669531 i think that as theyve acted extremely responsibly after a short while the consumers will forget about it theyve got a very short memory
7669532 theyre a leading company in their field they produce good products and they have stepped into the breach when necessary so in six months everybody will have forgotten about it
7669533 maple leafs strategy is almost a textbook copy of what johnson amp johnson did
7669534 so if this is done well it can really mean that the brand doesnt have to suffer too much
7669535 what theyre doing is protecting the brand and its the brand that matters in the long term for maple leaf without the brand they dont have anything
7669536 so theyve been very very proactive about it unusually so because most companies that go through crises of this nature tend to hide its quite commendable from a business point of view
7669537 i think theres enough lawyers out there that like this kind of business that there will be lawsuits
7669538 they can recover a very high proportion of their business maybe 95 per cent 98 per cent theres only a few hardcore people who wont go back to eating roast beef but if they dont handle it properly then it can be a significant loss of business
7669539 the reality is that the risks are huge because youre not just looking at an isolated part of the business but youre looking at a risk to every product that has the maple leaf name on it
7669540 its going to take some time for them to recover from it no matter what they do but this kind of thing at least can help keep them in peoples minds as a company thats reasonably trustworthy and when there is a problem they face up to it and deal with it

7669551 one hundred and forty nine thousand head of cattle so youre looking at 1 040 trucks the equivalent of 22 triple road trains of livestock leaving the boulia shire every day
7669552 normal carrying capacity for the shire is 184 000 and the current stocking numbers are 35 000 its pretty devastating the numbers that have gone out
7669553 like properties that could carry 9 000 are down to 1 200 and then youve got the smaller operations that are totally de stocked you know theyll run 2 000 or 3 000 head they havent got a beast left on them

7669575 i am certain that the mayor will work to the end of his term in office
7669576 i love accessories and weve always used a lot of accessories so it was a natural thing for us to do
7669577 for the first collection i wanted to do a lot of things taken from the street one of the things i love to do is walk on the streets of new york or brooklyn and see what the kids are doing and that goes with our mantra catwalk meets sidewalk i saw a lot of filled hoops and charm bracelets thats what the kids are wearing these days
7669578 there are theories about hormonal differences but none has been proved
7669579 its important for quality of life reasons its consistent with who denver is as a community and its also an economic development niche
7669580 denver is proud of being a sustainable city and being increasingly recognized as such
7669581 theyre free we just ask people to bring an id and a credit card
7669582 we want to promote bike riding people getting well being healthy living a better life saving on gas benefiting the environment those are good things as well
7669583 its the most cost effective most convenient and its free
7669584 its a good gesture towards it when you look at the streets its still full of vehicles
7669585 im not riding in a taxi im not taking a bus im riding a bike
7669586 were trying to be environmentally conscious we carpooled up in the spirit of the convention
7669587 the best way to get people to want to try this stuff is to show them clean energy works
7669588 when the convention is running on clean renewable energy and the lights stay on thats a big aha for the american people
7669589 the whole world will be watching denver so any chance we get
7669590 nadie tiene dudas de que esta es la convenci n de barack obama
7669591 se sienten obligados con las personas que los enviaron aqu y que los eligieron para representarlas
7669592 que sea cual fuere la persona por la que decidan votar estaremos todos unidos tras el senador obama
7669593 no podemos permitir otros cuatro a os del mismo gobierno
7669594 les pido a ustedes que me han apoyado y a quienes siempre les estar agradecida que trabajen en favor de barack obama como lo han hecho por m
7669595 les pido unirnos en favor del pr ximo presidente de los estados unidos barack obama
7669596 pero por otro lado ella utiliza tambi n este momento para enviar otro mensaje esta semana todos tenemos que marchar al un sono
7669597 los retos que tenemos como naci n son m s grandes que barack obama o hillary clinton
7669598 obviamente no podemos permitir que contin en las pol ticas de fracaso del presidente george bush
7669599 tenemos que estar unidos y luchar para apoyar a barack obama
7669600 incluso antes de la convenci n e incluso antes de la total reconciliaci n que necesitamos
7669601 the deans secretary was back in about five minutes with a xerox copy of an ibm printout of terry orchards schedule

7669604 el gobierno viene aplicando decretos legislativos contrarios a los derechos que tenemos los trabajadores y el pueblo como es a expresarse a opinar a movilizarse
7669605 that never made sense to me even if bush was telling the truth about weapons of mass destruction in fact particularly if he was telling the truth about weapons of mass destruction why the hell would you bomb a country that could fire back that would be insane bush did real damage to americas reputation around the world
7669606 you cant have the government determining how long people are imprisoned for thats the job of the courts habeas corpus is a right that goes back to the magna carta and governments cant infringe upon that
7669607 im hillary clinton and i do not approve of that message
7669608 we just wanted to give him some rest to alleviate some of the pain
7669609 we are concerned about not burning options on a guy like jon niese
7669610 this is planetary destabilization and its already begun the question is how do we arrest this before it gets to the point of catastrophe
7669611 the earth could be free of arctic summer ice within our lifetime
7669612 this has not happened as far as we know in 130 000 years as long as human beings have existed on the planet
7669613 if you had a gauge in your car reading in the red zone how long would you feel comfortable driving down the highway like that thats where we are now
7669614 he said you dont understand were going to ban the sale of new automobiles in this country
7669615 if we were to move to the most efficient lighting technologies available today we could reduce electricity demand nationwide by 12 percent
7669616 on coal fired energy kutscher says energy efficiency alone can reduce u s energy use by 57 percent and beyond efficiency carbon emissions can be drastically reduced by generating vastly more energy from cleaner sources like the wind sun and earths heat we see 40 percent of the worlds electricity coming from wind
7669617 that would require building roughly a million and a half over the next dozen years now a million and a half may sound like a lot but we make 65 million cars a year
7669618 i mention that just to give a sense of how much renewable energy there is out there three states in the u s texas have enough energy capacity to power the whole country
7669619 from being a nation of energy consumers to being a nation of energy producers
7669620 wouldnt it be nice if you put solar panels on your house you got a check in the mail farmers in germany now have a new revenue stream
7669621 we have the solutions we just need to come up with the political will to get those technologies out there even faster
7669622 we believe in using nonviolent civil disobedience at times when its necessary to incite change it takes me to jail sometimes
7669623 as i look around the room i see some of the people ive been to jail with here today
7669624 we cant have half measures we dont have time to lose we have to hit the ground running
7669625 now is the time to speak the truth and bring new people into the political process well only do this from the bottom up if people way beyond
7669626 are we going to have the biggest political failure in the history of the world
7669627 are we going to create a human wave that knocks down the doors of congress and knocks down the doors of the
7669628 in retrospect we didnt capture any making of footage that wasnt fake so we could probably even do a third shoot for a real documentary
7669629 we were inspired by the endless dvd commentary on war movies
7669630 theres always this sort of arrogant attitude that movie making is a lot like war but youre not going to die and youre not killing anyone so by that definition alone its not like war
7669631 we could burn through an entire reel of the riffing definitely
7669632 i think a redux or a directors cut is in the works
7669633 verbal manifestations of human physicality in music poetry and religion are distilled to their basic elements
7669634 old school wired articles go read gadget lab or monkey bites
7669635 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
7669636 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
7669637 i recognize that some who do dna barcoding may be upset by this study but that is the nature of science
7669638 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal but we need to be careful to pay attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
7669639 we know from previous research that the uninsured have poor outcomes on a number of measures and they are less likely to seek care when they need it
7669640 but we know less about what actually happens when the uninsured try to obtain health care in various settings and more specifically how institutions deal with these patients
7669641 we found that the public institution was the most open to seeing patients in a variety of settings by contrast the for profit institution would really only see patients in the emergency department
7669642 the for profit basically took its losses and seemed to say well just see these folks in the emergency department we wont work too hard to get money from them and so be it
7669643 and not surprisingly the not for profit fell in between
7669644 as we move forward in the political process we have to recognize that this is essentially an unmanaged group a group of people who dont know what theyre going to get they are getting care from a set of institutions that are uncomfortable and unsure about what it is they want to provide
7669645 the american association of clinical endocrinologists aace is pleased to endorse the 1st world congress on interventional therapies for type 2 diabetes
7669646 aace recognizes the need for interventions that are proven to be safe and effective in the management of type 2 diabetes aace looks forward to participating in this very important scientific meeting which will critically examine the potential role for surgery in treating type 2 diabetes and other related metabolic disorders
7669647 i am excited about the collaboration between endocrinologists and surgeons
7669648 together along with other leading experts in diabetes and public health the congress will examine the emerging role of surgery not only as a therapy for type 2 diabetes but as a means to shed light on the causes of the disease the lessons we are already learning from studying gastrointestinal surgery have tremendous implications for the same future of medical therapies of diabetes
7669649 surgery has arrived like a comet across the firmament of diabetes and obesity unexpected brilliant with great promise for the future
7669650 teams of talented researchers are moving ahead to define the role of surgery in the treatment of both of these scourges
7669651 teasing out the agents responsible for the beneficial effects of gastrointestinal surgery on diabetes may lead to new discoveries and provide targets for new medications or even less invasive interventional therapies
7669652 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7669653 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7669654 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7669655 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7669656 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7669657 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7669658 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise
7669659 its not just the more mature reproductive women desiring fewer withdrawal bleeds
7669660 now thats becoming a more common desire among even younger women seeking hormonal contraception
7669661 the only difference recently is that we have these dedicated products
7669662 youre not pregnant youre supposed to have a period or dammit i had a period for 35 years youre going to have a period for 35 years
7669663 many failures with birth control pills occur when that seven day hormone free interval gets extended longer and women actually run the risk of ovulating if you forget to start your pack right when youre supposed to
7669664 america is not a class caste system but over eager capitalists are driving us towards one
7669665 we will do whatever is possible to bring the car to the united states that i promise
7669666 we need the support of the vw audi group and we need to overcome some legal hurdles regarding licensing but at the end of the day we want to see this vehicle on the streets of america

7669670 i just wanted to work hard and make sure it was an up tempo game
7669671 i just wanted to push a lot of the younger guys so they can show what they got
7669672 i just wanted to come here and work hard and try to get back into shape and help out the young guys as much as i could
7669673 i think they know who the older guys might be and they just try to follow our example
7669674 but they had a good team and we didnt really get much going we probably need to dump puck in a little more and try to keep it simple
7669675 were in a bit of a tough situation where camp ends here tonight and weve got almost a two week layover until we get into some preseason games
7669676 theres going to be an opportunity now for us to carry a few extra bodies to go through some practices and allow our coaching staff to start implementing systems and see how quickly these kids can respond pick it up and absorb it
7669677 i think theres a number of different scenarios we have to look at
7669678 a lot of the decision process that were going to go through revolves around how many games we think todd can play for us
7669679 i had to go with the mindset this summer that i knew i had to get this position
7669680 i knew i had to work hard for it and i knew i was going to be pushed by some of the younger goaltenders here
