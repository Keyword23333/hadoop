3980000 mentally i wasnt there they had a short leash and thats just how it works in this business
3980001 i dont know my head was just not in it at that point
3980002 i came back from the gym and heard wilkins had retired
3980003 i was like oh cool i told my mom i might have a good shot just because i knew that there werent that many kickers on the market
3980004 but once josh came around i was like you know what
3980005 one day i hope i can say you bought a guy for 14 million when you couldve gotten me for free well see what happens
3980006 thats kind of what sparked interest for me at a young age to go to fresno state
3980007 i followed his footsteps to go there its kind of ironic that i ended up in st louis with him here
3980008 the last time i saw him it was at a funeral last year
3980009 was productive i guess i wasnt that fast of a guy i was kind of upset but youve got to roll with the punches and just keep moving
3980010 then the rams called after they found out that green bay didnt sign me
3980011 ive heard a lot of good things from the coaches
3980012 they like my running style definitely they like my attributes low center of gravity big legged guy like to bull it up in there and run hard
3980013 you see guys like torry holt marc bulger on tv and youre like man it must be crazy to play in the nfl
3980014 but once you get out here get moving with the guys get acclimated its just like college a little bit faster but its just like college
3980015 its physically and mentally straining but im just trying to settle in and enjoy it
3980016 show them i can make plays in pressure situations and be reliable and accountable
3980017 who choose to abort an unwanted pregnancy may experience feelings of grief and loss but there is no evidence that a single abortion causes significant mental health problems
3980018 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
3980019 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
3980020 if you look at our contract it clearly states that the board of education and hsta shall work on the implementation of this and thats what we have been doing weve been negotiating with the board of education
3980021 its 33 pages long its quite detailed and were ready to implement it today
3980022 and that will impact all 13 000 teachers across the state
3980023 theyve made it very very clear they have no intention of negotiating over procedures for random drug testing
3980024 we know aclu is waiting to sue whoever implements something that is wrong
3980025 it could cost the state millions and thats beyond the drug testing issue itself
3980026 i dont know how the office of collective bargaining or the employer group is going to be able to have good faith bargaining with a union that at least in two counts has apparently decided what they negotiated back in april 2007 they dont have to live up to
3980027 the defendant took a baseball bat and hit them on the head causing it to bleed leaving scars on both of their heads
3980028 was torture it was absolute atrocities and cruelties that were done to them that no child should ever ever have to endure for over a year
3980029 all the defense wanted the state to do was to consider whether or not we would think about asking that and i can consider that i dont think thats justice and thats why we did not enter into a plea agreement for his case

3980035 in the new covenant our old heart is removed and a new softer pliable heart of flesh is put in its place but if our heart is changed is it possible for our lives also not to change of course not changed people live in a changed way this is why judgment outside of john is always done on the basis of our lives i e works our changed lives of obedience show the reality of the heart changed through faith this is the obedience of faith it is an obedience that first shows itself in a response of faith and an obedience that necessarily moves into a life of ever increasing faithful obedience

3980041 what we hope to achieve is continued cooperation with the federal government

3980064 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
3980065 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
3980066 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

3980080 we cant drill our way out of this problem just like we cant conserve our way out of this problem just like we cant alternative fuels our way out of this problem
3980081 there is no one solution to this theres an integrative set of solutions and you have to undertake them all so when the whole debate focuses around we have to choose this one solution or that people are missing the point
3980082 for people or policymakers to pick one as being the winner is really shortsighted
3980083 and that does get to the question of are we doing everything here at home that we could be doing and i think most people have come to the realization that for many many years the united states has not fully developed its own natural resources

3980086 its only asphalt out there the tree was the only saving grace
3980087 we would argue that the tree is severely damaged and will likely not recover fully

3980092 please take a moment to pause at the glory of this tree and pray for its survival
3980093 the biggest decision we had to make on the first day was to clear the area and create a collapse zone around the severely damaged 7 world trade center a 47 story building heavily involved in fire
3980094 one of the most common structures today is the strip mall built with steel bar joists and metal deck roofs a serious fire in one of these structures should be expected to produce roof collapse in as little as five to 10 minutes as such they too should be attacked from defensive positions steel does have one advantage over wood trusses in that if the steel can be cooled with hose streams it will retain and even regain its strength
3980095 class 1 fire resistive buildings typical of high rise construction usually are designated as having three or four hour fire resistance ratings in the past that was taken to mean that they would never be a serious collapse threat while this is usually the case in the completed structures it is not a guarantee particularly in the steel framed high rise that relies on some type of spray on or membrane fireproofing to protect the steel the 1 meridian plaza fire in philadelphia proved that these can be severe dangers under the wrong set of circumstances

3980111 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
3980112 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle

3980155 all of these people will outnumber the voters that actually comprehend the obama is an empty suit
3980156 is he telling the truth about his thoughts and conclusions or is he merely saying what we want to hear
3980157 no one has been able to find any statements by obama regarding south ossetia or abkhazia prior to this past week
3980158 13 ers 88 of the 20 13 plus leaners 17
3980159 my concern is that he wont be constrained by congress so some of these more extreme policies might become law

3980163 through agents such as hiss the brandeis frankfurter apparatus branched out into all departments of the roosevelt administration
3980164 obama disagree with the idea that the american military is the principal threat to world peace
3980165 idea is that i do not believe obama thinks we are the biggest problem in the world
3980166 i just dont find the ayers connection and the implications that keep getting loaded into it very interesting i think weve seen enough of obama to know he is no mad bomber
3980167 on election day you can find white trash at your local tavern
3980168 lets not even get into the treason mccain committed while in vietnam no lets give over a night at the convention to that theme make a 20 state media buy around it bang that drum freddy
3980169 i had no idea there were so many retards in this country
3980170 yet in mccains own words just four days after being captured he admits he violated the u
3980171 o k ill give you military information if you will take me to the hospital
3980172 he received the nations third highest award the silver star for treason he provided aid and comfort to the enemy
3980173 this is serious freddy any meme about mccain and his wartime service will not reflect well on obama
3980174 well he said the phrase swiftboat lies which of course he cant name a single lie as neither can kerry or he would have taken up t boone pickens on his offer
3980175 flying too low over the iberian peninsula he took out some power lines which led to a spate of newspaper stories in which he was predictably identified as the son of an admiral
3980176 keating was what 30 years ago rezko is going to be sentenced at the end of the dem convention uncle tony had obama in his pocket for longer than mccain even knew keating and mccain never actually did a damn thing for keating while obama was instrumental in carrying legislation that was crucial to rezkos corruption of hospital boards one of the hospitals involved had paid obamas wife over 150k per year to do absolutely nothing of merit
3980177 though he was not convicted of anything mccain intervened on behalf of charles keating after keating gave mccain at least 112 00 in contributions
3980178 an obama presidency would almost certainly mean enactment of the
3980179 and to say he didnt do anything for mccain and this right before the s and l scandal is laughable
3980180 board shall be appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate
3980181 taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
3980182 you crowd are the same brainiacs that voted for bush twice nice work basically youve been wrong about everything for 8 years
3980183 and they will analogize obamas outbursts with such incidences as the clearing of the temple by jesus christ as recorded in the gospels
3980184 whats worse a friendship with bill ayers or having helped charles keating try to get out of a federal investigation
3980185 mccain did commit treason he did help the enemy that you let it slide because he was tortured kinda messes with republican policy of torturing muslims as a source of accurate information
3980186 actions were not improper nor attended with gross negligence and did not reach the level of requiring institutional action against him senator mccain has violated no law of the united states or specific rule of the united states senate
3980187 the appearance of it was wrong its a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence and it was the wrong thing to do
3980188 some critics of mr kerry quoted in the book had earlier praised his bravery in incidents they were now asserting he had fabricated one had earned a medal for bravery in a gun battle he accused mr kerry of concocting
3980189 the idea that we should talk about ayers wartime behavior but leave out huge chunks of mccains
3980190 we play with them here over there they are out for blood that is the difference
3980191 some critics of mr kerry quoted in the book had earlier praised his bravery in incidents they were now asserting he had fabricated one had earned a medal for bravery in a gun battle he accused mr kerry of concocting
3980192 im still thinking the republican 527s are going to use ayers and dohrn to wipe obama out in october when normal voters start paying attention

3980205 por nuestra parte le dimos un espacio de 60 d as al gobierno a trav s de industria y comercio para que entonces nos sentemos a buscarle soluci n al problema ya que hemos perdido una gran cantidad de combustible en los vol menes de ventas
3980206 la mec nica que estamos sugiriendo es de doble v a primero que los colegas que est n secos sean los primeros que reciban para que en los pueblos y municipios retorne la posibilidad de recibir combustibles
3980207 eso permitir una m s r pida posibilidad de colocar combustibles en todas las estaciones y puedan retomar el servicio con una cierta normalidad

3980214 stotts ignores that hagees new apparent defense of his inflammatory remarks and more specifically his claim that his critics do not understand the bible view seems to contradict his previous retraction of them
3980215 it is deeply troubling to pick up a newspaper and read sweeping condemnations of things you did in fact say but which are not new or controversial to those who believe in an all powerful god who is sovereign and intervenes in human history
3980216 if pastor hagee were intent on attacking catholics it wouldnt make much sense to invite them to his summit during the banquet pastor hagee recognized bill donohue and two other catholic leaders as his honored guests
3980217 perhaps because she was too busy trying to decouple hagee from mccain even though prominent mccain supporter joe lieberman was a featured speaker at hagees cufi event

3980242 can you give me one good reason not to quit
3980243 when i planted the fern and the bamboo seeds i took very good care of them i gave them light i gave them water the fern quickly grew from the earth its brilliant green covered the floor yet nothing came from the bamboo seed but i did not quit on the bamboo
3980244 in the second year the fern grew more vibrant and plentiful and again nothing came from the bamboo seed but i did not quit on the bamboo
3980245 in the third year there was still nothing from the bamboo seed but i would not quit
3980246 in the fourth year again there was nothing from the bamboo seed still i would not quit
3980247 then in the fifth year a tiny sprout emerged from the earth compared to the fern it was seemingly small and insignificant but just 6 months later the bamboo rose to over 100 feet tall it had spent the five years growing roots those roots made it strong and gave it what it needed to survive i would not give any of my creations a challenge they could not handle
3980248 did you know my child that all this time you have been struggling you have actually been growing roots i would not quit on the bamboo i will never quit on you dont compare yourself to others the bamboo had a different purpose than the fern yet they both make the forest beautiful your time will come

3980251 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3980268 not only do they sweat a lot but sodium losses in two hours of football practice can be 8 000 milligrams a day
3980269 every year the rookies come in and theyre a little more savvy because theyve been working with sports dietitians in college
3980270 they eat more chicken and fish theyre eating a lot more turkey burgers than beef they eat more smoked turkey
3980271 theyre not big dessert eaters the desserts are all the way in the back so theyre a little hard to get to but they really dont prefer it

3980277 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3980278 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3980279 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3980280 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3980287 internal links can really drive a page but if the internal anchor text is too well aligned with the anchor text page title and headings that might suppress rankings for the target keyword
3980288 your outbound links help define what community your site belongs in
3980289 if too many pages are near the exact size or similar in size to many spam documents it may seem like the document has a higher probability of being spam google has also been growing more stringent with what they are willing to let in their index by requiring a minimum page rank threshold to allow documents in their primary index longer and more authoritative documents are better than breaking articles into many shorter pages
3980290 clear organization not only helps search engines understand how documents relate to each other but also effectively distributes your link authority
3980291 some types of documents are frequently updated while others are rarely updated make sure your page matches your sites profile
3980292 i actually think having a few misspellings in a page makes it easier to rank because there are so many less legitimate pages using those misspellings but if misspellings might cost credibility points with end users it might make sense to have a person make a misspelling in a page comment or in one of your inbound links
3980293 if you can get designers to think that your stuff is better because it validates more of them will pay attention to you subscribe to your feed and link at your site otherwise i believe validation is somewhat over hyped

3980335 but everything came together for him tonight when he has a nasty change up his cutter looks so much better
3980336 thats for sure his pitch count was down he pitched late i was impressed by the way he was able to slow the game down there were certain situations when that bit him in the past
3980337 my ball was up and it was flat buehrle threw a great game when a guy is on like that you cant afford to have the ball up or miss a comebacker
3980338 when you have seven high quality at bats in 32 plate appearances
3980339 youre not going to beat anybody much less a first place team
3980340 but i think both sides are comfortable where we are and it will get done
3980341 were going to do everything we can as an organization to get it done
3980342 i would anticipate it would go down to the deadline like last year
3980343 hes starting to get there as far as getting down in the zone
3980344 theres always a question in your mind when you first come back as to whether youre ok or not
3980345 i was able to get the ball down nearly all of the time thats what im working on every day to keep the ball down
3980346 were already experiencing that in traffic congestion in schools and in our crowded coastal areas
3980347 he has not shown that the u s has either as a matter of deliberate policy or official indiffernce required or allowed its combatants to engage in widespread actions in violation of humanitarian law
3980348 no matter how much i wanted to i could not convince myself that killing someone was right
3980349 i have already missed a large chunk of my young sons life and i was willing to sacrifice any more lost time with him especially during his formative years
3980350 because it is an act of aggression with no defensive basis it has been supported by pretenses that cannot withstand even elementary scrutiny first before the u s dropped the first bomb it was quite evident that iraq had no weapons of mass destruction second the bush administration had the gall to exploit the american publics fear of terrorists by making the absurd assertion that a secular batthist government was working with a fundamentalist terrorist group there was nevery any intelligence to substantiate this third the notion that the u s wants to export democracy to iraq is laughable democracy is by the people not an appointed puppet theater
3980351 a u s soldier who deserted his iraq bound regiment and sought asylum in canada said the u s war in iraq was illegal and he accused the united states of committing war crimes pfc jeremy hinzman 25 is believed to be the first u s soldier to apply for refugee status in canada after refusing combat duty in iraq
3980352 i was told in basic training that if im given an illegal or immoral order it is my duty to disobey it
3980353 whether a country lives under freedom or tyranny or whatever else thats the collective responsibility of the people of that country
3980354 this is a very disappointing decision it puts canada more fully in complicity with an illegal and immoral war jeremy will probably end up back here at fort bragg thats usually what happens
3980355 i applied for conscientious objector status in the u s army because i realized that i cannot kill a fellow humna being but my application was denied i knew that in iraq i would be ordered to take part in combat operations or other actions that are against my principles
3980356 nga and i knew canada had welcomed many americans like us during the vietnam war and we knew canada had refused to join the invasion of iraq
3980357 sending jeremy and his family back to the u s where he would face harsh punishment would be cruel
3980358 it would fly in the face of the motion adopted by the house of commons on june 3 which called on the harper government to stop all deportation proceedings against these conscientious objectors
3980359 jeremy hinzman 29 had filed for a pre removal risk assessment and permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds with citizenship and immigration canada in january after several prior failed attempts to gain refugee status today he was told that both of those applications had been rejected and he must leave the country by sept 23
3980360 obviously were disappointed but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we end up
3980361 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed
3980362 robidoux said hinzman who lives in toronto with his wife and two children plans to take a close look at the decisions before deciding how to proceed
3980363 federal ndp citizenship and immigration critic olivia chow who put foward the june 3rd parliament motion called the decision to expell jeremy mean spirited she called on citizenship and immigration minister diane finley to hald the deporation of hinzman and other resisters immediately
3980364 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
3980365 these refugees have an uncertain status they are referred to as guests not refugees and year long residency permits are hard to obtain the vast majority were granted short stays in the country which since 2005 have become virtually impossible to renew without official paperwork the refugees are not allowed to work
3980366 are being sold for sex there is a large sex trade in young iraqi girls in the nighclubs of damascus fourteen and fifteen year olds literally girls not even women yet and even children are being sold
3980367 they have been great to me but i will no longer be involved with the pageant due to the fact that i really couldnt take it when i saw all those refugees in syria being mistreated seing these people suffer made me ashamed i dont deserve to live in a classy apartment while other women are selling themselves what kind of sick demented human being would want to have sex with a 10 year old
3980368 annual government budget in iraq exceeds 70 billion us dollars where is that money going power cuts are long people get electricity for only an hour or two a day water is cut off as well
3980369 u s lawmakers appropriated 8 5 billion to train and equip iraqs security forces in 2007 and 2008 of that sum roughly 457 million went to the iraqi air force
3980370 t he bad news is that 12 000 people represent a tiny fraction of the vast exodus of iraqis driven from their homes by the violence and ethnic cleansing unleashed by the 2003 u s invasion estimates of their number vary the widely used figure of 5 million is about one in five to get that into context relative to the size of the population it would equal the forced displacement of almost 60 million americans
3980371 at the end of july european countries decided to halt the processing of accepting new refugees and to postpone until september discussions about those who submitted their requests for refugee status the decision does not stem only from concern over the growth in the number of iraqis in europe and an increase in the muslim element on the continent but primarily against the backdrop of iraqi preime minister nuri request to stop absorbing refugees al maliki explained to european heads of state and interior ministers he met with that the situation in iraq has improved and iraq needs its refugees in order to rebuild the state

3980410 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3980411 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
3980412 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
3980413 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
3980414 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
3980415 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
3980416 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
3980417 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
3980418 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
3980419 i write for the same reason i breathe because if i didnt i would die
3980420 as long as people in a society are hungry or out of work or lack the basic skills needed to survive the use of public resources to support the arts is inappropriate and perhaps even cruel when one considers all the potential uses of such money
3980421 this type of behavior from an elected official is simply unacceptable
3980422 but this is the attitude that many in the majority party have towards the little people who come to sacramento to participate in the legislative process even when our staff is belittled publicly by arrogant lawmakers we have never been cursed at this is beyond the pale
3980423 the legislative process is supposed to encourage citizen involvement and input
3980424 treating citizens with such disdain by crudely attacking them for sharing their opinion will enforce the public belief that many elected officials are elitists who could care less about their constituents
3980425 this was a public attack and it deserves a public apology
3980426 sen wiggins should be ashamed of her outrageous outburst and we demand a public apology to pastor jones
3980427 we just simply invite the committee to have people from the community that can speak to those issues in a way that will certainly bring their voices to the table i think we partner with you as representatives of the community and of the people in our commitment to better serve the people
3980428 let me step in here we very much appreciate your presence here today youre right the community should be part of the discussions
3980429 the receptionist told me that i had the wrong attitude then she began to lecture me when i wouldnt let her do so she hung up on me clearly the folks in sacramento think that theyre above us
3980430 i called sen wiggins office and was accused of being sexist because i called for a public apology to the people of the state of california for sen wiggins use of profanity and apparently i have never complained about any of the male senators using profanity the ca state government is out of control
3980431 it is an honor to serve the residents of the 2nd senate district which includes portions or all of six counties humboldt lake mendocino napa solano amp sonoma
3980432 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
3980433 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
3980434 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
3980435 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
3980436 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
3980437 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
3980438 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
3980439 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
3980440 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
3980441 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
3980442 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
3980443 la congregaci n para la doctrina de la fe con carta del 29 de enero del a o en curso ha indicado una cuesti n se alada por algunos obispos referente a la posibilidad de permitir a la sociedad geneal gica de utah mormones de microfilmar y digitalizar las informaciones contenidas en los registros parroquiales
3980444 absolutely nude chick tied up and covered with hot wax by her brutal master
3980445 i think these numbers should provide a bit more assurance to policy makers that wages growth overall remain fairly well under control
3980446 the annual growth over the last year at around 3 75 to four shouldnt really provide any alarm to policy makers
3980447 the fact that they didnt suggests that it is a precautionary cut back in spending rather than a really forced cut back
3980448 if you expect the unemployment rate to rise over the next year then it will take a fair while before that reflected in lower wages growth
3980449 despite its volatility the rba will take some comfort that the growth in this measure has moderated and is now closer to the more reliable wage cost index data released yesterday
3980450 truckstop drivethrough closed for repairs shaggy 2 dope this brought alot of laughs from people who witnessed the event that night
3980451 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3980452 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3980453 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3980454 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3980455 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3980456 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3980457 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3980458 det h r med resurser till skolan k nns som bullshit
3980459 i debated this fellow many times throughout the state in 2006 and it was like pulling teeth to get him to commit to a position or a plan
3980460 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3980461 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3980462 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3980463 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3980464 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
3980465 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
3980466 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
3980467 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
3980468 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
3980469 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
3980470 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
3980471 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
3980472 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3980473 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
3980474 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
3980475 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
3980476 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3980477 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
3980478 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
3980479 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3980480 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3980481 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3980482 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well

3980492 i enjoy your newsletters and continually learn something new from
3980493 i was wondering if you and chief joseph might consider doing a column
3980494 any light that you can shed on this subject would be appreciated
3980495 also what if some of the parties to the contract decide not to
3980496 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
3980497 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
3980498 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
3980499 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
3980500 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
3980501 these are all small things and they all add up
3980502 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
3980503 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms

3980506 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
3980507 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
3980508 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
3980509 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
3980510 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
3980511 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
3980512 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3980513 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
3980514 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3980515 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3980516 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3980517 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3980518 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3980519 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3980520 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3980521 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3980522 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3980523 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3980524 just so you all know we did set a record
3980525 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3980526 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3980527 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about

3980532 different local issues like acute gas and power crises and waterlogging prevailing in the port city featured in the meeting where we have tried to give some immediate and short term solutions to the problems
3980533 additional gas will be supplied to the industrial units that could not go into operation for want of gas
3980534 as a short term solution to power crisis we have decided to set up a furnace oil run rental power plant
3980535 though we know it will be a bit expensive we have to look for an alternative way of producing power as an instant solution
3980536 talks with board of investment boi and others concerned are going on
3980537 since its a huge project all the details need to be discussed thoroughly

3980540 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3980541 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3980542 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3980543 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3980544 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3980545 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3980546 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3980547 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3980548 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3980549 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3980550 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3980551 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3980552 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3980553 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3980554 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3980555 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3980556 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3980557 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3980558 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3980559 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3980560 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3980561 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3980562 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3980563 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3980564 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3980565 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3980566 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3980567 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3980568 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3980569 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3980570 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3980571 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3980572 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3980573 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3980574 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3980575 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3980576 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3980577 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3980578 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3980579 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3980580 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

3980583 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3980584 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3980585 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3980586 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3980587 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3980588 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3980589 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3980590 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3980591 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3980592 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3980593 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3980594 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3980595 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3980596 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3980597 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3980598 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3980599 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3980600 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3980601 tenang semua dapat bagian dapat bagian saya mau press conference kok asal objektif yah
3980602 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3980603 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3980604 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3980605 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3980606 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3980607 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3980608 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3980609 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3980610 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3980611 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3980612 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3980613 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3980614 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3980615 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3980616 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3980617 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3980618 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3980619 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3980620 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3980621 the fox knows lots of things the hedgehog knows only one thing but he knows it in his bones
3980622 washington was a monist a hedgehog a charismatic one too
3980623 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3980624 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3980625 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3980626 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3980627 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3980628 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3980629 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3980630 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3980631 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3980632 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3980633 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3980634 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3980635 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3980636 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3980637 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3980638 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3980639 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3980640 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3980641 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3980642 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3980643 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3980644 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3980645 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3980646 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3980647 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3980648 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3980649 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3980650 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3980651 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3980652 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3980653 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3980654 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3980655 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3980656 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3980657 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3980658 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3980659 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3980660 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3980661 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3980662 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3980663 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3980664 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
3980665 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
3980666 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
3980667 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
3980668 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
3980669 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3980670 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3980671 thatd be loads of fun to do in real life
3980672 you really have to keep in mind how much its gonna cost
3980673 candidate so and so his penis is a whole lot bigger than that other guy
3980674 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3980675 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3980676 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3980677 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3980678 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3980679 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3980680 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3980681 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3980682 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3980683 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3980684 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3980685 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3980686 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3980687 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3980688 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3980689 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3980690 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3980691 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3980692 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3980693 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3980694 if i had a turkey sandwich in one hand and a gun in the other hand marta police would ticket me for the turkey sandwich
3980695 turn up the bus noise on the brain and see what pops out
3980696 i believe the nicest and sweetest days are not those on which anything splendid or wonderful or exciting happens but just those that bring simple little pleasures following one another softly like pearls slipping off a string
3980697 i am waiting for you vizzini you told me to go back to the beginning so i have this is where i am and this is where ill stay i will not be moved
3980698 love is like quicksilver in the hand leave the fingers open and it stays clutch it and it darts away
3980699 follow your heart but be quiet for a while first ask questions then feel the answer learn to trust your heart
3980700 its not so much that were afraid of change or so in love with the old ways but its that place in between that we fear its like being between trapezes its linus when his blanket is in the dryer theres nothing to hold on to
3980701 education is not a bucket to be filled but a fire to be lit
3980702 you should date my friend bertha her looks are ok
3980703 you should go out with my roommate garfield hes not ugly
3980704 xml is good for describing data and terrible for describing behavior
3980705 ive heard this argument complaint about ant a hundred times and i still dont get it you dont program in xml with ant ant is almost completely declarative and its dead simple to use write a custom task if you need to do something esoteric imho
3980706 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3980707 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3980708 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3980709 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3980710 last spring i set about learning javacs tree api jsr 199
3980711 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3980712 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3980713 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3980714 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3980715 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3980716 the fact that the jtree as cell renderer design works at all is just an accident of how basiclookandfeels treeui implementation was designed
3980717 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3980718 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3980719 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3980720 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech

3980734 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3980735 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3980736 you can be much better if you listen to others quietly

3980742 like every decision in life studying english must be something you want to do
3980743 i can see you dont feel happy now because many of us dont study hard we are too naughty and sometimes we make troubles we are forced to learn many things that are boring useless and not valuable so we are tired of studying have you ever been forced to do anything that you really didnt want to do if so you can understand why the students do so
3980744 i think a good teacher should be the students close friend who shares their ups and downs
3980745 you are clever and diligent you must believe in yourself only in this way can you make it come and ask me anytime you like i will help you you know im always with you
3980746 to look or not to look when to look and how long to look who and who not to look at
3980747 the japanese are group animals and each person belongs to some kind of group the chinese gain ground via the family or blood relationships but they act individually outside them
3980748 i got a job but until i start work i will not belong to any group that makes me anxious up to now i have always belonged to some group such as school groups or some other social circle
3980749 to speak of the vatican is to speak of rome this is as true today as it has ever been in the past it is much more than the center of catholicism because it has absorbed within itself the great heritage of the classical world in which our own civilization still has its roots the vatican like rome of old is in a sense communis patria the universal fatherland it has become the richer for that and it has suffered too it has aroused passionate enthusiasm and love and no less passionate hatred even for those who do not share the catholic faith and have had no contact with western civilization the vatican is still a symbol and a historical reality that must be taken into account therefore whatever our point of view may be when we speak about the vatican we have to realize its unique quality in history we have to enter into it to think and feel ourselves into it even if we consider it only as a collection of buildings and works of art st peters the vatican museums and so on we are confronted by a unifying vision of two thousand years of western culture whether we come as pilgrims or as visitors interested in art and culture we come up against the vatican as an artifact of history we can see how it grew where it was altered or destroyed day after day and year after year when we go into st peters or the papal palace we are immediately immersed in history the centuries speak to us and we can touch as it were the point of intersection between an ancient and a modern world and this is something that happens to everyone irrespective of the breadth or narrowness of his cultural horizon

3980759 when they are holding the card even when they see the logo that creates a momentary craving
3980760 those who were holding the credit cards were bidding about twice as high as the cash people
3980761 sometimes people buy by price but that can be a false economy
3980762 you ultimately would save more in the long run getting an energy efficient or energy star refrigerator that will use less electricity over 10 or 15 years
3980763 people get out of the habit of going dont like it
3980764 had they gone by the month even though it was slightly more expensive per month that would have been more economical
3980765 free is a magic word and many of the marketing tricks are crafted around that desire
3980766 from the information we obtained there are significant issues that need to be addressed regarding the scope of the capital city state park project
3980767 first and foremost is the question of whether the state should be spending millions of dollars to eliminate parking spaces used by the public who visit the war memorial patriots theatre the state museum state library and legislative offices
3980768 it wouldnt surprise me if were talking about a project cost in excess of 100 million
3980769 theres a large train of thought that one of the best ways of dealing with avian influenza is by detection and containment
3980770 the ability to detect and type the influenza virus immediately is essential in setting up controls as quickly as possible to minimise the spread of any potential pandemic virus
3980771 it was bit harder than last night after the relay i was physically and emotionally drained so to get in and do another 53 point this morning was great
3980772 i have got a night off now so i can get focused and ready for tomorrow morning
3980773 i didnt really think about what time i needed but to go quicker than yesterday is good and its only a fraction off my best time so hopefully i can get up again tomorrow morning and go a bit quicker
3980774 i was so excited to sign and my family they thought it was incredible
3980775 watching games will be easier now instead of having to stay up late its great to have the opportunity to play in the city where i grew up

3980778 its definitely a great team to come into with a lot of talent some of the best players in the world on that team
3980779 hopefully ill get a good opportunity to contribute and everything works out
3980780 i kind of became a goal scoring type of player but as you move onto the pro level ive been just trying to get accustomed to playing both ends of the ice
3980781 you can be an offensive player but talking to pro coaches and general managers they want me to work on my defensive game more the last few years ive really concentrated on being a total player in my end
3980782 that was a little well interesting when he showed up to train
3980783 when they are holding the card even when they see the logo that creates a momentary craving

3980790 i can well imagine the international outcry if islamic tourists were to encounter such restrictions on their entry into israel
3980791 either enter jordan without religious objects or go back to israel
3980792 they seemed to know exactly what they were looking for
3980793 it was very demeaning to have such a negative experience in what is billed as a friendly country people in the group including the tour guides were quite shocked no one had ever heard that jordan imposed religious restrictions
3980794 what made it worse was that the whole thing seemed to be directed solely at jews i saw christians walking through into jordan openly wearing crosses apparently christian religious symbols did not seem to be a problem for the jordanians i can well imagine the international outcry if islamic tourists were to encounter such restrictions on their entry into israel
3980795 the jordanian security authorities are responsible for the safety of all visitors to the kingdom and it is our duty to take all measures required in this regard
3980796 the vast majority of the group decided that as proud israelis we were either going to be allowed to walk into jordan holding our religious objects or we would not go in at all

3980800 its difficult to imagine a circumstance where the government could directly control interest rates without a whole range of adverse consequences occurring a whole range of other things mr tanner told abc radio
3980801 weve seen it in the past for example where we had a cap on interest rates
3980802 what that meant was that people ended up with cocktail loans for their homes where they borrowed a proportion of their mortgage at the official interest rate and had to borrow the rest at a really high interest rate much much higher than the official rate
3980803 now i wouldnt speculate about what they might be and of course its not my direct responsibility mr tanner said
3980804 well cross that bridge if and when we come to it if we believe that the banks are not doing the right thing then clearly we will be examining the options to put greater pressure on
3980805 rolled gold guarantees on rates because theyve got other factors that they have to worry about as well
3980806 whats your problem bud eat your own damn food and stop staring at me
3980807 some commentators have suggested the government establish an aussie mac as a mechanism to inject liquidity into the market and provide a price discovery function in times of severe market stress treasury executive director markets group jim murphy told a a federal parliamentary committee hearing in sydney
3980808 it appears that for some the aussie mac proposal is seen as a mechanism to address the current problems in securitisation markets
3980809 treasury strongly disagrees with this in that the treasurer has ruled out establishing a government body of this nature
3980810 we think its important to note that underlying australias rmbs markets are high quality assets and it is expected that once some normality returns to the market this will assist in accumulating demand for rmbs and restoring this funding channel
3980811 one can only speculate why superannuation funds are not involved in this but they make their own decisions
3980812 we have recently seen a decrease in the bank bill rate of approximately 40 basis points resulting in a fall of the cost of raising new funds he said
3980813 we saw the banks increase their interest rates when funding costs went up
3980814 on the same token we expect lenders to pass on any reduction in funding costs to their customers in a timely way

3980847 bottom up advertising with publishers selecting the favorite brands they would want to endorse
3980848 in reality bloggers or other similar online authority figures could publicly pre elect companies and brands that they would want to be brand ambassadors for they could do this directly on their sites and or via their representative advertising agencies this advertising model would provide companies embracing it with a communication vehicle with much higher impact and effectiveness that anything they have done so far via traditional advertising it is likely that such brands would need multiple such brand ambassadors addressing the many different target audiences making up their potential customer base to independent publishers and online bloggers this advertising model would offer the opportunity to re synch communication with marketing instead of keeping them tightly separate while guaranteeing also a longer and more stable revenue stream it would also offer the opportunity for individual publishers to leverage their authority and influence to convey messages and promotions for products and companies they truly believe in
3980849 yes you say but you are going to be influenced by those who pay you yes i answer but so do you with the people that spend big money on your site with traditional advertising and if that is not so how in any case can people tell how can they find out whether the new review article or link you did was a consequence of a return favor you are doing to an advertising agency or to a past direct advertiser who would want to come back unless you have some very strict and public disclosure policy about this info it is going only through your actions over time that people will be able to tell whether you have your own integrity or whether you are simply a marketing puppet at the service of whoever pays you more

3980911 in terms of market share weve seen the local manufacturers go from a position perhaps five years ago where they were more than 30 per cent of domestic sales down to less than 20 per cent now
3980912 that is a lot of taxpayers money and were not necessarily getting the product that the taxpayer as the consumer actually wants as a consequence of that expenditure of public money
3980913 if it comes to a bidding war with a cheque book we cannot match victoria in that record regard
3980914 the recent collapse of the doha negotiations is a factor that cant be ignored in that regard and its something the government will have to take into account when it looks at what the future direction of tariffs should be
3980915 reduced tariffs lower the cost of motor vehicles and thats good for the consumers and good for motorists generally
3980916 they are genuinely interested in helping the industry in what is a very challenging time
3980917 it is a major exporter it is a major source of research and development its strategically vital for the rest of manufacturing
3980918 it provides the skills formation base for so many other industries from plastics to aerospace this is a critically important industry to the future of this country
3980919 worrying signs on the horizon if you like and we just think that that would be to the detriment of motorists in this country
3980920 taking the tariffs down preferably reducing them completely would not only lower price of vehicles to consumers in this country but would also broaden the range of vehicles that are available

3981010 sullivan who did not swim his best when it really counted
3981011 i have saved again inay ill be able to send money next month
3981012 thats why we now find we are in a position to cut interest rates
3981013 the resource and energy sectors are the locomotives of the market today with bhp rio and woodside all up over four per cent after not a bad night from commodity markets
3981014 the reports that have been coming out by companies over this week have also been really good really impressive and that gives a bit of fortification to the overall markets performance
3981015 initially everything seems much more interesting and a much more cool place
3981016 the perfect cook and has has the perfect answer to any question
3981017 the combination of henry selick and neil gaiman seems very potent
3981018 when i learned that henry selick was directing it there was no way that i could say no
3981019 as this movie is still in production this coraline featurette contains some shots that are not yet final
3981020 ive definitely learned a lot from this meet she said
3981021 now i have something to work on for the future
3981022 continues to evaluate opportunities to accelerate md 80 replacement with additional 737s
3981023 its difficult to imagine a circumstance where the government could directly control interest rates without a whole range of adverse consequences occurring a whole range of other things mr tanner told abc radio
3981024 weve seen it in the past for example where we had a cap on interest rates
3981025 what that meant was that people ended up with cocktail loans for their homes where they borrowed a proportion of their mortgage at the official interest rate and had to borrow the rest at a really high interest rate much much higher than the official rate
3981026 now i wouldnt speculate about what they might be and of course its not my direct responsibility mr tanner said
3981027 well cross that bridge if and when we come to it if we believe that the banks are not doing the right thing then clearly we will be examining the options to put greater pressure on
3981028 rolled gold guarantees on rates because theyve got other factors that they have to worry about as well
3981029 they will have a very heavy onus to both the government and the community to explain that
3981030 our peaceful action highlighted the rudd and bligh governments plans to rapidly expand coal exports when the world is trying to cut global emissions
3981031 it is contradictory and immoral for our political leaders to be expanding australias export coal industry whilst talking about urgent action on climate change
3981032 australia is concerned that despite the announcement of a ceasefire agreement which commits both sides to a cessation of all hostilities and the withdrawal of troops to positions held before the conflict broke out there have been reports of ongoing military action by russian forces
3981033 australia calls on russia to honour the terms of the ceasefire respect the territorial integrity of georgia and resolve its differences with georgia through peaceful means
3981034 the military action taken by russia has been disproportionate and has resulted in widespread damage and heavy casualties
3981035 a further 500 000 has been allocated to the international committee of the red cross icrc for the immediate provision of medical supplies to hospitals and the deployment of field hospitals for critical surgery in gori and south ossetia
3981036 maybe they were preoccupied with other life issues or selfish or stupid or stubborn
3981037 if your normal happy go lucky 12 year old child cant walk unaided for a period of weeks screams in pain cant shower wet and soils herself in her clothes if no one helps her to the toilet cries in the night and cant walk the next day you shouldnt need any medical training to have worked out that she is a very very sick young girl
3981038 the standard of care was not breached in this case
3981039 all of the foundation of the crown case is simply false i am asking you ladies and gentleman to put an end to all of this just end it for gods sake and allow her ms reynolds to grieve
3981040 if it is your view that facs should have done more well perhaps they should have
3981041 perhaps they should have done a lot more before this day
3981042 maybe they were preoccupied with other life issues or selfish or stupid or stubborn
3981043 cabinet will look at what further measures will be possible to reduce the pressure on a system
3981044 there is much much more to be done and we are working hard on this
3981045 the core reason for the pressure on the system being we are in the middle of an appallingly low level of rainfall and i cant make it rain
3981046 you cant turn the queen mary around to be sailing in a particular direction for the last 12 years in six months
3981047 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
3981048 the us stands with the democratically elected government of georgia insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3981049 we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3981050 very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
3981051 any civilised country would act same way i may remind you that on september 11 2001 the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction
3981052 they really took it seriously we are always proud when students work hard
3981053 we all felt we wanted our students to really review for the test and be prepared and i think because we took the time to talk about it they were more focused think that helped
3981054 at this point it is not an amount that we are going to have a huge concern yet we really look at 3 to 5 year trends on standardized test scores to see were things are but we are a little disappointed
3981055 one of our goals is to increase the number of students taking the act test and we knew if we are increasing the number of students and we knew it was a possibility that we could see some decline in scores
3981056 we will have to go back and analyze what we are doing we will have to watch our explorer plan and act scores again next year and see if this is an aberration or is there something that we need to go and address
3981057 creo que es una selecci n la de colombia fuerte con una buena defensa
3981058 es muy prematuro hablar de las posibilidades de colombia por haber visto apenas un partido
3981059 yo siempre admir al hombre de la cabeza rubia y enrulada l estuvo en el mundial de 1998 que nosotros ganamos en casa yo era muy chico pero lo recuerdo bien
3981060 boston and chicago midway are on the top of the list but washington national and philadelphia are close behind
3981061 all of them are on our radar screen for the short term
3981062 even in july and august which normally is the traffic peak period the domestic demand still fell by a big margin compared to the same period of last year
3981063 my concerns include the transactions effects on service costs consumer choice and jobs
3981064 a number of concerns have been raised regarding consolidation in the airfreight business in general and the proposed consolidation involving dhl in particular including the impact on jobs in the affected communities
3981065 problematic for a number of reasons we find it very troubling that a company in a concentrated market would turn to one of its chief competitors to find cost savings
3981066 dhls decision to abandon the wilmington facility and the surrounding communities will have consequences americans are starting to rethink their views on the benefits of global investment and the interconnected global economic system if dhls actions towards wilmington are indicative continued erosion in public support for international investment and the global economy is the likely result
3981067 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3981068 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3981069 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3981070 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3981071 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3981072 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3981073 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3981074 who are open to doing something on the production side
3981075 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3981076 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3981077 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3981078 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3981079 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3981080 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3981081 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3981082 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3981083 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3981084 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3981085 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3981086 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3981087 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3981088 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3981089 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3981090 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3981091 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3981092 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3981093 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3981094 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3981095 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3981096 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3981097 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3981098 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3981099 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3981100 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3981101 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3981102 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3981103 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3981104 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3981105 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3981106 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3981107 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3981108 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3981109 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3981110 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3981111 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3981112 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3981113 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3981114 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3981115 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3981116 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3981117 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3981118 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3981119 yoursite com wp admin categories php action edit amp cat id 1 all the info for your original category should be there unless you deleted then go into phpmyadmin and find the id of one of your other categories
3981120 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3981121 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3981122 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3981123 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3981124 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3981125 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3981126 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3981127 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3981128 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3981129 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3981130 good for admission unlimited use of guided bus tour express bus amp skyfari aerial tram excludes special ticketed events attractions
3981131 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3981132 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3981133 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3981134 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3981135 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3981136 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3981137 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3981138 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3981139 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3981140 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3981141 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3981142 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3981143 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3981144 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3981145 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3981146 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3981147 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

3981151 in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security
3981152 i think evans real strength is you get someone on the ticket who has a record of being strong on national security and that is a very important quality to have
3981153 wrong on the biggest foreign policy issue of his lifetime
3981154 administration officials argue that low yield nuclear weapons are needed as a credible deterrent against rogue states iran north korea their logic is that existing nuclear weapons are too destructive to be used except in a full scale nuclear war potential enemies realize this thus they do not consider the threat of nuclear retaliation to be credible however low yield nuclear weapons are less destructive thus might conceivably be used that would make them more effective as a deterrent
3981155 since there is simply no realistic prospect of a nuclear free world
3981156 nuclear weapons are the ultimate instrument of an asymmetric response and at the same time the ultimate tool of escalation

3981158 strong record s of bringing people together from the left and the right to solve problems
3981159 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3981160 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3981161 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3981162 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3981163 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3981164 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

3981167 we will witness a day that afghan army would replace the international forces in all over the country
3981168 i wanted to do this not only for myself to reduce energy costs but also of course obviously it helps the environment by not burning fossil fuels
3981169 colleagues from the bomb squad said they have never seen anything like this they only read about it in the literature
3981170 the operation was halted not because president george bush had made a request but because the goals set by the russian president had been attained
3981171 this peacekeeping role cannot be doubted it has been and will be played scrupulously
3981172 he seems to be still worrying that the principles coordinated with the french president contain nothing of the kind instead russias role as a peacekeeper is affirmed there
3981173 on the whole the world has the correct perception of what is going on

3981175 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness
3981176 i like the fact that for the most part my poems are pretty accessible
3981177 unfortunately were receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3981178 we expect russia to honour its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance
3981179 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3981180 on this trip she will continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defence of a free georgia

3981188 tibet is the only region in china where urban education levels are lower than those of rural migrants from the rest of china
3981189 my outer life is that of a rock and roll guitarist and minor rock star but thats not my main interest in being on earth

3981191 we would be like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle we would fit together perfectly

3981193 your chances are next to nil to make it at any kind of historical level to have an impact on the history of rock and roll which is what i wanted from very early on and basically i achieved that so now the rest is just kind of gravy im having the time of my life

3981206 do not love the world or anything in the world if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him for everything in the world the cravings of sinful man the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does comes not from the father but from the world the world and its desires pass away but the man who does the will of god lives forever

3981210 disciplinary action to the maximum degree permitted by indian law
3981211 i would like that the allegations are promptly and thoroughly investigated in a time bound manner
3981212 in keeping with the efforts to ensure the highest standards of discipline and conduct by the indian peacekeepers the vice chief of army staff lt
3981213 it has also been learnt that the office of internal oversight services oios of the un has also conducted an inquiry into the matter we would seek the details of this inquiry to corroborate augment the internal inquiry being conducted by the indian army
3981214 the indian army is committed to ensure that necessary disciplinary action is taken against the individuals if proved guilty
3981215 he reiterates in the strongest possible terms that such behaviour if substantiated is wholly unacceptable and that disciplinary action to the maximum degree permitted by indian law should be taken as soon as possible against those found to be involved in such misconduct
3981216 we can say with confidence and a clear conscience that we have lived with a god given holiness and sincerity in all our dealings we have depended on gods grace not on our own human wisdom that is how we have conducted ourselves before the world and especially toward you our letters have been straightforward and there is nothing written between the lines and nothing you cant understand i hope someday you will fully understand us even if you dont understand us now then on the day when the lord jesus returns you will be proud of us in the same way we are proud of you
3981217 since i was so sure of your understanding and trust i wanted to give you a double blessing by visiting you twice first on my way to macedonia and again when i returned from macedonia then you could send me on my way to judea
3981218 it is god who enables us along with you to stand firm for christ he has commissioned us and he has identified us as his own by placing the holy spirit in our hearts as the first installment that guarantees everything he has promised us
3981219 now i call upon god as my witness that i am telling the truth the reason i didnt return to corinth was to spare you from a severe rebuke but that does not mean we want to dominate you by telling you how to put your faith into practice we want to work together with you so you will be full of joy for it is by your own faith that you stand firm
3981220 so i decided that i would not bring you grief with another painful visit for if i cause you grief who will make me glad certainly not someone i have grieved that is why i wrote to you as i did so that when i do come i wont be grieved by the very ones who ought to give me the greatest joy surely you all know that my joy comes from your being joyful i wrote that letter in great anguish with a troubled heart and many tears i didnt want to grieve you but i wanted to let you know how much love i have for you
3981221 i am not overstating it when i say that the man who caused all the trouble hurt all of you more than he hurt me most of you opposed him and that was punishment enough 7now however it is time to forgive and comfort him otherwise he may be overcome by discouragement so i urge you now to reaffirm your love for him
3981222 i wrote to you as i did to test you and see if you would fully comply with my instructions when you forgive this man i forgive him too and when i forgive whatever needs to be forgiven i do so with christs authority for your benefit so that satan will not outsmart us for we are familiar with his evil schemes
3981223 when i came to the city of troas to preach the good news of christ the lord opened a door of opportunity for me but i had no peace of mind because my dear brother titus hadnt yet arrived with a report from you so i said good bye and went on to macedonia to find him
3981224 but thank god he has made us his captives and continues to lead us along in christs triumphal procession now he uses us to spread the knowledge of christ everywhere like a sweet perfume our lives are a christ like fragrance rising up to god but this fragrance is perceived differently by those who are being saved and by those who are perishing to those who are perishing we are a dreadful smell of death and doom but to those who are being saved we are a life giving perfume and who is adequate for such a task as this
3981225 you see we are not like the many hucksters who preach for personal profit we preach the word of god with sincerity and with christs authority knowing that god is watching us
3981226 we are confident of all this because of our great trust in god through christ it is not that we think we are qualified to do anything on our own our qualification comes from god he has enabled us to be ministers of his new covenant this is a covenant not of written laws but of the spirit the old written covenant ends in death but under the new covenant the spirit gives life
3981227 the old way with laws etched in stone led to death though it began with such glory that the people of israel could not bear to look at moses face for his face shone with the glory of god even though the brightness was already fading away shouldnt we expect far greater glory under the new way now that the holy spirit is giving life if the old way which brings condemnation was glorious how much more glorious is the new way which makes us right with god in fact that first glory was not glorious at all compared with the overwhelming glory of the new way so if the old way which has been replaced was glorious how much more glorious is the new which remains forever
3981228 since this new way gives us such confidence we can be very bold we are not like moses who put a veil over his face so the people of israel would not see the glory even though it was destined to fade away but the peoples minds were hardened and to this day whenever the old covenant is being read the same veil covers their minds so they cannot understand the truth and this veil can be removed only by believing in christ yes even today when they read moses writings their hearts are covered with that veil and they do not understand
3981229 but whenever someone turns to the lord the veil is taken away for the lord is the spirit and wherever the spirit of the lord is there is freedom so all of us who have had that veil removed can see and reflect the glory of the lord and the lord who is the spirit makes us more and more like him as we are changed into his glorious image
3981230 therefore since god in his mercy has given us this new way we never give up we reject all shameful deeds and underhanded methods we dont try to trick anyone or distort the word of god we tell the truth before god and all who are honest know this
3981231 if the good news we preach is hidden behind a veil it is hidden only from people who are perishing satan who is the god of this world has blinded the minds of those who dont believe they are unable to see the glorious light of the good news they dont understand this message about the glory of christ who is the exact likeness of god
3981232 we now have this light shining in our hearts but we ourselves are like fragile clay jars containing this great treasure this makes it clear that our great power is from god not from ourselves
3981233 we are pressed on every side by troubles but we are not crushed we are perplexed but not driven to despair we are hunted down but never abandoned by god we get knocked down but we are not destroyed through suffering our bodies continue to share in the death of jesus so that the life of jesus may also be seen in our bodies
3981234 yes we live under constant danger of death because we serve jesus so that the life of jesus will be evident in our dying bodies so we live in the face of death but this has resulted in eternal life for you
3981235 but we continue to preach because we have the same kind of faith the psalmist had when he said

3981238 all four writers were very generous they gave the students insights on what prompted them to write that particular story at that particular time and they all gave permission and encouragement for the students to make the writing theirs
3981239 one of the things i like most about writing fiction is that so many things can happen to it after it leaves home
3981240 seeing a written narrative become a film is the ultimate compliment because a group of people have gotten together and decided that something about this story is worthwhile and deserves to be seen and understood in another context
3981241 i love to let the story go love to see what others will do to it because the story my story doesnt change in fact no matter how the film turns out its existence serves to enlarge the story and lets face it its just plain fun adam barron the director and the rest of them did a fantastic job
3981242 i wrote this story just 10 years out of high school it was meant as a lovesong to all the pretty able women my mothers age i loved them all they could and should have run multi nationals
3981243 instead they played killer bridge and made exceptional refreshments for cub scout troops kiwanis picnics and card tournaments the duke students film provided a generational frame from which these women might be more richly appreciated the student actors high energy onscreen was just right both broadly comic and deeply respectful of these lives so unlike their own
3981244 i think the class did a terrific job given the monologue like limitations of the original segments taken from the novel which was a series of voices speaking intimately to the reader
3981245 all in all it was fully enjoyable and i have since thought that some parts of it could be opened up like the queen isabella scene which was tremendous fun others tweaked but it has tremendous potential as do many of the actors and actresses who were just exciting to watch their energy being contagious what else can i say i hardly ever revisit my work and felt privileged to be a part in such a nice production
3981246 as a writer i think my favorite part of this class was that it gave me an opportunity to explore all the steps that come after writing to watch whats been written transform from dialogue on the page to conversation to see 25 takes for one 10 second scene to even act a little myself
3981247 ive always imagined my own fiction when im writing it as if the story were a movie replaying in my head i loved that in this class i didnt have to imagine that part when it was all said and done i got to see something i helped write change form
3981248 i was delighted the students got to feel the enchantment in watching their words dialogue and descriptions that they have put on pieces of paper start magically to take on their separate lives as actors and camera angles and music as sets costumes and props
3981249 usually what we see produced of our writing is a surprising gift sometimes a small shock but it is always proof of collaborative imagination energy and passion

3981253 the house is burning down and the president of the united states says this is the way to put out the fire applause and to me at this time there is only one answer to this question and that is to give the president what he demands and says is necessary to meet the situation
3981254 such action is necessary to protect the currency system of the united states
3981255 i would think that our chances of winning in november are probably 50 50
3981256 if we were to put together a good campaign stay on message i think well be successful its a historic election in so many ways and what we have here is an opportunity to demonstrate to the american people that democrats ought to be back in charge of the white house
3981257 i do not believe that would be productive at all its one thing to go to denver unified we need to leave denver unified
3981258 the extent to which the american people do not think weve got it together as a party and are not together as democrats will be counterproductive
3981259 i dont think it will have any impact at all
3981260 not just because of the historical aspect of him being the nominee but it occurring on the 45 anniversary of the i have a dream speech by civil rights leader martin luther king jr
3981261 all of that to me makes it a very historic convention and makes that speech a very historic speech
3981262 we have an outside chance of winning this state for obama but a very good chance of picking up legislative seats in south carolina all of which would bode well for this party coming back to its historical role

3981299 the importance of the judgement of the district court in the defamation case taken by selwyn cushing against new zealand first leader winston peters from the business roundtables perspective is that the accusation that it had sought to exercise improper political influence was found to be totally baseless
3981300 winston peters should as a minimum first step make a full and unequivocal apology forthwith to all parties wrongfully accused
3981301 from a national perspective the sequence of events has highlighted the lack of substance underlying the claims about corruption in new zealand made in the australianfour corners programme and the earlier tvnz programme for the public good
3981302 there have been other instances in recent years of false and exaggerated claims by politicians regulators and journalists about alleged inadequacies in our laws regulations or codes of behaviour as they affect commerce
3981303 contrary to such claims the general reputation ofbusiness in this country for honesty and integrity is deservedly high new zealand has come out in first place in international surveys by transparency international as the country which is freest from corruption in business and politics
3981304 the business roundtable supports demands for the highest standards of honesty and integrity in politics and business it is up to individuals and firms to set such standards and to promote them in the wider community
3981305 as an organisation the business roundtable believes that there is no place for improper influence in any sphere of public life
3981306 when the disreputable television programme for the public good was found to have made blatantly untrue allegations about improper business influence on government decisions television new zealand received the stiffest penalty ever handed down by the broadcasting standards authority
3981307 michael laws resigned from parliament after accusations of improper conduct at a time when new zealand is facing important choices in the coming election it is vital that public debate should focus on the merits of policies that high standards of integrity in politics should be upheld and that those who fall short of them should be held accountable
3981308 the move by the richest man in asia and one of the richest in the world to take a stake in the operation of the port of lyttelton is one that has potentially great benefits for christchurch and canterbury and ultimately the rest of the country
3981309 there is no need to be starry eyed about the proposed venture li ka shing has risen from complete destitution as a refugee who fled the raping and pillaging of china by the japanese in the 1930s to become a multi billionaire
3981310 he did it by being an astute and hard nosed businessman he also did it according to one account in a business journal by remaining true to his internal moral compass and operating with integrity
3981311 such control would have security implications and might affect the panamanian governments views on awarding the port concessions
3981312 according to u s intelligence reports cosco vessels do not just transport oriental bric a brac cosco vessels have been caught carrying two thousand ak 47 assault rifles into california and biological chemical weapons components into north korea pakistan iraq and iran add to these disturbing events that canadian law enforcement agencies have kicked in with hard line information that chinese triad criminal elements are active in and around canadian ports
3981313 conspiracy theories were tossed out the window when u s congressman dana rohrabacher revealed that the u s bureau of export affairs the u s embassy in beijing and the rand corporation had identified li ka shing and hutchison whampoa lis primary business as financing or serving as a conduit for communist chinas military in order for them to acquire sensitive technologies and other equipment
3981314 former prime minister jean chretiens connections to the burgeoning citic conglomerate served as his entr e into the private sector
3981315 while john turner was leader of the federal liberals chretien was working for gordon securities one of the many li controlled companies on canadian soil
3981316 li ka shing the leader of hutchison port holdings chinas primary shipping line has close ties to the chinese communist party and to the citic
3981317 chinas other two huge shipping lines are directly controlled by the communist party one the china ocean shipping co cosco was described in the cox report issued by the us congress as follows although presented as a commercial entity cosco is actually an arm of the chinese military establishment
3981318 in the last decade china has succeeded in building managing or operating strategic ports adjacent to or as in the case of the panama canal at the entrance and exit of seven of these 10 global shipping choke points
3981319 the clinton administration has determined that additional information concerning cosco that appears in the select committees classified final report cannot be made public
3981320 at least three arms shipments were traced from china to the cuban port of mariel during the past several months according to an article tuesday in the
3981321 u s officials said tuesday that the subject of arms trafficking between china and cuba is a worrisome one though they stopped short of confirming the
3981322 we are very much concerned with this pla peoples liberation army cooperation and movement of military equipment in cuba
3981323 id like to suggest that the appropriate congressional committee hold hearings and that they call li ka shing as the first witness i volunteer to be second but frankly there are people far more knowledgeable than me in this regard including for example the international association of airport and seaport police which just held their conference in nyc as a speaker at that conference i urged ridding ports of such crime and rogue government connected companies not making them the local constabulary
3981324 preventing smuggling of drugs guns and people preventing export of stolen products providing site security as a result of 9 11 preventing terrorism related smuggling and preventing attacks on ships leaving ports
3981325 we need full scrutiny of the principals of hutchison whampoa and all of their business or government related associations and any history of any activity of them or their associates
3981326 we should give full scrutiny to any relationship of hutchison whampoa its partners directors or officers with any foreign government that would raise concerns to any or all of the above issues
3981327 western policymakers and business leaders have little or no idea of chinas grand strategy and how beijings leaders want to situate their country for the next century when in 1999 sen trent lott r miss sent
3981328 u s naval ships will be at the mercy of chinese controlled pilots and could even be denied passage it appears we have given away the farm
3981329 at lotts request the senate armed services committee held a hearing in which four clinton administration witnesses testified that hutchison whampoa posed no security challenges to the united states see
3981330 do you believe the peoples republic of china uses commercial enterprises to advance their military interests
3981331 many of those who are engaged in china policy or who invest there remain blithely ignorant of chinese goals to replace the united states as the reigning world power
3981332 through publicly available information we have been able to ascertain that neither hutchison whampoa nor its subsidiaries hutchison port holdings hph and the panama ports company ppc have any significant investment from mainland china
3981333 in the event that christchurch city holdings limiteds cchl takeover offer for lyttelton port company ltd lpc succeeded and hutchison port holdings ltd was introduced into the port of lyttelton the christchurch city council would retain control of the lyttelton port company with a 50
3981334 the purpose of the new port operating company in which hph would have a 50
3981335 the introduction of hutchison port holdings to the port of lyttelton would be subject to the usual regulatory consents that are required when an overseas company is involved
3981336 the lippo group is one of indonesias largest conglomerates in terms of market capitalisation with estimates of value putting it at having us 11 billion in assets
3981337 the vision of its founder mochtar riady is to transcend the institutional limitations placed upon organisations run in the traditional overseas chinese pattern and adopt a modern publicly owned and professionally managed pattern of business
3981338 mochtar has formed alliances and joint venture partnerships with world class multinational corporations and has high calibre professional management staff working for him
3981339 the lippo empire rose out of the success of the lippo bank unlike just about all other banks in indonesia its founder mochtar riady tended to shun the suharto connections that for other conglomerates in indonesia were the keys to success
3981340 he avoided lending to politically connected groups or to state enterprises and instead built his business on legitimate retail and trade finance
3981341 li ka shing is an investor in the riady familys hong kong china bank
3981342 the lippo group has a strategic position in china and hong kong with substantial investments and relationships with powerful business and government people and organisations
3981343 it owns 49 of the hong kong chinese bank with the remaining 51 held by china resources holdings which is a wholly owned enterprise of chinas ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation

3981348 right now ive talked to joe silva quite a few times and were looking at maybe january he has told me its going to be matt serra so im looking at january or february thatll give my knee plenty of time to heal if it heals natural if i have to go under the knife i dont know what my time frame will be but well see right now were looking like january
3981349 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3981350 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3981351 there will be broad condemnation of it as idiotic but i dont think it will injure the olympic brand
3981352 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3981353 the slowdown in demand coupled with the increase in businesses non wage costs is likely to put downward pressure on employment growth
3981354 this is the weakest set of labour market data since the economic slowdown began employment growth has ebbed to a trickle indeed employment has fallen in several regions of the country while the rise in unemployment is gaining worrying momentum
3981355 the figures are a tragedy and hide the misery for tens of thousands of households where people lose their jobs we have been warning for months about a downturn in the economy and i fear there are more job losses to come particularly in food manufacturing where thousands of workers are being made redundant
3981356 until now low unemployment has helped sustain the belief that there might be a soft landing in the housing market without large scale repossessions but it is now clear that a prolonged slowdown is going to reproduce many of the bad conditions of the early 1990s
3981357 it wasnt very good offensively but the defense took advantage of turnovers so believe what you see im really happy with what our defense did
3981358 the defense brought a whole lot of blitzes so what i have to do is make my decisions faster and be more precise
3981359 if option no 1 isnt there hit no 2 real quick because someones coming these are things i can put in the memory bank and take into the season
3981360 and i dont really have too many live snaps its good for both of us to know that im not made of glass that i can get hit and its good for the team to know that i can take a hit and bounce back
3981361 its a real honor that the team would elect me captain
3981362 they know i havent played a whole lot but i think it displays the confidence that they have in me and it feels really good
3981363 the freshman year is a year of adjustment sometimes and hes showing some maturity

3981368 vince has been our go to guy for the last few years he had two balls in his hands so he had to catch it
3981369 yeah its finally starting to click thats what i was looking for so that i could start to play faster and show people what i was capable of
3981370 i think as a veteran sometimes you have a tendency to think you know everything i think maybe i was a little guilty of that at first but i had to go back to the basics i had to go over the playbook more go over the plays more spend more time with the coaches and learn from the veterans that have been here and its helped me more each and every day
3981371 hes become one of the leaders on the defense not that he wasnt last year
3981372 but moreso just going into the second year and going into the second year knowing what hes doing as opposed to feeling like ive got to learn this ive got to learn that
3981373 you couldnt reason with them they were yelling and screaming and whacking me in the head
3981374 id probably be dead or in a coma right now
3981375 i felt good while i was having the race but my race was the first one of the day if this event was held later on i had the chance set to a better time
3981376 for the last 50m i was slower than i thought but all in all i think i had a good race i thought i could set 2 06 but i guess i was being greedy before the race
3981377 i was so calm that i think i could have seen each face in this venue i enjoyed my race
3981378 im glad that phelpss not a breaststroke specialist to give it to you frankly
3981379 hes a fabulous swimmer with great technique but hes not suited to breaststroke i think hes more of a freestyle guy

3981388 the experience and the friendships that i made thats what i miss
3981389 if anything not making this team and having to report it has made me hungrier and more focused to be playing

3981401 im sick of this guys i feel like right now emmett freshwater is our mayor
3981402 i think the real mayor of carnegie should be sitting at the council table not the pretend one
3981403 that left us in a quandary as to who the mayor should be
3981404 those two people who just left ms freshwater and councilman fred carini are holding you back
3981405 as far as building goes this year has definitely been the slowest

3981408 i dont see an increase to get back to that late 1990s to early 2000s level
3981409 i think its going to level out to where its at now
3981410 we had our big boom here in the 90s commercially
3981411 in the past you would see 25 to 30 homes a year in each plan and theyre all probably doing 10 to 15 homes a year now
3981412 its giving us a chance to take a breath and make some plans for the future
3981413 we have a little bit more time now for everything

3981416 i can put myself in their shoes and feel the excitement all over again
3981417 the games are still very competitive across the board in all sports

3981426 the times are all so much faster now and the rules have changed we didnt have the butterfly in the olympics then either
3981427 we went swimming every day thats when i got the bug
3981428 once we started going especially when we made the big team we were there every day at 7 a m before school and at 4 p m after school
3981429 that was too bad because she was right on my tail all the time we had a friendly rivalry
3981430 i didnt know if it was a rumor or actually true
3981431 i never in the world expected to be there i had just had a good swimming day
3981432 there was quite a crowd in the middle of the night the whole town knew about it
3981433 we were nervous about her we didnt want her to start swimming
3981434 there wasnt anything that occurred that she could be suing over
3981435 just a power of the wills it was very authoritative on both parts
3981436 you had a duty as the captain of this plane to call the police and you didnt do it
3981437 christopaganism is a neopagan syncretic tradition that blends elements taken from both neopaganism and christianity christopagans usually refuse the christian conception of god as a transcendent entity that rules the world from an extrauniversal place and they accept the pagan idea of god viewed as an immanent entity that can be identified with the nature the life the existence and the entire universe christopagans also include in their doctrine the belief in jesus and only in his teachings but jesus is not seen as god on the earth but on the contrary as a wise and mystic human during their rituals christopagans worship jesus god and the nature in all its forms because after all the nature is god
3981438 he knew there were new dna analysis techniques that we could use with the evidence to possibly bring this to an end

3981441 the sea should make sure that somebody takes the lead on this and is responsible for the final approval if its design if its architectural if its engineering
3981442 its hard to place an 8 year old dog so thats great
3981443 so far it has been a wonderful help and were just so grateful
3981444 i try to pick ones i think will react well to being passed around
3981445 but this is also a way to help us out
3981446 we need to get the word out that if city residents lose a dog or a cat they should come here right away
3981447 trucks roll in constantly and we get thousands of animals
3981448 can the chairman let the department director answer the question
3981449 lack of civility we cannot insult women at the table to ask for a gender equity study
3981450 unfortunate that the president of council behaved like he did its not the first time in public or private
3981451 what we most hope will happen when city council gets together on monday is that everybody will have taken a deep breath and council and the mayors office can find a way to fund the study
3981452 its a safer deal we can sleep better at night
3981453 a lot of innocent people will be hurt a lot of jobs will be lost and a lot of revenue and its going to be an eyesore
3981454 i think its going to be good for the region its up to the gaming board now to go through and vet all those issues and get it in writing
3981455 not intended to provide an open fair and objective public process but instead to speedily cover its tracks
3981456 this environment that has surrounded the change in ownership has given the distinct impression that this decision is a fait accompli especially given the behind the scenes lobbying by prominent elected officials
3981457 this is not an inside job of any sort people came to us because the project was in financial trouble we happened to have been vetted greg carlin and i and we happened to have the financial resources to get it going the equity thats desperately needed
3981458 it was most exciting to come through the locks and dam and see the discovery and our staff with their fresh new riverquest shirts and the yachts with friends and family cheering us on
3981459 we made a victory tour up the rivers a vision becoming a reality is very satisfying
3981460 making it a green boat added a million to the cost
3981461 i think the boat is symbolic of the transformation of pittsburgh and i hope the community embraces it and sees pittsburgh in a way the world sees it
3981462 we dont act like adults we act like kids we get down to their level
3981463 there are kids who you know have a medical condition and need medication at school but you dont have their medication
3981464 then i have medication that i cant give to them because i dont have a doctors note
3981465 i want to get everything in order to let the teachers know then there is the regular stuff such as nose bleeds
3981466 they have to have an open inviting personality it speaks for the atmosphere of the school
3981467 thats what they see first they are a model for the children
3981468 i saw a lot of smiling faces lots of kids ready to go back to school
3981469 its going to be a broadly participatory project engaging as many citizens as possible in envisioning the future of the region
3981470 its about developing shared goals for the region what we want to be and aspire to
3981471 what is the road map we aspire to and how will we get there
3981472 it could be education health culture the subject matter is much more open to what people say they want to do
3981473 theres no reason if we do it really well and the technology is available not to involve tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands and involve them meaningfully in this process
3981474 the region isnt just pittsburgh or allegheny county or even southwestern pennsylvania its broader than that
3981475 we have a shared history economy culture pittsburgh is the capital of that broad region
3981476 i have contacted many members of the westmoreland county republican committee and there is overwhelming support for ms ward myself included
3981477 after much thought and consideration and many calls asking me to enter the partys nomination process to replace sen regola i have decided to do so
3981478 but this unexpected turn of events and outpouring of calls of encouragement from friends and strangers has led me to believe it is something that needed to be done
3981479 with great doubts about whether or not their interests are being represented in harrisburg
3981480 according to the law this doesnt rise to a crime
3981481 why dont you get your boyfriend to bite it off you
3981482 i bet your boyfriend would like to take that off
3981483 i can understand you dont want him to be a teacher
3981484 i thought about this on a thursday and on monday i was open for business
3981485 i hear people say dont throw that away take it to the shop
3981486 its not usually a problem because if we get a couch its gone the same day
3981487 the one thing we can never get enough of is dishes pots and pans bowls and glasses
3981488 has been a blessing i used to be on the street not homeless but out doing things i shouldnt i was never the kind of person who was used to dealing with people and this shop has helped me tolerate different types its been a big help to me
3981489 the no strings shop is the stuff all my grandkids have things from here id be lost without it
3981490 if she thought there was abuse it would be easy for us to tighten things up
3981491 this is a resident driven effort and the fact that we have a group of residents assisting other residents is a gem and a godsend for us
3981492 there are opportunities for resident owned businesses but i think for them its giving back something they do from the kindness of their hearts
3981493 people come from all over and they donate from all over
3981494 but i never had any dream about doing this it was just an idea that made sense

3981503 my people on vulcan have been playing this game for ages

3981511 at the end of the year i send a report to the state and give larry a copy
3981512 i go every two weeks to converse with larry and i hear from him if we get a customer complaint
3981513 im lucky if i get two or three a year
3981514 the customer didnt feel they are getting the proper amount of fuel
3981515 i test once a year unless there is a complaint
3981516 i dont do too many in one day because of the fumes if you have a windy day it comes back up at you
3981517 that way there are enough for him to find because they get mixed in

3981519 i have over 900 of them but i dont have this one
3981520 by the 1920s leon trotsky had been labeled by stalin as an enemy of the soviet state he had all memory of leon eliminated after trotskys exile turning leon into what has subsequently been called the annihilated shadow
3981521 trotsky ended up being almost like stalins imaginary friend you know that imaginary friend some of us had as kids the one you could blame stuff on
3981522 there is absolutely no denying de camp made the cimmeria dark valley connection before me not acknowledging this fact the anteriority of the link not the so called borrowing was an editorial decision on my part de camp was not gonna be in this book period
3981523 by the time robert entered the cross plains high school howard was a large powerful youth when fully grown he was 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighed around 200 pounds most of it muscle
3981524 photographs of robert show him as an unscarred well fed and not terribly muscular young man
3981525 an excessive devotion to his mother proved to be his achilles heel
3981526 howards use of poetical style is well documented by nearly everyone whos written critically of the man in the past two decades even de camp noted it
3981527 s amp s provides the reader with a heroic model with whom he for a moment can identify himself
3981528 as far as entertainment goes i cant see anything wrong with this though i still dislike the over emphasis on violence
3981529 apologists of this kind of entertainment trace its development back through eric rucker eddison and lord dunsany to william morris but in fact it is not even the debilitated offspring of these sagas but rather a misbegotten child of our own technological civilization offering a quick escape from an oppressive world
3981530 this kind of fiction commonly called sword amp sorcery by its fans is not fantasy at its lowest but it still has a tacky feel
3981531 the only writer who really got away with this sort of stuff was robert e howard
3981532 howard overcame the limitations of his puerile material by the force and fury of his writing
3981533 yet his other work was either unremarkable or just abysmal
3981534 i can be president this idea has potential for a viral campaign among moms it is about your sons and daughters believing that they too can be president your success paves the way for them it is about the emotional connection between you and their dreams for the kids especially their daughters we are making a video with celebrities saying what they would do if president the launch of this has good potential to catch on
3981535 based on what im looking at here its going to take up 12 18 months to get there

3981575 were disappointed life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we end up
3981576 this decision flies in the face of the motion adopted by parliament on june 3 2008 which calls on the government to allow us war resisters to apply for permanent resident status in canada
3981577 it deportation also rejects the will of canadians who have demonstrated in various polls that they want war resisters to stay

3981583 unfortunately well see more of this in austin and its people who overpaid for their properties or expanded too rapidly theres more pain ahead for probably the next six to eight months
3981584 we were seeing the writing on the wall in terms of the capital market changing nationally with capital for projects drying up and regulators being more harsh on lending institutions
3981585 the reason that was given to us was that they were never able to get an equity partner committed to the project
3981586 and we have been told by a handful of other potential buyers that they are all having the same problem of securing an equity partner in this current market climate
3981587 very viable location particularly with gas as expensive as it is though perhaps not necessarily for condos currently but possibly for office or medical condos
3981588 has some significant issues related to topography and tree preservation that make the cost of construction very high the high construction cost resulted in a higher sales price which put the project in competition with some of the downtown projects thus limiting the marketability and its sales potential which eventually led to the foreclosure
3981589 is related more to the specifics of the project and to the overall slowdown in residential sales and does not necessarily indicate the beginning of a trend in foreclosures
3981590 its a dynamic time for our organization and our art form
3981591 his art really speaks to people on a direct emotional level because although its simple in form it has a lot of emotional meaning

3981609 eine der wichtigsten fragen der neurowissenschaften heute ist wie kommt man von der aktivit t einzelner nervenzellen zu komplexen verhaltensweisen

3981621 das ergebnis ist in ordnung doch die verletzung von farfan wirkt sehr schwer er hat sich vermutlich eine schultereckgelenkssprengung zugezogen zudem sind wohl ein paar b nder kaputt

3981628 i did have some compensation for not pursuing a teaching career because i taught sunday school
3981629 i said i would help out until they got someone and there i was 20 years later but i loved it
3981630 when i was a very small child i use to sit with my dad when trainers use to sit around the oval
3981631 and i remember our house being opened to solly players and supporters for many after match parties when i would play the pianola at five years old my feet barely reaching the pedals
3981632 i know he would have been so very proud of me
3981633 i spent so much time at the club my dad often said that i should take my bed there
3981634 i did a bit of everything and for 15 years worked at the front desk in customer services
3981635 i have worked in technical services and at the tourism and arts centre and at one time was the secretary to the ceo
3981636 i have seen some huge changes during my time at council which includes eight different chief executive officers
3981637 i started working in the offices in the town hall and in 1981 we moved to new offices where the council chambers are now situated
3981638 during my 40 years there have been three different amalgamations which created a bigger workload more staff and the need to extend the council offices
3981639 that was a very different experience but a real challenge
3981640 there is not much i dont know about council administration and i was once told i could write a book
3981641 we had only recently updated and redone all our security but at the end of the day if someone wants to get in they will
3981642 four people who did the clean up on sunday were quite angry
3981643 there has been about 2500 worth of damage so we will have a full week of quotes and repairs for us
3981644 the hall was hired out on sunday so the group had to find another venue
3981645 every single hour is put in by volunteers for the good of the community and all of this was destroyed for the sake of a few dollars
3981646 we would also like to encourage clubs to do their own security audits

3981653 volunteers are an essential part of a community therefore recruiting training and sustaining them is vital
3981654 enhancing public awareness and perception of volunteering is important and delivering the message that a community will have something that will interest any person who wishes to become a volunteer
3981655 the biggest motivator is keeping volunteers utilised and well organised
3981656 the organisation must ensure that their time is respected and recognised
3981657 it is important to provide details of support services in your region and form a partnership with agencies to find out the local needs
3981658 natch plead ing with the melbourne legislature to no avail
3981659 a brisk well told science fiction adventure set in the normally unadventurous world of business
3981660 it was another successful and great fun night with nearly 200 attendees and we were thrilled to have raised 3636
3981661 ive been through both sides of the coin when youve won super bowls and when youve lost super bowls and sometimes its harder to put it behind you when youve won it
3981662 you think that you dont need to work anymore you think that youve got it all figured out but after an unsuccessful season the fire is burning even more
3981663 you look back on last year and we did a lot of great things that was a disappointing finish one way or the other it doesnt make any difference were into 2008 and our focus is on this year
3981664 well look back with mixed feelings on last year but it doesnt really matter
3981665 i was rooting for the patriots to win the super bowl
3981666 i wanted to be a witness to history with an undefeated team i was with them
3981667 even being a player you become a fan its very rare you see history made especially in this game
3981668 from a fan standpoint it was marvelous this is my 10th year in the league and i never thought anybody would go undefeated in the regular season then once they got to the playoffs there was just an anticipation of if they could do it
3981669 realistically i probably wouldnt have thought they would i thought they were probably a playoff team
3981670 you always have emotions when watching it because you remember the disappointment you felt after the game just like when you watch games you have won you remember the excitement you felt
3981671 it was one game last season that we all felt we could have played a little better you cant change what happened as hard as you want to you cant so what can you do you can move forward with the awareness that you can improve
3981672 you improve by winning it all which we didnt do last year
3981673 you improve by finishing what we started and you improve by continuing to build your team toward the future as well
3981674 theres a lot of things we can do better that we need to do better
3981675 we can use it as a training tool and a way to get better and to learn from our mistakes but were moving on from that
3981676 our jobs are determined by alignments and it really doesnt matter who is out there in front of you you just have to get the job done
3981677 i think its disrespectful to the giants their defensive line their front seven and their coaching staff they did a tremendous job that day they really did
3981678 you try to retain your own players but you know the way things are in this league there are going to be changes
3981679 most of the offers were more than it was here but ive had my big contract
3981680 this is my 10th year in the league and it really wasnt about the money
3981681 i looked at all my options and this suited me best especially with the opportunities here
3981682 im just trying to be a sponge and learn from the older guys
3981683 hopefully when my name is called ill be prepared to go out and make some plays
3981684 the physical abilities of all three of them are obvious
3981685 the speed of mayo the quickness of guyton crables length those are physical attributes but the thing i like is their attitude they are willing to accept the many things that we are asking them to do
3981686 you lose it there were down days in the beginning but you put those behind you very quickly because what weve done a good job of around here is when weve won a lot of games is suppress success weve always looked on to whats next
3981687 in the end of the second set when i was close to winning the match got a little out of hand
3981688 but even after losing the second set i didnt panic
3981689 when you win 15 matches in a row he must be feeling pretty good about himself
3981690 just to not make him play especially when i was serving for that first set
3981691 obviously the guy has as much confidence as anybody playing tennis today
3981692 ill have to do everything i can to disrupt his flow
3981693 set point for him match point for me it went so long there were long rallies and some amazing balls

3981696 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3981697 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3981698 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3981699 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3981700 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3981701 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3981702 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3981703 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3981720 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3981721 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3981722 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3981723 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3981727 field position is huge when you get in the numbers and statistics about when you get to certain parts of the field you learn it helps your offense a lot any way i can help us become more productive is something ill be jumping on and willing to do
3981728 theres seven of them all the fast ones that can catch one of the problems is youve got too many on a team like ours
3981729 i look at the list and there are 12 that we sit there and look at youve got to get it down to three probably that you can use and if you have some tough luck and have more injuries that list grows
3981730 you want to see who can catch punts and who can catch kickoffs and at the same time their coaches are constantly pulling them to get them back to their drills so its really a tough thing to make sure that you get to watch the guys because youve got to watch the guy catch it in live snaps
3981731 no im not going to want to come off the field thats just me
3981732 i definitely take pride in all those special teams plays i take pride in the team and doing whatever it is to help the team its just another way to help us win
3981733 im 10 times better back there you can grow every game
3981734 its about catching a fair catch and not letting a ball roll to the 1 its setting up different blocks its honoring the number part of it and knowing those statistics about scoring chances from the 30 40 50 and trying to get there to make it happen
3981735 we will see later how useful and easy it is to imbricate forms

3981743 we had a tough time as our train moved at a slow pace and halted at the smallest of stations
3981744 i am waiting for any train towards surat after four hours of waiting i cancelled my ticket and returned to the hotel
3981745 the railway authorities waived the cancellation charges considering the situation
3981746 i am not sure if after three hours the train will depart or not
3981747 we realised that candidates had to wait for hours before they could get through to their roll numbers to see their scores we had put this on a trial run in cat 2007 as well and got a very good response so we decided to introduce this in the cat bulletin
3981748 at the time of results our official website is literally bombaeded by not only candidates but their friends family and coaching centres trying to get a chance to view the score the rush makes the website slower and thus we are also in the process of revamping the website so it can take the load better

3981752 i feel like i get paid to be a baseball fan which i dont think everyone can say about their job
3981753 i have never really had an interest in sales or in selling a product
3981754 i was fearful for some time of what sales was because i could not relate it to me suddenly have to be some sort of salesperson the naturally outdoing arrogant self righteous type that i didnt think i was
3981755 not until i learned that sales is about honest human relationships and literally selling or being a fan of something im a fan of anyhow did i ever get into sales
3981756 i never put much thought into what school meant what a job was how everything fit together
3981757 the most advanced thought i ever pondered in relation to sports was to be some type of sports journalist and even that wasnt until quite late
3981758 once i realized that every pro team is backed by an intricate operating system the sports journalist thing seemed like my only way into sports if i wasnt going to play on the field growing up i know for sure a veterinarian was always a recurring idea for a career
3981759 took a chance and went to philadelphia thats when i realized i needed to get going with some real plans
3981760 my dad glenn and i more or less accidentally discovered ohio state university as a place where they had what looked like a good graduate program
3981761 and i remember my mom peggy telling me i should get a masters degree because as she said thats what it seems everyone is doing these days
3981762 part of the reason i was inclined to leave texas was the grind of being what amounted to fourth place in a four team marketplace
3981763 you had the dallas cowboys the dallas mavericks and the dallas stars all making the playoffs seemingly year to year all drawing the majority of the attention
3981764 here in washington d c id bet were about to lock in at no 2 of the four spots here
3981765 were behind the redskins of the nfl but were more exciting and promising than the wizards nba and the capitals nhl
3981766 i never have to look far to be reminded that i am part of something very special to a whole lot of people we like to say things like national pastime in the nations capital and that seem to get to me every time to truly reflect on what that means
3981767 all professional things aside i really enjoy the d c area there are lots of fellow go getters who are fun to interact with and i get to have four seasons and fall colors again i think my favorite places in this country offer the big city feel during the week but with outlets to go hiking or be near water on the weekends
3981768 the security guard approached me asked me to step aside made me completely do a turn around while he stared me up and down and then asked me to leave because my outfit was too provocative and peoples husbands were looking at me
3981769 the article of clothing that she is trying to pull off as a dress is actually a top
3981770 we have a dress code here if you are coming here to shop today and you come in wearing a top with no pants then we are going to ask you to leave
3981771 girls are always buying shirts as dresses it depends really on your height whether you can pull it off
3981772 i have shorts to be honest that are completely worse than this dress

3981776 the next item that will probably be sold on ebay at a start price of 99c and of course with no reserve
3981777 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
3981778 ebay does connect colourful buyers with colourful sellers and i wouldnt be surprised if someone did buy these items though i couldnt speculate on who would buy them or why
3981779 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage

3981822 its a tricky business and it requires a lot of close followup

3981824 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late
3981825 we try to be pre emptive when we start tightening and pre emptive when we start easing
3981826 there is little doubt that the significant decline in inflationary expectations in august is associated with the steep fall in crude oil prices over the last month
3981827 this fall will also place downward pressure on the september quarter cpi reducing the possibility of further rate rises and providing some scope for future interest rate relief
3981828 the recent significant drop in the new zealand dollar over the last few weeks will no doubt give exporting manufacturers a competitive advantage which may encourage further activity in the months ahead
3981829 in contrast on the domestic front demand remains lackluster and with ongoing rising costs for key raw materials and petrol still evident many manufacturers are still finding day to day business operations a challenge

3981833 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
3981834 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
3981835 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
3981836 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
3981837 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
3981838 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
3981839 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
3981840 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional memory become unbound during sleep
3981841 calling all designers developers information architects project managers writers editors marketers and everyone else who makes websites it is time once again to pool our information so as to begin sketching a true picture of the way our profession is practiced worldwide
3981842 there is no one but us there never has been there have been generations which remembered and generations which forgot there has never been a generation of whole men and women who lived well for even one day yet some have imagined well with honesty and art the detail of such a life and have described it with such grace that we mistake vision for history dream for description and fancy that life has devolved so you learn this studying any history at all especially the lives of artists and visionaries you learn it from emerson who noticed that the meanness of our days is itself worth our thought and you learn it fitful in your pew at church

3981856 i have a feeling unfortunately because of the time needed to train im going to be missing the next affliction fight in october but i anticipate getting back in the gym soon and being ready for the next affliction show after the october show
3981857 certainly one of the main topics was the possibility of having a fight together and the realities that we both face mainly that he faces and whether the reality of having a fight can happen in the near future
3981858 of course he cant deal with us because he cant deal with anybody

3981868 im very pleased that finally justice has been done mainly for my soldiers because it was them who actually fought face to face with the enemy mr smith said
3981869 they fought over and above what would be expected of young national service soldiers with very little experience he said
3981870 they repelled wave after wave of assaulting suicidal attacks and not one of the enemy got inside our position thanks to them
3981871 it was just sad that we lost 18 soldiers that day
3981872 its good to see a situation where we are now getting some justice with respect to these long standing issues he said

3981891 political pollsters would like us to believe theyve got a bead on voter preference for sen barack obama and john mccain with regard to who is likely to win the presidency in novembers general election this sort of thing is of course their stock in trade
3981892 the fact remains that the 4 to 10 point leads polls have been reporting for the last month or so dont mean anything with respect to the election and are far enough within the margins for error to give pause at this stage of the game acknowledging this even the overwhelmingly pro obama
3981893 it also appears and i tend to believe this based on reader mail that some savvy individuals who had leaned toward obama actually decided to do some cursory research on the candidate
3981894 that he is not what he seems has indeed become apparent to some likely voters to these he is becoming more transparent
3981895 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky and did i mention hes black

3981964 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community to help the poverty hit afghan people

3981966 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001

3981968 we still have diplomatic relations with georgia we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia
3981969 but we wont directly talk to saakashvili we wont do that we offered him peace but not friendship
3981970 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3981971 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict
3981972 you can argue that it was the highlight of his career he had been treading water for eight or 10 years
3981973 he said he was fearful of doing television because aside from the ed sullivan exposure television had been a fiasco for him
3981974 this is supposed to be the informal part of the show where we faint or do whatever we want to do especially me
3981975 because he hadnt been touring he had gotten into the movie thing i know his feeling was im getting back before the public this way

3981988 we are prima facie of the view that the plea of loss of confidence taken by the ongc in the petitioners for having failed to furnish the performance guarantee appears to be justifiable deserving credence
3981989 there is now far too much on the table particularly for developing countries to give up on these negotiations
3981990 this is trying to rewrite history this serves as the benchmark to resume negotiations
3981991 hes been throwing the ball pretty well and obviously we like the guy because we traded for him
3981992 hes a big league hitter and hes become a very good situational hitter
3981993 and i think the other thing that hes done the last couple of months is work the count in his favor hes not afraid to spit on pitches and hes not reluctant to hit with two strikes i think thats the sign of a guy that is real confident
3981994 we played sometimes against them and we know each other very well
3981995 im very happy to meet germany in the next game
3981996 the olympics isnt any ordinary competition theres definitely more pressure
3981997 i didnt play to my full potential but it was good training for me psychologically
3981998 when i was behind 1 0 and even when i was trailing in the second game to be able to come back from that psychologically that was good for me i think itll be helpful for the upcoming games
3981999 for a player its not the greatest feeling sitting in the stands watching the team play in a must win game
3982000 i hope this never happens to me ever again i want to be on the field helping the guys out i felt bad
3982001 freddy had a good tournament he has a good mentality and a very good future in the team
3982002 he needs to establish himself he needs to play because with every single game he got better
3982003 i think hes grown a lot hes been through a lot of those trying times and i think he has a good grasp on what he should and shouldnt do
3982004 he comes to play hard he come up with big hits
3982005 you take a young pitching staff and put it up against the boston red sox and they are a team that knows how to make you work and knows how to take advantage of mistakes
3982006 now hes confident hes attacking the zone it makes it a lot easier for us behind him
3982007 we just rest up lie on our beds and try not to get too excited
3982008 we arent used to being fresh and ready to race really we are always at that certain level of fatigue especially being on the road its quite weird and the boredom is a bit of a problem
3982009 i just want to concentrate on the one thing i dont want to risk maybe riding the individual being tired for the team and coming away with two silvers or two bronzes we want to go away and win the gold
3982010 this is a key role in new zealands trade diplomacy completion of the doha negotiations in geneva and implementation of the results remains our top trade priority
3982011 new zealands dependence on agricultural exports means that the wtos system of trade rules and dispute settlement has crucial importance for us
3982012 the hurdles to democracy that the two parties put out in front of you are so onerous that third parties are learning to cooperate
3982013 he has not shown that the u s has either as a matter of deliberate policy or official indiffernce required or allowed its combatants to engage in widespread actions in violation of humanitarian law
3982014 no matter how much i wanted to i could not convince myself that killing someone was right
3982015 i have already missed a large chunk of my young sons life and i was willing to sacrifice any more lost time with him especially during his formative years
3982016 because it is an act of aggression with no defensive basis it has been supported by pretenses that cannot withstand even elementary scrutiny first before the u s dropped the first bomb it was quite evident that iraq had no weapons of mass destruction second the bush administration had the gall to exploit the american publics fear of terrorists by making the absurd assertion that a secular batthist government was working with a fundamentalist terrorist group there was nevery any intelligence to substantiate this third the notion that the u s wants to export democracy to iraq is laughable democracy is by the people not an appointed puppet theater
3982017 a u s soldier who deserted his iraq bound regiment and sought asylum in canada said the u s war in iraq was illegal and he accused the united states of committing war crimes pfc jeremy hinzman 25 is believed to be the first u s soldier to apply for refugee status in canada after refusing combat duty in iraq
3982018 i was told in basic training that if im given an illegal or immoral order it is my duty to disobey it
3982019 whether a country lives under freedom or tyranny or whatever else thats the collective responsibility of the people of that country
3982020 this is a very disappointing decision it puts canada more fully in complicity with an illegal and immoral war jeremy will probably end up back here at fort bragg thats usually what happens
3982021 i applied for conscientious objector status in the u s army because i realized that i cannot kill a fellow humna being but my application was denied i knew that in iraq i would be ordered to take part in combat operations or other actions that are against my principles
3982022 nga and i knew canada had welcomed many americans like us during the vietnam war and we knew canada had refused to join the invasion of iraq
3982023 sending jeremy and his family back to the u s where he would face harsh punishment would be cruel
3982024 it would fly in the face of the motion adopted by the house of commons on june 3 which called on the harper government to stop all deportation proceedings against these conscientious objectors
3982025 jeremy hinzman 29 had filed for a pre removal risk assessment and permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds with citizenship and immigration canada in january after several prior failed attempts to gain refugee status today he was told that both of those applications had been rejected and he must leave the country by sept 23
3982026 obviously were disappointed but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we end up
3982027 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed
3982028 robidoux said hinzman who lives in toronto with his wife and two children plans to take a close look at the decisions before deciding how to proceed
3982029 federal ndp citizenship and immigration critic olivia chow who put foward the june 3rd parliament motion called the decision to expell jeremy mean spirited she called on citizenship and immigration minister diane finley to hald the deporation of hinzman and other resisters immediately
3982030 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
3982031 these refugees have an uncertain status they are referred to as guests not refugees and year long residency permits are hard to obtain the vast majority were granted short stays in the country which since 2005 have become virtually impossible to renew without official paperwork the refugees are not allowed to work
3982032 are being sold for sex there is a large sex trade in young iraqi girls in the nighclubs of damascus fourteen and fifteen year olds literally girls not even women yet and even children are being sold
3982033 they have been great to me but i will no longer be involved with the pageant due to the fact that i really couldnt take it when i saw all those refugees in syria being mistreated seing these people suffer made me ashamed i dont deserve to live in a classy apartment while other women are selling themselves what kind of sick demented human being would want to have sex with a 10 year old
3982034 annual government budget in iraq exceeds 70 billion us dollars where is that money going power cuts are long people get electricity for only an hour or two a day water is cut off as well
3982035 u s lawmakers appropriated 8 5 billion to train and equip iraqs security forces in 2007 and 2008 of that sum roughly 457 million went to the iraqi air force
3982036 t he bad news is that 12 000 people represent a tiny fraction of the vast exodus of iraqis driven from their homes by the violence and ethnic cleansing unleashed by the 2003 u s invasion estimates of their number vary the widely used figure of 5 million is about one in five to get that into context relative to the size of the population it would equal the forced displacement of almost 60 million americans
3982037 at the end of july european countries decided to halt the processing of accepting new refugees and to postpone until september discussions about those who submitted their requests for refugee status the decision does not stem only from concern over the growth in the number of iraqis in europe and an increase in the muslim element on the continent but primarily against the backdrop of iraqi preime minister nuri request to stop absorbing refugees al maliki explained to european heads of state and interior ministers he met with that the situation in iraq has improved and iraq needs its refugees in order to rebuild the state
3982038 the district commissioner of al multaqa district abdul kareem ali nasif and three of his guards were wounded by a suicide car bomb that targeted the convoy of nasif while he was going to his office district in al multaqa district west of kirkuk early morning
3982039 abdul karim al jubouri also leads pro u s security vonteer forces in the area was wounded along with three bodyguards
3982040 he tried to head towards us but we were careful because suicidal attackers are common in diyala

3982044 when they are holding the card even when they see the logo that creates a momentary craving
3982045 those who were holding the credit cards were bidding about twice as high as the cash people

3982047 you ultimately would save more in the long run getting an energy efficient or energy star refrigerator that will use less electricity over 10 or 15 years
3982048 people get out of the habit of going dont like it
3982049 had they gone by the month even though it was slightly more expensive per month that would have been more economical
3982050 free is a magic word and many of the marketing tricks are crafted around that desire
3982051 i guess i should warn you if i turn out to be particularly clear youve probably misunderstood what i said
3982052 advertisers are provided both the number of impressions they can expect to get with their purchase along with real time updates on their ads performance

3982054 well if you have an email account over gmail web or freenet you already have a jabber account just configure it in konqueror elseway you can just register to a jabber account inside konqueror
3982055 wow that was easy heres my account name xxx xxx xx
3982056 my keyboard and synthesizers have a nice pile of dust on top of their covers
3982057 the enormously expensive construction of new wind turbines and the vast extension of the national electrical grid that will be required
3982058 if the senate does conduct an additional review it is essential its terms of reference are broad ranging to achieve real outcomes for indigenous australians
3982059 we have to take the politics out of this debate
3982060 in order to achieve a lasting impact a review by the senate would need to consider historical funding arrangements for indigenous services since 1978
3982061 it would need to assess the backlog in health education housing and infrastructure and determine whether commonwealth funding support is adequate
3982062 cabinet will look at what further measures will be possible to reduce the pressure on a system
3982063 there is much much more to be done and we are working hard on this
3982064 the core reason for the pressure on the system being we are in the middle of an appallingly low level of rainfall and i cant make it rain
3982065 you cant turn the queen mary around to be sailing in a particular direction for the last 12 years in six months
3982066 maybe they were preoccupied with other life issues or selfish or stupid or stubborn
3982067 if your normal happy go lucky 12 year old child cant walk unaided for a period of weeks screams in pain cant shower wet and soils herself in her clothes if no one helps her to the toilet cries in the night and cant walk the next day you shouldnt need any medical training to have worked out that she is a very very sick young girl
3982068 the standard of care was not breached in this case
3982069 all of the foundation of the crown case is simply false i am asking you ladies and gentleman to put an end to all of this just end it for gods sake and allow her ms reynolds to grieve
3982070 if it is your view that facs should have done more well perhaps they should have
3982071 perhaps they should have done a lot more before this day
3982072 george washington long ago warned america against entangling alliances and he was right
3982073 russia and georgia risk falling into a full scale war in which the u s can and hopefully will avoid any involvement but had georgia been a member of nato we would now be risking a full scale confrontation with nuclear armed russia
3982074 obviously america should encourage both countries to back down and resolve their differences peacefully
3982075 the status of south ossetia as well as abkhazia another russian supported separatist zone within georgia matters a lot more to russia on which the two territories border than to the u s moreover washington itself set a precedent for russia when it intervened in kosovo a decade ago attacking serbia to win independence for the separatist ethnic albanian majority
3982076 we should not create or expand alliances where the u s does not have vital interests if the europeans want to defend distant countries like georgia they can do so after all the european union has a larger population and bigger gdp than america without any of washingtons other global military commitments it is time for europe to accept responsibility for its own security
3982077 any war is tragic but not every war requires american intervention
3982078 we can do our best to mediate between russia and georgia but we should avoid any military involvement it is time to put the defense of america back into americas defense policy
3982079 its difficult to imagine a circumstance where the government could directly control interest rates without a whole range of adverse consequences occurring a whole range of other things mr tanner told abc radio
3982080 weve seen it in the past for example where we had a cap on interest rates
3982081 what that meant was that people ended up with cocktail loans for their homes where they borrowed a proportion of their mortgage at the official interest rate and had to borrow the rest at a really high interest rate much much higher than the official rate
3982082 now i wouldnt speculate about what they might be and of course its not my direct responsibility mr tanner said
3982083 well cross that bridge if and when we come to it if we believe that the banks are not doing the right thing then clearly we will be examining the options to put greater pressure on

3982178 collaboration with besang on 3d ic development demonstrates the expert technical capability of nnfc and the commercialization of emerging semiconductor technologies we expect that besangs breakthrough 3d ic technology will provide ultimate low cost and high performance solutions for the semiconductor industry
3982179 i am pleased that besangs 3d ic development is the first success story of excellent collaboration and technology exchange between snf and nnfc
3982180 one of unique features of besangs 3d ic is the capability of unrestricted 3d interconnections using conventional via technologies that does not require wafer alignment nor through silicon vias for 3d interconnects
3982181 conventional cmos technology is facing its scaling limits therefore this emerging 3d ic technology will extend the lifespan of cmos technology because it is an excellent alternative way to accommodate more devices on a given wafer area
3982182 besangs 3d ic is a novel combination of short process steps formation of array blocks in 3d thin layer transfer using unique wafer bonding followed by low temperature processing
3982183 hence there is a high possibility for this breakthrough 3d ic to provide low cost manufacturing solutions for the semiconductor industry besangs 3d ic is a very attractive technology and one wonders why other companies have not thought about it however i always believe in the dynamics of small companies as my colleague dawon kahng and i worked as a small team within a large organization when we co invented the non volatile memory in 1967 at bell labs
3982184 we can imagine evolution of semiconductor technologies through 3d vertical stacking instead of conventional horizontal shrinking which is getting more expensive and facing ever more technical difficulties
3982185 for rapid wafer processing engineers at nnfc and students and staff members at snf reserved the tools for besang with such strong support from nnfc and snf besang has successfully reached this level of technology development in a very short time i would like to say special thanks to all at nnfc and snf

3982194 i also give another commitment if it is deemed necessary at the end of this process that there be a broader inquiry even a royal commission then we will have one
3982195 but first of all lets allow this inquiry to take its course its obviously producing some interesting information about the nature of the inspection regime and the issues that flow from that
3982196 i cant stop them from doing that but i think the general public can see pretty much what the objective is
3982197 its a work of art with no hidden function at all

3982206 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference

3982226 this year well finally have to start doing what we probably should have been doing all along thats carpooling not having so many cars going trying to ride together
3982227 thats more of a concern with the kids getting their homework done because theyre going to have to be leaving at 3 oclock and getting home at sometimes 11 oclock or midnight
3982228 so we dont because of the conference changes have students leaving the school any more than when they were in the badger overall we were able to work things out where the early releases would be about the same from last year
3982229 im hoping our spartan pride will carry through and support all our sports on away games but im sure it will have a factor in the travel especially with fuel costs i think that might be the single biggest factor when youre paying 3 75 to 4 a gallon to travel thats going to be a factor for some families
3982230 it puts us with teams that are more evenly matched with student athlete enrollment
3982231 were a division 3 football team and were playing against division 3 team
3982232 the balance of teams were going to be playing in conference and out of conference is a little better size wise than what we had before
3982233 a school of 650 kids is only going to have so many kids that want to play football
3982234 a school of 1 500 kids is obviously going to have more athletes or student athletes to choose from
3982235 you kind of have the same crop of kids to pick from
3982236 theres no doubt that in high school athletics a lot is based on rivalries
3982237 one thing we look forward to is making new rivalries
3982238 we have more than 300 students in sports out of 650 right now and we have sports that the rock valley doesnt offer so were in the badger conference for those

3982579 my apology to ralph nader for not demanding that he be included in the debates
3982580 he has not shown that the u s has either as a matter of deliberate policy or official indiffernce required or allowed its combatants to engage in widespread actions in violation of humanitarian law
3982581 no matter how much i wanted to i could not convince myself that killing someone was right
3982582 i have already missed a large chunk of my young sons life and i was willing to sacrifice any more lost time with him especially during his formative years
3982583 because it is an act of aggression with no defensive basis it has been supported by pretenses that cannot withstand even elementary scrutiny first before the u s dropped the first bomb it was quite evident that iraq had no weapons of mass destruction second the bush administration had the gall to exploit the american publics fear of terrorists by making the absurd assertion that a secular batthist government was working with a fundamentalist terrorist group there was nevery any intelligence to substantiate this third the notion that the u s wants to export democracy to iraq is laughable democracy is by the people not an appointed puppet theater
3982584 a u s soldier who deserted his iraq bound regiment and sought asylum in canada said the u s war in iraq was illegal and he accused the united states of committing war crimes pfc jeremy hinzman 25 is believed to be the first u s soldier to apply for refugee status in canada after refusing combat duty in iraq
3982585 i was told in basic training that if im given an illegal or immoral order it is my duty to disobey it
3982586 whether a country lives under freedom or tyranny or whatever else thats the collective responsibility of the people of that country
3982587 this is a very disappointing decision it puts canada more fully in complicity with an illegal and immoral war jeremy will probably end up back here at fort bragg thats usually what happens
3982588 i applied for conscientious objector status in the u s army because i realized that i cannot kill a fellow humna being but my application was denied i knew that in iraq i would be ordered to take part in combat operations or other actions that are against my principles
3982589 nga and i knew canada had welcomed many americans like us during the vietnam war and we knew canada had refused to join the invasion of iraq
3982590 sending jeremy and his family back to the u s where he would face harsh punishment would be cruel
3982591 it would fly in the face of the motion adopted by the house of commons on june 3 which called on the harper government to stop all deportation proceedings against these conscientious objectors
3982592 jeremy hinzman 29 had filed for a pre removal risk assessment and permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds with citizenship and immigration canada in january after several prior failed attempts to gain refugee status today he was told that both of those applications had been rejected and he must leave the country by sept 23
3982593 obviously were disappointed but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we end up
3982594 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed
3982595 robidoux said hinzman who lives in toronto with his wife and two children plans to take a close look at the decisions before deciding how to proceed
3982596 federal ndp citizenship and immigration critic olivia chow who put foward the june 3rd parliament motion called the decision to expell jeremy mean spirited she called on citizenship and immigration minister diane finley to hald the deporation of hinzman and other resisters immediately
3982597 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd please see the page for what you can do
3982598 these refugees have an uncertain status they are referred to as guests not refugees and year long residency permits are hard to obtain the vast majority were granted short stays in the country which since 2005 have become virtually impossible to renew without official paperwork the refugees are not allowed to work
3982599 are being sold for sex there is a large sex trade in young iraqi girls in the nighclubs of damascus fourteen and fifteen year olds literally girls not even women yet and even children are being sold
3982600 they have been great to me but i will no longer be involved with the pageant due to the fact that i really couldnt take it when i saw all those refugees in syria being mistreated seing these people suffer made me ashamed i dont deserve to live in a classy apartment while other women are selling themselves what kind of sick demented human being would want to have sex with a 10 year old
3982601 annual government budget in iraq exceeds 70 billion us dollars where is that money going power cuts are long people get electricity for only an hour or two a day water is cut off as well
3982602 u s lawmakers appropriated 8 5 billion to train and equip iraqs security forces in 2007 and 2008 of that sum roughly 457 million went to the iraqi air force
3982603 t he bad news is that 12 000 people represent a tiny fraction of the vast exodus of iraqis driven from their homes by the violence and ethnic cleansing unleashed by the 2003 u s invasion estimates of their number vary the widely used figure of 5 million is about one in five to get that into context relative to the size of the population it would equal the forced displacement of almost 60 million americans
3982604 at the end of july european countries decided to halt the processing of accepting new refugees and to postpone until september discussions about those who submitted their requests for refugee status the decision does not stem only from concern over the growth in the number of iraqis in europe and an increase in the muslim element on the continent but primarily against the backdrop of iraqi preime minister nuri request to stop absorbing refugees al maliki explained to european heads of state and interior ministers he met with that the situation in iraq has improved and iraq needs its refugees in order to rebuild the state

3982616 the government of india finds deeply objectionable the series of remarks by the official spokesman and leaders in pakistan on recent events in the indian state of jammu and kashmir
3982617 we are witnessing a recurrence of pakistani rhetoric and allegations that are factually wrong and that bear no relationship to reality
3982618 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mindset that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
3982619 it is not too late for pakistani leaders and spokesmen to desist from the course of action that they have recently embarked upon and we would urge them to do so forthwith
3982620 we are deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation in the indian occupied kashmir which is resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people and violation of their human rights

3982814 oltre al centro di consulenza noi ci occupiamo di un fondo prevenzione usura dal 98 gestiamo dei fondi del ministero delleconomia per garantire dei finanziamenti l dove vi sono i presupposti stabiliti dalla legge utili alla copertura dei debiti dei nuclei familiari che si sono rivolti a noi in poche parole interveniamo su quelle famiglie che hanno dei problemi di indebitamento e non sono pi in grado di gestire il loro bilancio familiare il fondo agevola laccesso al credito e va a rimodulare il debito complessivo di quella famiglia cercando di ridurlo con delle transazioni nei confronti dei creditori lobiettivo che questa famiglia abbia un unico finanziamento garantito con i soldi dello stato che vale per lappunto a chiudere tutti gli altri debiti lasciandone uno soltanto con una rata sostenibile
3982815 l dove possibile e chiaro che non possiamo aiutare tutti per cerchiamo di ripristinare le normali condizioni economiche di quella famiglia non un semplice intervento che mira ad una risoluzione del problema esclusivamente economico cerchiamo di formare queste persone ad un uso responsabile del denaro
3982816 le tipologie di sovraindebitati che noi riceviamo sono le pi disparate noi non interveniamo sul singolo ma sui nuclei familiari che presentano la domanda di aiuto al fondo se poi il nucleo familiare tante volte coincide con il singolo perch magari composto da una sola persona va bene ma generalmente lintervento viene fatto sul nucleo familiare su tutti
3982817 in maniera responsabile e irresponsabile anche negli altri paesi ci sono poi delle situazioni di responsabilit solo che l il mercato del credito esiste da tanti anni e le famiglie sono abituate allutilizzo di questo strumento che in s per s uno strumento positivo il credito al consumo non parliamo ora di mutuo ossia lacquisto a rate di beni o servizi una buona cosa perch d la possibilit quando viene utilizzato e offerto in una certa maniera di acquistare dei beni che altrimenti uno con un determinato reddito non si potrebbe permettere per esempio una famiglia monoreddito con il credito al consumo pu acquistare una lavatrice affrontando rate facilmente gestibili sempre che non si verifichino degli imprevisti menzionati in precedenza il problema quando si abusa del credito al consumo per comprare beni voluttuari in modo consequenziale prima il telefonino poi la vacanza poi ancora la tv satellitare si pensa di sostenere quelle spese ma rata dopo rata non si riesce pi a pagare le rate del finanziamento
3982818 generalmente queste cose capitano nei grossi centri di distribuzione anche se ho la possibilit di comprare tale articolo in contanti vengo attratto dallo sconto considerevole vincolato per dallacquisto a rate
3982819 i commercianti prendono subito i soldi lo stesso in quanto la finanziaria li rimborsa immediatamente e chiaro che quello un incentivo ad acquistare arate e ci non va bene io ho il diritto di acquistare a rate ma non posso essere obbligato ad acquistare a rate per avere lo sconto se mi dici acquista oggi e paghi fra sette mesi chi mi dice se fra sette mesi avr la disponibilit di pagare in contanti il tutto o avr la possibilit di accedere un finanziamento a rate del bene di cui sono entrato in possesso altra cosa che non va bene secondo noi il fatto di parlare tanto di difficolt di accesso al credito lei sapr che esistono delle societ di referenza creditizia le vecchie e cosiddette centrali di rischi in italia sono tre o quattro e gestiscono delle banche dati in collaborazione con le finanziarie e gli istituti di credito queste censiscono la vita economica relativa allutilizzo del credito di ogni soggetto che nel passato ha contratto dei debiti quindi sono in grado di stabilire chi un buono o un cattivo pagatore e difficile accedere al credito per alcune figure lavorative per esempio il lavoratore autonomo e i lavoratori atipici chi ha la busta paga invece generalmente accede a tutto soprattutto per quanto riguarda il credito al consumo
3982820 la cessione del quinto unaltra cosa nel senso che si arriva a quella fase quando non si ha pi accesso al credito normale con la busta paga uno pu procedere allacquisto solo di piccoli beni per esempio ho ricevuto qui famiglie in cui il capofamiglia possessore di una busta paga con contratto a tempo indeterminato aveva ben dodici posizioni debitorie questi era allarmato che nessuno gli desse pi credito sicuramente alla tredicesima richiesta di finanziamento qualcuno si sar svegliato rispondendogli io il credito non te lo concedo gli altri dodici glielhanno concesso per noi siamo certi che non bisognava arrivare a quel tipo di indebitamento per considerare quella persona super indebitata probabilmente gi il quinto il sesto il settimo ente finanziatore che gli ha concesso il credito doveva dire stop invece si continuato si presenta spesso qui anche chi ha il mutuo casa e poi otto carte revolving le cosiddette carte a ciclo rotativo che vanno tanto di moda adesso e che sono offerte sempre pi spesso dalle finanziarie per lacquisto dei beni prima per acquistare un televisore si accendeva un finanziamento e si pagava con i bollettini terminate le rate erano terminati anche i moduli di pagamento adesso invece nel momento in cui ti affidano la carta revolving loro hanno lintenzione di andare a fidelizzare il cliente con la carta revolving molto pi facile accedere ai finanziamenti e si risparmino i tempi per le istruttorie per alla fine del finanziamento il consumatore tende a conservare la carta tenere la carta significa essere incoraggiati indirettamente ad altri acquisti e predispone allindebitamento in pi alcuni utilizzano la revolving per pagare le rate di altri finanziamenti infatti questa carta ha un fido che va dai 1 500 fino ai 3 000 5 000 euro la rata quindi ogni mese va ad aumentare in funzione di quanto si sfrutta tale carta vista erroneamente come salvadanaio le persone devono sapere che quelle carte hanno degli interessi cos importanti che difficile uscirne la spirale del sovraindebitamento porta infatti ad utilizzarla per andare avanti ma si tratta di un circolo vizioso
3982821 tutti quanti dobbiamo responsabilizzarci a partire proprio dalle famiglie bisogna educare le famiglie ad un uso responsabile e corretto del denaro tra laltro noi facciamo delle campagne che partono dalle scuole per fare in modo che poi chi utilizzi un certo tipo di finanziamento conosca veramente cosa sia e a cosa potrebbe andare incontro sappia quali sono i pro e i contro di quel prodotto in modo tale che liberamente possa scegliere di utilizzarlo o meno per esempio che cosa una carta revolving chi utilizza questa carta deve sapere che cos non una normale carta di credito perch in un negozio si deve acquistare quel televisore per forza con la carta revolving si deve poter scegliere con serenit e cognizione fra le diverse modalit di acquisto
3982822 molto spesso il sovraindebitato si presenta qui per ottenere il denaro il prima possibile quindi viene qui per chiedere soldi perch si ritrova in unasituazione di indebitamento cos importante da essere schiacciato da un punto di vista materiale psicologico ed emotivo la situazione gli comporta problemi nei confronti dei creditori che continuano a chiamarlo attraverso societ di recupero crediti che non lo fanno pi vivere seguono ostacoli a livello relazionale nei confronti del proprio nucleo familiare molte volte lequilibrio affettivo del nucleo familiare tende ad esplodere come per esempio i rapporti fra moglie e marito di fatto il debitore chiede denaro e non ascolta se gli si segnala che ha fatto degli errori vuole solo pagare i creditori
3982823 il nostro compito non facile perch dobbiamo trovare dallaltra parte una persona che vuole uscire da tale situazione in modo costruttivo molte volte non dicono tutta la verit non semplice raccontare i tuoi affari soprattutto quando si entra nel personale il problema del sovraindebitamento pu arrivare a coinvolgere anche altre situazioni di malattia di cattivo rapporto con il partner che pu portare ad una spesa compulsiva e capitato anche di persone che avevano gravi problemi di dipendenza dal gioco per cui bisogna valutare caso per caso e ovvio che si cerca di mettere a proprio agio queste persone di creare un rapporto umano e poi l dove sia possibile si interviene sul problema economico molte volte riusciamo a risolverli altre volte non ci riusciamo perch di fatto la legge non perfetta stiamo promuovendo attualmente in discussione alla camera una proposta di legge sul sovraindebitamento che integri la legge 108 del 96 la legge sullusura che ormai ha superato i dieci anni con questa proposta di legge noi vogliamo aiutare quelli rimasti fuori dal fondo vi sono delle situazioni di indebitamento cos gravi che il fondo non pu aiutare per motivi di plafond perch lindebitamento che copriamo non supera i 26 000 euro purtroppo lindebitamento medio delle famiglie italiane cresciuto rispetto a 10 anni fa ci stiamo accorgendo che 26 000 non sono pi sufficienti per andare a risolvere il problema dei debiti di una famiglia
3982824 noi prima avevano delle convenzioni con alcuni istituti di credito e fino a 5 6 anni fa 15 000 euro spesso bastavano per risolvere i problemi di debito nel nucleo familiare da qualche anno ci siamo accorti che ormai 15 000 euro non bastano pi e cos abbiamo dovuto innalzare la somma a 26 000 euro adesso non bastano pi neanche questi 26 000 la maggior parte delle famiglie che vengono qui si presentano con 40 50 60mila euro di debiti e non parlo di mutuo guarda caso in questi ultimi sei anni entrato in vigore leuro scelta obbligata e positiva se non ci fosse stata la speculazione che in vigore anche adesso
3982825 nel nostro centro arrivano molte domande da nuclei familiari con 5 6 7 10 posizioni in essere come possibile che queste persone si siano trovate ad avere 10 posizioni in essere quando gi alla quarta e alla quinta era evidente che i richiedenti non erano in grado di pagare allora c un problema di accesso al credito per alcuni ed eccesso di credito per altri ci vuole un equilibrio
3982826 ci vuole equilibrio tutti quanti dobbiamo prendere coscienza di una situazione e dobbiamo muoverci in un certo modo
3982827 per quanto riguarda lindagine un po invasiva esiste una legge sulla privacy che ogni giorno secondo me viene calpestata lazione invasiva viene fatta un p da tutti tutti sanno che cosa facciamo per esempio quante volte si ricevono telefonate a casa chi commissiona le telefonate gi sa con chi parla per proporgli una precisa tipologia di prodotto la privacy ormai violata continuamente un fenomeno che riguarda tutti gli ambiti per quanto riguarda la cessione del quinto dello stipendio non un prodotto finanziario nato ieri ma esiste da anni e uno strumento anche utile in alcuni casi in particolare quando ci sono difficolt di accesso al credito infatti la cessione del quinto con la busta paga lunico modo di far fronte ai debiti gli inconvenienti risiedono nel fatto che costa molto ha tassi di interesse elevati ed anche molto onerosa leventuale estinzione anticipata il problema quando c un abuso della cessione del quinto si chiama cessione del quinto perch al massimo si pu chiedere la decurtazione di un quinto della busta paga al netto molte volte per qui ci troviamo molte persone con due tre cessioni sulla busta paga come possibile e possibile nel momento in cui io autorizzo la societ con la cessione del quinto a decurtami una quota della busta paga posso anche dare il placet nel farmi prelevare tutta la busta paga questo non possibile quando invece mi ritrovo qui delle persone che hanno oltre alla cessione del quinto due e tre pignoramenti la legge dovrebbe tutelare la persona in difficolt regolando i rapporti fra la persona in difficolt e i creditori la cessione del quinto dovrebbe andare a pagare progressivamente tutti i creditori che legittimamente vantano un credito ma uno per volta
3982828 un piano di rientro a vita questo molte volte non avviene e quindi noi ci ritroviamo qui delle persone che hanno delle buste paga martoriate da cessioni del quinto pignoramenti e questo non pu essere fatto per continua a capitare
3982829 e molto pi facile incontrarne a causa delle nuove norme delle centrali di referenza creditizia prima per essere iscritto in queste banche dati dovevi proprio essere uno che non paga ora basta non pagare con regolarit le rate del finanziamento ossia per esempio quando si pagano le rate sempre dopo la scadenza questo sufficiente per essere iscritto nelle centrali di referenza creditizia
3982830 la finanziaria dovrebbe differenziare fra chi paga in ritardo di quattro giorni per esempio ma paga sempre rispetto a chi di fatto sempre moroso questa scrematura non viene fatta poi c sempre la finanziaria che consulta le centrali di referenza creditizia e nonostante tutto continua a concedere il credito la societ di recupero crediti generalmente non fa capo al creditore di origine quando il creditore di origine la finanziaria la banca capisce che molto difficile recuperare quel credito e non ha un proprio ufficio legale delega una societ esterna si tratta di un mandato a termine e chiaro che queste societ avendo un mandato a termine molte volte attuano dei comportamenti che non sono cos leciti e quindi vanno oltre ecco per quale motivo molto spesso si arriva alle minacce pressioni mobbing psicologico
3982831 e vero loro chiaramente dicono di no ma il gioco delle parti
3982832 prima di tutto sono al momento in grado di poter sostenere il finanziamento e poi posso acquistare il debito in s per s non un problema perch se ho i redditi per pagare quel prestito io posso accendere quel prestito se ho tanto reddito da poter accedere a due o tre prestiti pagher quei due tre prestiti se io non ho il denaro necessario a pagare quelle rate non posso accendere quei finanziamenti molte volte si va ad accedere quei finanziamenti anche quando non c la possibilit di rimborsarli
3982833 unanalisi realistica del proprio bilancio familiare frutto di una verifica mensile dei redditi a disposizione
3982834 fanno sballare il bilancio sono proprio i cinque e i dieci euro che spendo qua e l che poi alla fine del mese soprattutto in una situazione di disequilibrio fra entrate e uscite mi fanno sballare tanti piccoli sforamenti comportano poi un problema pi grosso
3982835 s fare un bilancio preventivo poi chiaro che se uno non arriva non arriva meglio fare i conti che non farli se si fanno i conti si limitano i danni a patto che non ci siano imprevisti gravi per esempio perdita del lavoro una malattia ecc in condizioni normali circoscrivo i danni se invece non faccio questa cosa rischio di trovarmi in una situazione molto pi grave
3982836 ci stiamo avvicinando molto agli americani anche se gli statunitensi sanno gestire meglio la situazione conoscono meglio gli strumenti e i prodotti chevengono offerti loro
3982837 lavere si riferisce a cose e le cose sono fisse e descrivibili lessere si riferisce allesperienza lesperienza umana in via di principio indescrivibile la modalit dellessere ha come pre requisiti lindipendenza la libert e la presenza della ragione critica
3982838 consumare una forma dellavere forse quella di maggior momento per lodierna societ industriale opulenta il consumo ha caratteristiche ambivalenti placa lansia perch ci che uno ha non pu essergli ripreso ma impone anche che il consumatore consumi sempre di pi dal momento che il consumo precedente ben presto perde il proprio carattere gratificante i consumatori moderni possono etichettare se stessi con questa formula io sono ci che ho e ci che consumo
3982839 guardi che se paga per contanti non pu usufruire dello sconto del 20 dovr corrispondere il prezzo pieno se vuole approfittare dello sconto promozionale si deve accomodare al box appositamente allestito c l una finanziaria la findomestic che le far un finanziamento per credito al consumo poi fra sei mesi se vuole paga in contanti o comincia a pagare a rate

3982853 questo dato ci preoccupa dice il segretario confederale lamberto santini responsabile per le politiche di tutela dei consumatori della uil sia dal punto di vista della trasparenza dei prodotti finanziari proposti che troppo spesso non forniscono un quadro globale dei costi da sostenere al momento dellindebitamento polizze assicurative accessorie attualmente escluse nel conteggio del taeg modalit di ammortamento del debito ecc sia dal punto di vista del sovraindebitamento
3982854 attualmente i dati relativi allinsolvenza sono contenuti conclude lamberto santini ma c da considerare che nel corso dellanno sono stati concessi molti finanziamenti finalizzati al consolidamento di debiti pregressi oltre al continuo ricorso delle banche e delle finanziarie ad operazioni di cartolarizzazione dei crediti

3982889 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
3982890 there are many young strong single people in the athletes village and like everywhere some will fall in love or other things so we need to make condoms available

3982893 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3982894 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3982895 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3982896 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3982897 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3982898 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3982899 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3982900 allerdings haben wir die bedienung vereinfacht und sind damit auf diverse anregungen von ebay mitgliedern eingegangen
3982901 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

3982904 it is with deep regret that we inform our members of the sad news that keiran williams aka fibreoptic and registered on here as keiran2k8 has passed away aged 16 keiran joined skyuser on 11 10 06 and was a great help with helping us to populate our forums with useful posts rip keiran
3982905 update something not quite right is going on about this news
3982906 earlier on today we posted a news item on the basis that digital spy had allowed discussion on the subject it would now appear that this was a cruel hoax and we have absolutely no idea if the story was true or not we do have a screen shot of the text posted under the members username that had had the bad news posted about today however that doesnt mean that it is true or not or indeed if it is a hoax or not rather than keep everyone in the dark we have removed the original thread and made this thread to attempt to explain what has happened to the original thread one thing that has happened tonight a person using that members forum username and password has tonight logged onto skyuser with the ip resolving to pperso free fr

3982923 when i didnt serve out at 5 3 and i hit three double faults that kind of drove me crazy
3982924 but i regained my composure and once i broke him in the second set i knew i could win
3982925 i was cramping at 5 6 and the trainer told me he could not see me until the end of the set so i had to carry on
3982926 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3982927 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3982928 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3982929 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3982930 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3982931 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

3982934 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3982935 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3982936 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3982937 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3982938 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3982939 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3982940 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3982941 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3982942 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3982943 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3982944 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3982945 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3982946 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3982947 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3982948 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3982949 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3982950 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3982951 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
3982952 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3982953 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3982954 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3982955 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3982956 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

3982968 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3982969 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3982970 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3982971 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3982972 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3982973 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3982974 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3982975 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3982976 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3982977 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3982978 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3982979 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3982980 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3982981 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3982982 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3982983 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3982984 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3982985 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3982986 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3982987 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3982988 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3982989 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3982990 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3982991 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3982992 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3982993 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3982994 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3982995 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3982996 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3982997 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3982998 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

3983016 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3983017 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3983018 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3983019 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3983020 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3983021 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3983022 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3983023 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3983024 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3983025 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3983026 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3983027 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3983028 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3983029 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3983030 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3983031 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3983032 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3983033 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3983034 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3983035 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3983036 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3983037 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3983038 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3983039 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3983040 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

3983246 this is the time to support the athletes who are there
3983247 its sad when you see these third world countries at least winning a medal or two and a rich large country like canada has won squat
3983248 canadians are expecting medals we like to know were doing as well as countries like australia but i think we need to take a step back
3983249 for instance looking at whats going on in the pool sure we havent won a medal yet but there are a lot of our swimmers who have set canadian records who have had personal best performances and thats worth something and i think we should be proud of how our athletes are doing
3983250 if we dont start making these moves were going to start moving backward

3983259 that solar ray panel would be 6 000 square feet which represents 2 percent of wegmans roof its not a lot
3983260 i think we can do a lot more than that we all know that solar panels its not something that is a matter of if its going to be coming its a matter of when and i think when is now
3983261 solar panels are such a small part its a really green project
3983262 the chinese government is actively waging an olympics propaganda campaign to showcase tibet as legitimately theirs and tibetans as happy under chinese rule but the reality is much different

3983276 you have heard the statement by the u s president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
3983277 it means that georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense ministry in order to conduct humanitarian and other missions this is a very important statement for easing tension

3983298 lunatics difference from other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them so you have to use surgery
3983299 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
3983300 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3983301 i spoke today with rice and she told me there are reports of acts of looting in gori that illegal groups are looting the city and russian troops are doing nothing
3983302 if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way
3983303 weve been playing some good one day cricket we were number one in the world earlier this year and were a proud nation
3983304 for us to come over here and win a test series and a one day series in england would be a big achievement and were all really keen to do that
3983305 ive tried to keep myself fit during my time off and played a couple of games for durham and then after that club cricket but adapting to international cricket again is going to be my big challenge irrespective of the conditions
3983306 getting used to the intensity that international players play at again is going to be my biggest step
3983307 in christianity neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point
3983308 i am excited to assist this cause with creating custom lupus awareness jewelry and donating part of the proceeds to help support lupus research

3983310 i have another temptation should i or should i not
3983311 were contracted to do more albums than just the one with the same label
3983312 but i dont think the touring is part of that thats our deal i think major labels these days are not what they used to be we knew a couple of people at the label dew process which is run by powderfingers management and weve worked with them before and it just seemed right its better to work with a small band of people that have the same passion and ambition that we do it does feel like a new beginning
3983313 its a pretty bold statement but the new sound is really exciting and we just want to play the new stuff we feel like weve stepped into a new dimension of the band were all psyched and ready to go its time we got out there and did what we love doing
3983314 its about time theres a real rock n roll band again
3983315 the sound of the hold steady was certainly something that turned us on to john as well as every other album hes ever done because he somehow manages to make the band sound like the band thats something weve been striving to achieve in the past we had lots of people that we were considering but in hindsight im so so glad to have gone with john he was awesome to work with
3983316 the biggest thing for us was to away from normality we could submerge ourselves in the project and there was nothing there to take off the focus we were completely inside the project we didnt have to think of anything else
3983317 weve played the songs through in rehearsal and it doesnt really detract from the song
3983318 the song is still quite powerful i dont think well bother hiring any extra hands
3983319 well keep it real and people can hum the horn lines and piano parts in their heads but one day we might employ a string orchestra who knows
3983320 the whole direction of the album is i think different to what weve done in the past and thats something we all got excited about
3983321 and then those few songs that we added strings or piano to
3983322 were just ideas at the time but they were undeniable we had to try them it was a matter of trial and error to a degree
3983323 according to the investigation the van was at fault and violated traffic rules
3983324 i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can if i can do that ill be fine
3983325 i was so calm that i think i could have seen each face in this venue

3983345 to a greater or lesser extent there is nobody who doesnt have this kind of fault or indiscretion in their past i think the most important thing is how we use that past experience in how we live our lives from here on
3983346 if you really must check then it would absolutely be best to ask her directly asking her friends why its almost as though you dont trust her
3983347 but if you really do love your wife i think if you kept quiet about the fact you knew in spite of knowing that would make you a very manly splendid husband to her
3983348 is she not no different to an amateur with a great experience of men
3983349 if the children knew it would a great shock cant you please keep it to yourself for their sakes
3983350 if you cant forgive her at least leave her without telling her the reason why

3983370 i hope the government does not push through with their plan it might hamper the peace process
3983371 we should avoid creating obstacles and stumbling blocks to the peace process our aim is to offer a peaceful solution
3983372 i know this may sound crazy but here it goes
3983373 its a great opportunity to share a slice of life in small town america in the midst of an engaging democratic process
3983374 im sure well learn a lot in the process and so will arabs about us
3983375 the u s government does not like al jazeera because theres a sense they feed into anti u s sentiment
3983376 its mission is to represent the arab streets to the rest of the world and present the rest of the world to the arab streets
3983377 its a color piece to show arab viewers what americans are like
3983378 the idea is reach out to real world people and not just politicians and activists

3983385 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3983386 we are not looking to nor do we need to take control of any air or seaports to conduct this mission
3983387 the role of the u s military is strictly to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims of this conflict
3983388 the rhetoric used by russia and the u s has been scary
3983389 all cold war clich s have been dragged out and used again
3983390 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3983391 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3983392 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3983393 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3983394 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3983395 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
3983396 it makes me angry i really want people like that to be caught and brought to justice
3983397 this is the beginning of the next level of fraud thats being committed with point of sale devices
3983398 everytime we come up with a safeguard or stop for one element of crime it morphs into something else it finds another path

3983408 how you people ever got into ivy league schools i have no idea
3983409 hes learning his third offense in three years the biggest thing for him is reprogramming his mind
3983410 hes getting the opportunity because of injuries but i think hes going to make the most of it
3983411 i still want him to remain calm theres a sense he sometimes gets where hes almost hyperventilating he just needs to remain calm thats a skill

3983413 the second nugget in the book involves a supposed order from the white house to me at the cia to have my staff fabricate a letter connecting iraq with al qaida and the attacks of 9 11
3983414 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
3983415 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
3983416 people always ask well why couldnt you schedule a lesser team
3983417 well theres probably a pretty good chance that everybody is looking for that lesser team and that lesser team is probably seeing if they can put themselves in a favorable position i think you have to play the best to be the best but i have also said we dont want to play the best all in one year either
3983418 guaranteed games with non bcs schools are harder to find and the price goes up
3983419 non bcs teams shop for the highest payday in some way i am in that position now at northern illinois our goal was to max revenue and also maintain a scheduling balance
3983420 if you look at the scheduling down the road we try to build bye weeks not 12 straight weeks
3983421 we wanted to get home and home games with opponents and we tried to do that
3983422 i understand the competition you dont want what you would consider a murderers row in scheduling and this year is harsh theres no two ways about it theres no soft pedal
3983423 i think whenever you have a top caliber bcs program competition is a great thing not only for the student athletes and the program but for the fans as well needless to say the response has been very good
3983424 have a good bcs school in there a low tier bcs school and a non bcs school
3983425 young people get excited when you talk about you are going to play ohio state you are going to play notre dame the guys like that kind of challenge i think our quarterback jake locker would like that kind of challenge
3983426 we could play fcs teams but its just the tradition but theres nothing wrong with that
3983427 but at some point traditions also broken sometimes too i have always said you want to play a difficult schedule that helps you but you need balance thats all
3983428 carl peterson did a study for the kansas city chiefs
3983429 hes one of the most experienced presidents general managers in the national football league
3983430 hes been there since 1989 and hes done studies as to holdouts not only in kansas city but all through the league he says theres a much higher correlation or a chance of getting injured after holding out regardless of position
3983431 hes only 25 he could run for 2000 yards its a steal it would be over valuing those scrubs taking them here
3983432 i think we have a couple there that even though theyre young are going to come up and complement quarterback jake locker very well
3983433 we all know what he can do and were anxious for him to get back
3983434 i think chris polk is doing some very good things
3983435 its still a thing were trying to figure out how to utilize him best but hes definitely done some things well there
3983436 im kind of not really focused on it im just trying to get in there and learn and then make an impact
3983437 thats one of the main points weve got to do right now so thats what im focusing on real hard im doing good on that
3983438 its got to be because thats what everyones teaching to come in and rip that ball out
3983439 especially for the four coming out of high school its something new to them

3983443 the coaches teach these children the fundamentals of the game and great sportsmanship
3983444 elida has a team that they will be registering in the junior league
3983445 this program is a great feeder program for the junior high and eventually the high school football teams
3983446 at this point theres nothing standing in our way of continuing to do what we said were going to do
3983447 all those things result in lots of other mechanical parts and bits and pieces that have nothing to do with electrical energy
3983448 such that the vehicle is not just a battery on wheels
3983449 the program has all of those same things built in were just doing them faster because we have to
3983450 its an entirely different technology its an entirely different powertrain layout its a huge step forward
3983451 this and the other vehicles that are coming out in plug in form are in a lot of ways prototype vehicles being put on the market to test
3983452 doing so would require the commission to resolve highly technical environmental debates that are beyond its expertise

3983455 wal mart believes that a well designed cap and trade system will foster competition innovation and business to business and business to consumer transactions
3983456 as long as businesses are at least doing something to conserve they do not need to be penalized
3983457 they keep pressuring me because i know people from both sides
3983458 we start walking and talking and i dont go back to class
3983459 they want to remain friends with these kids theyve grown up with since elementary
3983460 the teachers are saying you get out of my class right now and go to the office but these kids never make it to the office the hallways are just filled with them
3983461 no one ever goes out to check they talk about no child left behind theres like 200 kids at that school being left behind
3983462 obviously in the city of seattle gangs are growing again i see that happening my feeling about kids in school is that if they are bonded to the school if they feel like this is their place that kind of stuff diminishes so thats where part of my focus is going to be
3983463 we dont have people to do that outreach to go looking for them
3983464 were just not funded for it its the responsibility of the assistant principals and counselors
3983465 kids can be gathering in churches and stuff like that but until you start dealing with whats going on in schools i dont care how many anti violent programs theyre having
3983466 theres not really that many out there to tell you the truth
3983467 this is something were acutely aware of making sure that our kids dont slip through the cracks both the victims and perpetrators of violence
3983468 when we roll out our budget in september this is going to be a priority one of our main focuses for the next year
3983469 the gang problems flare up money comes pouring in they go away the money dries up
3983470 this problem is never going to go away until there is something sustainable for working with youth in prevention and intervention
3983471 we had hundreds of young men 16 to 20 years old who were not in school and none of the agencies could get paid for working with them anymore because it was not wasl based
3983472 as a result no ones working with that population and you have this fermenting population full of rage
3983473 but they have to be negotiated with to ignore them and say we dont deal with you because youre a beast is ridiculous i mean we deal with the president of pakistan
3983474 working directly with families works thats what we learned more than anything in the early years a lot of those old school programs we need to bring back
3983475 the presence of a youth gang problem must be recognized before anything meaningful can be done to address it
3983476 you do not have to be drawn in to the violence
3983477 we need to know what kids they have labeled in which gangs so we can go up to these parents and say are you aware of this

3983490 the white population is older and very much centred around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
3983491 the future of america is epitomised by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
3983492 its hard to find us thats one of our biggest challenges
3983493 it was time for me to move on to make a fresh start
3983494 we drove in and saw the art galleries the cafes the hippies the drumming circle on friday night i didnt see any victorias secret or mcdonalds it was a nice homey feeling everyone seemed to be grooving
3983495 people are still taking their trips theyre just staying closer to home
3983496 whats helping us is our location to so many areas
3983497 if someone is in the new york metro area they may not drive to the outer banks or as far as virginia but they can still come and experience pennsylvania
3983498 we started limiting driving when gas hit three bucks at 3 80 it got even worse
3983499 roads and bridges will suffer as a result of less fuel being sold
3983500 people are doing a lot better job of planning than they used to
3983501 they are being selective about where they are driving and how far they are driving people are sort of in limbo waiting to see when this is going to level out
3983502 you wont see the same change in quarter four of this year where well see some of the cheapest gas prices this year
3983503 were becoming desensitized to high gas prices we resume our old habits when gas prices start going down
3983504 this is a shift of monumental proportions that we have never seen before
3983505 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3983506 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
3983507 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbours that what it thinks about u s policy

3983510 will cross the ministry in everything as in duty bound
3983511 so long as we do not have political stability we cant tackle both these issues properly political stability can be achieved through an approach of reconciliation as opposed to an approach of confrontation
3983512 i request all elements that they should adopt an approach of reconciliation so that there is political stability and we can confront problems like the worsening economy extremism and terrorism on a strong footing this is the need of the hour we must sink our differences and adopt the slogan of pakistan first and move forward
3983513 there is no doubt that every pakistani is with his kashmiri brothers and sisters at this juncture i have no doubt that kashmir is the heartbeat of every pakistani and i have no doubt that kashmir runs in the blood of pakistan
3983514 enemies and some elements both external and internal want to destabilise and weaken us
3983515 i believe there could be some conspiracy external or internal against our state institutions we have to stand up as a nation and prove as in 1947 that pakistan will remain united we must show this to the world
3983516 if both are there the nation gets stronger our military army navy and air force is intact and will always defend the country the people and military are one if the army has the back up of the people the oneness of the nation will be at the forefront
3983517 we can confront these menaces when the people are with the military
3983518 hitting at pakistans foundations and spoiling the image of islam
3983519 pakistans enemies have always thought that it will not remain united but the people have proved our enemies wrong pakistan has prospered and progressed

3983522 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
3983523 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
3983524 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
3983525 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
3983526 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
3983527 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
3983528 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
3983529 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
3983530 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
3983531 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
3983532 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
3983533 nick why on earth would you need that much horsepower rendering video some super awesome scientific application
3983534 in spite of the challenges faced by our economy our earnings continued their sustained upward trajectory clearly underscoring the success of the strategy that we have put in place
3983535 with the expected global slowdown we project that bpo office demand will continue to increase if not accelerate

3983537 geen dozen met gratis spullen dit keer voor een item zul je moeten zweten
3983538 its nice that weve played some of the nec teams over the years theres some comfort there
3983539 we know the quality of the programs from top to bottom in the nec is outstanding were excited to be part of a conference that continues to grow and get better each year
3983540 joining is a major plus and a major challenge for duquesne
3983541 its nice to have two quality guys who can go
3983542 i think weve got some players who know what it takes to win football games
3983543 dave has been a starter for almost 3 1 2 years and i cant remember him ever making a bad snap
3983544 hes a great worker who comes from a great family he was raised the right way hes been a tremendous asset to our football team
3983545 im very honored to be recognized at the national level
3983546 im just thankful to be recognized with so many other great players all around the country from schools like mount union wesley and brockport state
3983547 i was very impressed with the football program and the coaching staff
3983548 it was an opportunity to play for a great division iii program the academics are challenging so that was a plus it was an opportunity i couldnt pass up
3983549 he works his tail off he loves w amp j football and is very passionate about his work ethic hes the leader of our offensive line were only going as far as he takes us and im pretty confident hell take us pretty far
3983550 it was a real heartbreaker especially since it was in overtime we just have to put that out of our mind and move forward
3983551 every week will be a challenge but we hope to meet those challenges with the nucleus we have coming back theres no reason why we shouldnt do what we did last year and maybe more
3983552 i guess im an offensive defenseman but i can play defense at the same time
3983553 i like to make sure my own end is taken care of first before worrying about anything else
3983554 were looking for him to be a good solid two way defenseman
3983555 hes a guy who goes back and makes a good first pass and can contribute some offense
3983556 we like the fact he led the league in scoring among defensemen were hoping to get more offense out of our defense and josh is a big part of that
3983557 it helped a lot that im a local guy who grew up about 45 minutes away from rmu i played junior hockey 10 hours away from home so i was looking to go to a school closer to home it was the right fit academically as well thats why i chose robert morris
3983558 you could see he wanted to be successful he had it in his plans a lot of kids want to be good hockey players but a lot of them dont want to follow through and do the extra work you need to do to be a division i player you could see right away that he had that work ethic
3983559 it helps out having some local guys kids with whom weve grown up playing hockey
3983560 the younger guys they see all the guys from pittsburgh playing locally at a high level
3983561 i think once you get one kid it kind of creates a pipeline
3983562 having a very good local player helps in getting other very good local players
3983563 i still dont think playing is out of my system but i think the window for me is pretty much shut
3983564 a lot of guys chase that dream but i dont think i can continue chasing i think its time to get started on my next life
3983565 kids here knew me so i got their attention very quickly when i was in charlotte kids knew nothing about me but they gave me the same response when i was trying to teach them that gave me the sign that this was the right direction to move
3983566 when i talked to rod about the position and about what our mission statement is here at saint vincent he seemed like a great fit we offered and im glad he took it
3983567 he obviously has some name recognition in the western pennsylvania area
3983568 some guys take other routes but this is the way im going
3983569 i was on the team two summers ago so i knew we would have a really good team
3983570 and i always knew we could do some special things
3983571 ive been doing this for awhile so im very familiar with playing competitive baseball with travel teams
3983572 what you base your team off of is pitching and how deep you have pitching and also on offensive power
3983573 everybody will make errors because everybody is human what picks you up is your power and your pitching i knew from the get go that this was going to be one of the best teams weve had because of how much we had of each
3983574 there are some great baseball players here im not going to say just good theyre great
3983575 is everybody going to get drafted no but are there players who are going to have a very successful college careers most definitely
3983576 i thought that it would definitely help me with the competition id be facing
3983577 i shows me what i need to do to play at that level and im glad i did it
3983578 we had some of our best practices as an 0 8 and 0 9 team
3983579 i think the biggest challenge was keeping the players morale to the point that they didnt want to give up on us the way we were practicing when we were 0 8 showed me they were buying into what we were trying to do
3983580 i just want to have an overall improvement i want to be more competitive and i want to be in position to win games
3983581 we have to be able to stop the run thats been the main emphasis were going to put on our team in preseason camp
3983582 we recruited 71 players and we were a team that lost 10 games and wasnt competitive
3983583 i think that says that a great number of players are buying into the fact that this can work and shows that we can continue rebuilding
3983584 were going to be a better football team how many victories that will translate to i cant say but well be way more competitive thats for sure
3983585 i really didnt enjoy real estate all that much and i realized swimming and coaching was where i wanted to be
3983586 i have been doing some coaching this summer with the peters township aqua club and i thought i would give coaching a shot
3983587 i didnt want to do high school coaching when you get to college it seems the athletes are more committed to the sport in high school a lot of swimmers are there because their parents make them go i thought i would enjoy college coaching more because of the commitment of the athletes
3983588 by the time the u s nationals rolled around in march this year i was kind of burned out on swimming
3983589 i wanted to get into something else but now after watching the trials and olympics on television i think i might want to do it again
3983590 its kind of up in the air as to whether she would continue to swim competitively but im thinking about it after seeing it on tv i got kind of mad at myself that i didnt try
3983591 olympic team member dara torres is 41 and shes still great theres no reason i couldnt do it
3983592 i went to a swimming camp at kenyon college as a coach in june and i made a lot of contacts there
3983593 there were a whole lot of great coaches there and i really learned a lot
3983594 but i kind of knew dickinsons coach his team has competed against my dads for a long time and i know they have a great program
3983595 they have a solid program and i think i can help
3983596 for one thing because im so young i can relate to what the swimmers are going through with trying to juggle swimming and schoolwork and all that goes with it
3983597 i know i will have to earn the dickinson swimmers respect they might respect me for what i have done but i still will have to earn their respect as a coach
3983598 im looking forward to it i think its a great opportunity to get started in my career
3983599 i was on the team two summers ago so i knew we would have a really good team and i always knew we could do some special things
3983600 ive been doing this for awhile so im very familiar with playing competitive baseball with travel teams
3983601 what you base your team on is pitching and how deep you have pitching and also on offensive power
3983602 everybody will make errors because everybody is human what picks you up is your power and your pitching i knew from the get go that this was going to be one of the best teams weve had because of how much we had of each
3983603 a lot of the bigger colleges are represented here plus a lot of the better smaller schools
3983604 also this gives guys a chance to stay home with their families work and also play a high caliber of baseball the objective is to give them work so that when they go back to school theyre better players
3983605 there are some great baseball players here im not going to say just good theyre great
3983606 is everybody going to get drafted no but are there players who are going to have a very successful college careers most definitely
3983607 ive known five pilots that have encountered it over the years
3983608 they have had at least 50 malfunctions seven of them were a total loss very serious
3983609 it just so happens it wasnt at the right time
3983610 blanking of electronic displays can pose a significant safety risk
3983611 crews attempts to troubleshoot may lead to more serious problems or even loss of aircraft control
3983612 they are now just now starting to train pilots of how to handle this
3983613 you have a system thats supposed to strengthen airport security but you dont use the results of the tests to do exactly what youre doing the tests for
3983614 certainly we have used what weve learned over the years to improve security
3983615 the agency is not fully using the results of these tests
3983616 the first laptop case company to have fulfilled the design and testing requirements to be travel sentry approved
3983617 solo has been working to create checkpoint friendly cases for a number of reasons to speed up airport security clearance make traveling more convenient and also to radically reduce the risk of lost or damaged laptops the tsa reports that more than 25 of travelers are now traveling with notebooks and studies show many laptops are damaged or lost due to chaotic removal of items at security checkpoints our consumers are road warriors we are excited to offer additional innovative consumer focused solutions that aid in the protection of laptops and makes traveling faster and more convenient
3983618 fujitsu siemens computers on wednesday announced the release of the worlds first monitors to draw absolutely no power when in standby mode or what the company calls eco mode the two scenicview eco range monitors the 20 inch p20w 5 eco and 22 inch p22w 5 eco feature a power supply that automatically switches off when in the power saving mode the company claims the technology allows the monitors to draw zero watts during the state in comparison to between one and six watt draws from competitors
3983619 hey can i get three of these picks up glossy yet cheap photos and can you make one out to david and one to josh for my uncle and brother
3983620 ive got my own website my people would be pissed
3983621 he injured his elbow its a dislocation hell be alright but its just an ugly thing
3983622 this is not protest against land transfer in fact this is anger against india
3983623 i see this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through a bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
3983624 such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
3983625 disciplinary action to the maximum degree permitted by indian law should be taken as soon as possible against those found to be involved
3983626 i think its a step forward that we were able to reach an agreement on fully investigating the issue again
3983627 if the agreement is not acted upon then everything will break down if that happens we will also take necessary measures
3983628 i would like for them to be cautious and make sure they wont fall into north koreas trap
3983629 but we have reason to be encouraged and hopeful that the pace of the past will be reversed and we will see substantially more peacekeepers here in darfur
3983630 sometimes things have to get bad to get better maybe we have seen the worst in darfur and well begin to see the best out of the mission
3983631 im tense about it because ill be lying awake worrying about it all night
3983632 tree pollen is not a threat to people the environment or water supplies the resulting yellow mess is often misinterpreted as a chemical spill or industrial pollution but in fact the pollen is a good protein for organisms
3983633 although these pollutants are harmless greater wellington is happy to receive all reports of suspected pollution just in case
3983634 wed rather be notified of any suspected pollution than see it ignored as it could be something more serious
3983635 the survey was a critical component in our consultation with the public on the future of the ngauranga to airport corridor it helped provide us with a representative opinion across the board on the proposed projects
3983636 im excited something that last year i wouldnt have ever thought id be at the olympics
3983637 you cant control what place you come in i was a little disappointed in seventh but its seventh in the world so
3983638 just knowing that the outcome would be in gods hands and that i didnt have to worry about it
3983639 i wanted to set myself up for a fast swim and i knew thatd have to be in the first 100 unfortunately i just didnt have as much as i wanted coming back in the last 100 but it was a solid race im really happy with it
3983640 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3983641 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3983642 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3983643 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3983644 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3983645 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3983646 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3983647 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3983648 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3983649 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3983650 im excited something that last year i wouldnt have ever thought id be at the olympics
3983651 you cant control what place you come in i was a little disappointed in seventh but its seventh in the world so

3983654 i still find myself going to the studio after practice
3983655 once that studio door closes its like freedom again i can lock myself in my own world
3983656 it just put me in my own zone i could put it on paper and release my stress
3983657 there are probably a couple words i dont want to hear
3983658 its a struggle to continue to play hard every day its a struggle to get up every morning and stay focused and do what youre supposed to do its a struggle back home with my people friends family
3983659 just because im out of it doesnt mean im out of it
3983660 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
3983661 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
3983662 jack reads to her an hour a day as part of his home schooling
3983663 the world is whizzing around her and shes cool as a cucumber saying jack just started can i call you back
3983664 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3983665 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
3983666 and i think ridge is a great example of that
3983667 far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues
3983668 we are stunned and shaken by todays shooting at the arkansas democratic party where our good friend and fellow democrat bill gwatney was critically wounded
3983669 bill is not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante our thoughts and prayers are with bill and his family today and we wish him a quick recovery
3983670 this senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us

3983677 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3983678 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3983679 we are proceeding and the president mugabe is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3983680 morgan tsvangirai is the main opposition leader and any agreement that doesnt include his party will not work for the country it actually just complicates issues
3983681 yes we remain committed to dialogue but we want a fair power sharing arrangement
3983682 we will now have to go back to the people and explain our position they can go ahead and form their government we made our position clear that this issue is now in the hands of the facilitator
3983683 estamos unidos con las diferentes corrientes pol ticas y religiosas lo que propicia una buena gobernabilidad entre sus gobernados

3983689 the army is my army i think the army is not involved in politics
3983690 i assure you that general kayani is highly professional and he is pro democracy
3983691 the tidal wave is sweeping the country even his own former allies are now voting against him
3983692 we really worked and we were well prepared but unfortunately we made two mistakes and you cannot win gold with two mistakes
3983693 we never launched coverage in those countries because we simply werent satisfied with the map data we had available
3983694 were constantly searching for the best map data we can find and sometimes will delay launching coverage in a country if we think we can get more comprehensive data
3983695 about 10 000 bills are introduced over a two year session of congress
3983696 the challenge is equivalent to trying to capture a sharp unsmeared picture of a roadside billboard about a mile away with a 2 000mm telephoto lens held out the window of a car moving at 50mph
3983697 this man hes been talking absolutely rubbish he makes up stories
3983698 im not only going after him for the three articles im also going after the commentaries that have defamed me i will go after each one of the commentators
3983699 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles
3983700 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3983701 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3983702 there is no way in good conscience that we could proceed with a joint naval exercise given the state of this crisis
3983703 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3983704 thats whats at stake when russia engages in behaviour that looks like its from another time
3983705 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3983706 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3983707 i think its difficult for him to fix it because of the judgments hes made in the past and his lack of experience
3983708 if we are dissatisfied with obama as a potential president hillary cannot be expected to change our minds
3983709 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante
3983710 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3983711 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
3983712 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

3983721 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3983722 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3983727 t he american armed and trained georgian army swarmed into south ossetia last thursday killing an estimated 2 000 civilians sending 40 000 south ossetians fleeing over the russian border and destroying much of the capital tskhinvali
3983728 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
3983729 the war games included a us navy supercarrier battle group an us navy expeditionary carrier battle group a royal navy carrier battle group a french nuclear hunter killer submarine plus a large number of us navy cruisers destroyers and frigates playing the
3983730 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
3983731 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
3983732 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
3983733 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
3983734 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
3983735 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
3983736 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
3983737 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
3983738 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

3983745 im going to visit a friend and i dont expect much comment about the united states going to visit a friend
3983746 the georgians figured it was better to ask forgiveness later but not ask for permission first
3983747 needs to be a part of resolving the problem and solving the problems and not contributing to it
3983748 we are also very grateful for your support for our peace plan for the conflicts and for your unwavering support for georgias territorial integrity
3983749 we told them they had to keep their unilateral cease fire

3983758 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
3983759 white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush tahir jalil habbush the director of the mukhabarat to saddam hussein backdated to july 1 2001
3983760 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
3983761 i understand that there are some people who wish to bury any new facts concerning the subject of wmd in iraq they are ready to liquidate any person or group who ventures into this subject
3983762 are not ready to give interviews because that endangers their life it would endanger your life as well i am serious in my warning
3983763 nobody can guarantee your life nor the fate of the material you will be collecting in baghdad
3983764 i request that you adjourn your scheduled trip to baghdad
3983765 if you decide to continue with your intention then i am very sorry to tell you that taking the overall environment in my country i am not able to support your mission the main reason would be to preserve my life during or after it is concluded
3983766 i had made several important contacts in regards to your trip
3983767 as you know the situation inside iraq is very dangerous and confused and many people were hesitant to meet with you
3983768 they were afraid of what the americans might do if it was found out that they had met with you
3983769 they just disappeared into the shadows they are still very much a presence in baghdad and iraq
3983770 mr ritters life is at risk if he comes here as well as the life of any iraqi he meets with
3983771 if he does his life is at risk your life is at risk and everyone associated with his visits life will be at risk
3983772 i guess its just because you are who you are
3983773 george bush is in trouble our people did not find any wmd in iraq can you help us
3983774 can we prepare something for that we could bring in some nuclear material from the former soviet union and pretend they are iraqi

3983781 la construction de colonies isra liennes est un probl me
3983782 not invented here what vermont can learn from northern europe
3983783 the revolution may not be televised but it will be up loaded
3983784 this study should be enlightening and practice changing for doctors and patients alike
3983785 its a tricky business and it requires a lot of close followup
3983786 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight
3983787 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3983788 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3983789 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3983790 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
3983791 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
3983792 it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
3983793 ive made 30k a month ive made 50k per month
3983794 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
3983795 i think there are too many negatives and the negatives are too large for a gasoline price decline to change the story significantly
3983796 acquiring mo strengthens our nucleus of players for both the short and long term he is entering his prime nba years and will be part of the foundation of our future success
3983797 his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us
3983798 all these guys are very excited they respect mo as a player and theyre looking forward to playing with him
3983799 i think this is a move to be able to get a talented young 25 year old point guard that can be part of the future
3983800 i think there was so much pressure on lebron to create so much of the offense in cleveland
3983801 i think somebody like mo is going to really make the game easier for lebron and create opportunities for other people
3983802 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back
3983803 we understand that its a unique opportunity here specifically but weve got to do the best thing for our basketball team and we feel like the best thing for our basketball team is to add some toughness and some intangibles defensively for us at that position
3983804 his most productive days in the nba were just a few short years ago when he had rashard lewis on the other wing
3983805 here you say you have richard jefferson on another wing youre putting luke ridnour in the best possible position to be successful again as he has been in the past
3983806 our challenge from day one has been to shape our roster in a way that our fans will see a team that is competitive that plays hard every night and has a chance to win
3983807 we feel this trade continues to move us toward that goal for this season and beyond
3983808 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3983809 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3983810 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3983811 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3983812 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3983813 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offense and has apologized
3983814 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
3983815 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3983816 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3983817 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3983818 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3983819 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3983820 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
3983821 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else

3983825 teachers dont have to have all of the answers but they should know such things exist
3983826 dogma shuts down discussion and there is no more opportunity for dialogue
3983827 the report we received from the public will still need to be processed beforehand
3983828 we will take action once a thorough investigation is completed

3983832 saipans population is mostly that of filipinos every disaster affects filipinos and we need your help in preparing for disasters me and my team now want to get everyone involved not only government agencies
3983833 we want to encourage you to understand the importance of being prepared if a disaster happens here we may not be able to get help for at least three days so we want everyone to take action emergency preparedness is for everyone who lives and works on this island not only for us citizens
3983834 i am withdrawing my signature and will only affix my signature when i see that the slippery winding road is already paved safely
3983835 but because of the expressed desire of malaca ang and its supporters in the house of representatives the previous negative reception to the idea of charter change has been resurrected
3983836 it is therefore not surprising that senators who had affixed their signatures to the resolution no 10 of senator pimentel may be withdrawing
3983837 in sum the armm elections were generally conducted with less violence the new system were certainly a welcome improvement over the manual system on previous elections
3983838 i was going to improve my time a bit more but i guess to win this race is more important than setting a good time i thought i could set 2 06 but i guess i was being greedy
3983839 winning the 100 was a big factor for today i felt different after that
3983840 im a bit disappointed that i didnt get the world record but obviously delighted to win
3983841 for the last 50 meters i was slower than i thought but all in all i had a good race
3983842 i gave everything i had but when someone posts a world record like that i think this is my last olympics
3983843 sponsor is permitted to call even if entrants number is on the do not call registry for purpose of prize notification
3983844 do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind that by testing you may discern what is the will of god what is good and acceptable and perfect
3983845 this book of the law shall not depart from your mouth but you shall meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it for then you will make your way prosperous and then you will have good success have i not commanded you be strong and courageous do not be frightened and do not be dismayed for the lord your god is with you wherever you go
3983846 then one night my husband came home and told me
3983847 oggi ho solo cercato di mettere a fuoco le ultime gare che mancano alla conclusione
3983848 children of this age are basically curious and thats why cyber safety is failing
3983849 we talk about educating children about the internet but i think the department needs to educate their teachers on cyber safety and whats appropriate for a teacher to share online
3983850 if adults or siblings are giving our children access to facebook then it is a concern more widely
3983851 the school has taken appropriate action to ensure its teachers exercise discretion when posting material on sites such as facebook
3983852 con el mismo discurso del mes de enero de 2008
3983853 los temas que est n en discusi n son dos primero los recursos del idh que desde nuestro criterio han sido arrebatados en exceso para la renta dignidad y segundo el tema de las autonom as que debe pasar por una reforma constitucional
3983854 ya no hablan de un pacto fiscal y la nueva constituci n sino de la devoluci n del idh y una reforma constitucional que inviabiliza la aplicaci n de las propias autonom as es por eso que veo una posici n contradictoria esperamos que hasta ma ana jueves cambien de opini n

3983872 tinitimbang ko yung balance doon i must really strike a balance between being a christian kasi ako talaga mahina ang loob ko pagdating sa karamdaman ng tao consistent naman ako dyan pag may sakit na hanggat maari gusto naman natin gumaling kung malakas na i am balancing between being a christian and being a crusader against graft i just dont have the heart to worsen someones health
3983873 binabantayan natin ito kasi ayaw nating palusutin dahil kitang kita na nga natin yung agenda ng malaca ang dito na isa lang ang pakay nila para sa pagbabago ng saligang batas eh kung hindi man lumawig yung termino eh maiba yung balangkas ng gobyerno at siyay makapanungkulan pang muli were keeping an eye on charter change we will not allow it to get past us

3983904 transferring sultan kohails case to an adult court is very troubling given the possibility of him receiving the death penalty
3983905 we are working very hard with our lawyer but i dont know what will happen
3983906 usually after a sentence is done its done period but the implication in sultans case is that there is some pressure applied and it seems to come from the murdered mans family
3983907 this is what they are aiming for otherwise why change things
3983908 how is this going to apply to my life 10 years from now
3983909 for a just man falleth seven times and riseth up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief
3983910 for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence towards god and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight
3983911 whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it
3983912 master elijah i have heard about all these miracles and these feats of power that you have performed in your ministry ive heard about all the acts of power that god does for you as you travel through the land and i would like to travel with you because i would like to see the power of god i would like to see these miracles and these wonders
3983913 son im sorry but i cannot take you with me the ways of a prophet are hard and the ways of his god are difficult to understand
3983914 master elijah i beg of you let me go with you i want to see the power of god i want to be an eyewitness to the demonstration of the spirit of god i want to see these miracles
3983915 im sorry but i cannot take you with me the ways of a prophet are hard and the ways of his god are difficult to understand
3983916 i cannot take you with me the ways of a prophet are hard and the ways of his god are difficult to understand
3983917 alright i will take you with me but there is a condition on the day that you question anything that you see that is the day i will send you home that is the day you have to leave me the first day you question anything you see or hear in my ministry that is the day you must leave me and return home
3983918 i am elijah the tishbite my servant and i have need of lodging and victuals for we are hungry and we are tired
3983919 so you are elijah weve heard about you and we dont believe it we dont believe in you we dont believe in your miracles and we dont believe in your god we are busy and have no time for you now get lost
3983920 i am elijah the tishbite my servant and i have need of lodging and food
3983921 master elijah we dont have much but what we have is yours come into our home
3983922 master elijah master elijah i know that this is the day that you will send me home but i cannot understand i dont understand why at the edge of the city when those men wickedly entreated us why did you snap your mantle and your god miraculously finish that aqueduct and water began to flow into the city why
3983923 son the ways of a prophet are hard and the ways of his god are difficult to understand son what you do not know is that those men at the edge of the city were digging very near to the largest vein of gold in the entire country if they had been permitted to continue to dig they would have struck it they would have become the wealthiest city in the entire country but because they wickedly entreated the man of god and because they mocked his god god performed a miracle which looked like a blessing but in disguise it was a curse because he kept them from ever striking that vein of gold that city and its inhabitants because they wickedly entreated the man of god and mocked his god will forever live in want and in poverty
3983924 alright elijah alright master i can understand that but why at the hut where that little widow gave us all she had why after she took us in why did you snap your mantle and your god killed her cow her sustenance and her livelihood
3983925 son the ways of a prophet are hard and the ways of his god are difficult to understand son what you dont understand is that while you slept through the night the death angel came to take the life of the son i wrestled all night long with the angel until the breaking of the day while you slept i could not persuade the angel not to take the life of the son through the cracking of the dawn i was able to persuade the angel of death to exchange the life of the cow for the life of the son
3983926 god does not get involved in the affairs of man unless one invites him in

3983950 requires the alp to perform a double somersault with a pike and a few twists thrown in
3983951 there was a rush earlier this week to suggest this was a wake up call for alan carpenter nonsense on two fronts
3983952 firstly northern territory electorates are absurdly small outside the outrageous peppermint grove council none of them would be as populous as the average perth metropolitan council ward
3983953 far from calling the election too early some might have thought his robust report to the wa alp state conference a few weeks ago would have made a fine campaign launch
3983954 he knows too that wa is not a natural labor state
3983955 sociologically the blue collar component of the wa electorate is half that of sydney melbourne and adelaide and 50 per cent less than brisbane
3983956 likewise missing is a large non english speaking background electorate so richly supportive of labor in the east
3983957 to win any time in wa requires the alp to perform a double somersault with a pike and a few twists thrown in
3983958 hitherto that diving performance has had its degree of difficulty augmented by the most outrageously rorted electoral boundaries outside zimbabwe
3983959 to the eternal shame of the liberals that position still obtains in the legislative council
3983960 that standing insult to the average perth voter ought to incline them to punish the liberals until it is reversed

3984027 when youre at the olympics youre competing on the worlds largest stage

3984029 basketball is a big part of my life and i love teaching the sport and bringing a team together
3984030 i enjoy giving young women some of the same opportunities and experiences that i had in basketball
3984031 this is a quiet place where i can do my exercises and not bother anybody and nobody bothers me

3984033 when most people think about yo yos they think of an old duncan yo yo they had once

3984048 ill be real anxious to hear her giving her analysis
3984049 the experience and the friendships that i made thats what i miss
3984050 if anything not making this team and having to report it has made me hungrier and more focused to be playing

3984055 the times are all so much faster now and the rules have changed we didnt have the butterfly in the olympics then either
3984056 we went swimming every day thats when i got the bug
3984057 once we started going especially when we made the big team we were there every day at 7 a m before school and at 4 p m after school
3984058 that was too bad because she was right on my tail all the time we had a friendly rivalry
3984059 i didnt know if it was a rumor or actually true
3984060 i never in the world expected to be there i had just had a good swimming day
3984061 there was quite a crowd in the middle of the night the whole town knew about it

3984076 i dont see an increase to get back to that late 1990s to early 2000s level
3984077 i think its going to level out to where its at now

3984079 in the past you would see 25 to 30 homes a year in each plan and theyre all probably doing 10 to 15 homes a year now

3984136 diving is not here to support canada on its own
3984137 the games have just started people are still training for their events theyre still competing and the medals are going to come
3984138 i think any time you put up 10 runs in a game its a good one
3984139 i would have loved the medal the first medal for canada would have been awesome to have
3984140 i couldnt pull it through but that doesnt mean we wont be having one soon
3984141 the first fencer i fought had a very strong technique which better suited my fencing style i prefer attacks which give me more time to react

3984155 mungkin ada kesalahpahaman dan kekeliruan yang terjadi namun hal seperti itu terjadi di organisasi besar ketika anda membuat perubahan perubahan itu bukan masalah
3984156 pada dasarnya kita harus membuat para pemain sadar bahwa saya memegang kendali dan saya akan membuat keputusan keputusan yang mempengaruhi para pemain
3984157 jika pemain pergi maka keputusan untuk itu hanya berada di tangan saya itulah posisi kami dan saya pikir semua orang mengerti situasi ini
3984158 orang orang barangkali khawatir bahwa tak ada dana tersedia untuk saya membeli pemain pemain ke klub ini saya sudah diyakinkan bahwa kasusnya tidak seperti itu kami aktif mengejar pemain

3984169 this 8 point drop represents billions of dollars in sales that are not being injected into the normal shopping sectors for consumers
3984170 this would suggest that we are starting to see signs that consumers are store and channel shifting
3984171 and it represents a huge opportunity for many retailers now is the time of year to make those all important introductions to new customers and make overtures to an established customer base we will see which retailers know how to make new friends and hold on to their old ones
3984172 in terms of achieving differentiation its hard to underestimate the importance of the food element
3984173 consumers are naturally drawn to unique signature menu items when the chain can also layer in excitement through new or limited time offerings they help create an environment where consumers want to come back a good experience can generate all important buzz around the concept
3984174 you have private money going in to the arena so you have an additional set of eyes
3984175 the sea should make sure that somebody takes the lead on this and is responsible for the final approval if its design if its architectural if its engineering
3984176 its hard to place an 8 year old dog so thats great
3984177 so far it has been a wonderful help and were just so grateful
3984178 i try to pick ones i think will react well to being passed around
3984179 but this is also a way to help us out
3984180 we need to get the word out that if city residents lose a dog or a cat they should come here right away
3984181 trucks roll in constantly and we get thousands of animals
3984182 can the chairman let the department director answer the question
3984183 lack of civility we cannot insult women at the table to ask for a gender equity study
3984184 unfortunate that the president of council behaved like he did its not the first time in public or private
3984185 what we most hope will happen when city council gets together on monday is that everybody will have taken a deep breath and council and the mayors office can find a way to fund the study
3984186 it was most exciting to come through the locks and dam and see the discovery and our staff with their fresh new riverquest shirts and the yachts with friends and family cheering us on
3984187 we made a victory tour up the rivers a vision becoming a reality is very satisfying
3984188 making it a green boat added a million to the cost
3984189 i think the boat is symbolic of the transformation of pittsburgh and i hope the community embraces it and sees pittsburgh in a way the world sees it
3984190 i have contacted many members of the westmoreland county republican committee and there is overwhelming support for ms ward myself included
3984191 after much thought and consideration and many calls asking me to enter the partys nomination process to replace sen regola i have decided to do so
3984192 but this unexpected turn of events and outpouring of calls of encouragement from friends and strangers has led me to believe it is something that needed to be done
3984193 with great doubts about whether or not their interests are being represented in harrisburg
3984194 its going to be a broadly participatory project engaging as many citizens as possible in envisioning the future of the region
3984195 its about developing shared goals for the region what we want to be and aspire to
3984196 what is the road map we aspire to and how will we get there
3984197 it could be education health culture the subject matter is much more open to what people say they want to do
3984198 theres no reason if we do it really well and the technology is available not to involve tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands and involve them meaningfully in this process
3984199 the region isnt just pittsburgh or allegheny county or even southwestern pennsylvania its broader than that
3984200 we have a shared history economy culture pittsburgh is the capital of that broad region
3984201 its a safer deal we can sleep better at night
3984202 a lot of innocent people will be hurt a lot of jobs will be lost and a lot of revenue and its going to be an eyesore
3984203 i think its going to be good for the region its up to the gaming board now to go through and vet all those issues and get it in writing
3984204 not intended to provide an open fair and objective public process but instead to speedily cover its tracks
3984205 this environment that has surrounded the change in ownership has given the distinct impression that this decision is a fait accompli especially given the behind the scenes lobbying by prominent elected officials
3984206 this is not an inside job of any sort people came to us because the project was in financial trouble we happened to have been vetted greg carlin and i and we happened to have the financial resources to get it going the equity thats desperately needed
3984207 i thought about this on a thursday and on monday i was open for business
3984208 i hear people say dont throw that away take it to the shop
3984209 its not usually a problem because if we get a couch its gone the same day
3984210 the one thing we can never get enough of is dishes pots and pans bowls and glasses
3984211 has been a blessing i used to be on the street not homeless but out doing things i shouldnt i was never the kind of person who was used to dealing with people and this shop has helped me tolerate different types its been a big help to me
3984212 the no strings shop is the stuff all my grandkids have things from here id be lost without it
3984213 if she thought there was abuse it would be easy for us to tighten things up
3984214 this is a resident driven effort and the fact that we have a group of residents assisting other residents is a gem and a godsend for us
3984215 there are opportunities for resident owned businesses but i think for them its giving back something they do from the kindness of their hearts
3984216 people come from all over and they donate from all over
3984217 but i never had any dream about doing this it was just an idea that made sense
3984218 could they really tabulate the votes and get organized by then i doubt it i think the whole thing is to get e mail addresses and some positive p r
3984219 i was very disappointed as you wrote they played it for laughs imogen was acted very well given the direction but she was directed to act like paris hilton which i found insulting to the play
3984220 they greatly cut what to me is the apex the beautiful elegy that aviragus and guiderius say over fidele fear not the heat o th sun
3984221 since everything was so comical some of the most moving lines got a laugh and there was no sense that cymbeline had discovered the virtues of tolerance and humility i wish i could see again the wonderful production in london last summer where imogen was portrayed as a tormented figure torn between love and fealty to father and husband pardon the rant but i really love that play
3984222 as long as i can remember some pittsburghers have referred to washington pa as little but never as little are we so close to the big one that a distinction must be made
3984223 subscription sales remain strong particularly given the ongoing economic news we seem to be on track to grow subscribers for the fourth year
3984224 these insufferable yankee fans are laughing at this recent trade where they got marte and nady they seem to look at it more like the bully stealing the weak kids milk money than a fair trade i hope one of the boys the bucs got in return proves them wrong but im a bit dubious
3984225 cant wait to come in and see it and hopefully do it on a weekend when the steelers are in town hotels could package the weekend as demise of steel rise of the steelers if folks would tailgate before one of my shows id know ive made it
3984226 finally the long anticipated by me american premiere of cherry smoke in nyc clockwork theatre company who did three readings in may is going to produce it in february i truly believe that if it wasnt for patrick jordan and barebones greasing the skids with knockout reviews in scotland i would still be trying to get this play up cherry is headed to australia in fall 09 and we are in discussions with theatres in d c and chicago or maybe the times will crucify it and i can tuck the script back under my bed info at
3984227 bulldog is my favorite play of mine and just happens to have a wonderfully nasty irish grandfather role for bingo omalley tailgating aside for a kid from pittsburgh ill really know ive made it when bingo is in one of my shows

3984229 well be going now im telling you and the time youll be feeling the cold and the frost and the great rain and the sun again and the south wind blowing in the glens youll not be sitting up on a wet ditch the way youre after sitting in this place making yourself old with looking on each day and it passing you by

3984235 i was being typecast as a character actor the girl from kerry
3984236 thats where my music comes in i listen to myself on tape over and over
3984237 joe dowling always said you have to treat synge like shakespeare as heightened reality
3984238 its poetic not naturalistic when you dont engage the language but sit on it plebian and everyday it goes flat its no coincidence that synges first love was music too
3984239 he said his cock was about as long as his fingers but it changed before it spit to be as long as his hand and as thick as three fingers

3984248 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage

3984260 the most popular tool at the place where i worked before serena was the office organisational chart people like to know what is going on and who works where
3984261 facebook was a free tool for us to use and we could get going with it right away it let us expose our interests to other folks in the building and find out things we might have in common with them
3984262 one per cent of staff might abuse it but why stop everyone else from using it there are millions of other ways that people might be wasting time in the office banning it is very short sighted
3984263 people at home use social networking tools but what happens when they go to work they want to try to carry that on we combine productivity tools with social networking techniques and we do this in a very business focused way we are helping to make people work better
3984264 someone suggested we try applying social networking and having got over the initial repulsion we really started to think about it and could see that it would work

3984270 i dont remember exactly how we got involved with lionell
3984271 i do remember him coming to the house and sitting down with us
3984272 i had an older brother merv who played basketball in college but it was the first time my parents had gone through anything like that with football he talked to us about things to look for and questions to ask it was an eye opening session and helped prepare me for what was to follow
3984273 scholarships vs drugs program for student athletes and band members
3984274 ive even given my presentation to high school bowling team members
3984275 that was a great challenge for me and a rewarding one i got a standing ovation
3984276 its also important that the recruit understands that once they sign that letter of intent the coaching staff can move them to another position
3984277 so they need to ask about the chances of that happening
3984278 what i try to do is give them insight into how to become more marketable what they need to do with their grades why they might fit in better at this school than at that school ultimately its their choice i just try to educate them on what the process is like
3984279 that doesnt mean i wouldnt go in and do a home visitation if im asked
3984280 i try to keep those to an hour as well but there have been times when parents will keep me for an extra hour or so asking questions
3984281 what i try to do is educate the student athlete and his family about the recruiting process give them an idea of what to expect when the recruiter comes into their home and make them aware that there are questions they should ask
3984282 i didnt know about most of the stuff he was telling me
3984283 the ncaa has a lot of guidelines and i just try to educate the student athlete and his family about what they are
3984284 the more education i can provide them the better prepared they will be to make a decision
3984285 there is a lot of information out there and kids are so much more aware of things these days
3984286 but there are still people who wouldnt know a lot about the recruiting process if it wasnt for someone like lionell
3984287 and if you are able to help out one kid well then its worthwhile id say there is a place out there for what he does

3984289 crude has regained some of its losses over the past few trading sessions reacting to the inventory report which showed very substantial stock draws in gasoline said victor shum an analyst with energy consultancy purvin and gertz in singapore
3984290 concerns about the us economy and now the spread of the economic slowdown to europe and asia could push crude oil pricing to test lower lows because some of the supply issues have been discounted by the market mr shum said
3984291 the supply issues should really become relevant again at some point and this is likely to backstop the drop in oil pricing he said
3984292 these issues have not disappeared they have simply been discounted
3984293 at a start price of 99 cents and of course with no reserve
3984294 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
3984295 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
3984296 ebay does connect colourful buyers with colourful sellers and i wouldnt be surprised if someone did buy these items though i couldnt speculate on who would buy them or why
3984297 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage
3984298 it cannot however be confident that these efforts will generate funds sufficiently quickly for it to meet all of its obligations as they fall due over the coming weeks and months
3984299 i believe the archbishop of canterbury has expressed a desire to come to the united states and do some fundraising work
3984300 i definitely didnt see this coming to tell you the truth got to go down there and play
3984301 they said i was going to move around and get me into the lineup any way they could but that obviously didnt happen
3984302 i think it would definitely work my way if that happened im open to that
3984303 its been an awesome few months kind of like a rollercoaster really
3984304 coming from fresno and everything that happened there to signing now with the pirates just awesome im really excited
3984305 yeah i think it will you try not to think about how many people are watching though you just go out there and play baseball
3984306 i worked my changeup a little more and i was really happy with how i threw it
3984307 hes coming into his own hes a stud im glad hes on our team i wouldnt want to face him you just look at those six inning starts alone and you see that consistency thats a stud
3984308 hes been just outstanding for us and he was again tonight
3984309 honestly to me its just going out there and doing my job
3984310 its not about having a breakout season or anything i put the pressure on myself to be successful
3984311 well my goal is to pitch better than the night before
3984312 hopefully everyone will pick it up and outdo me nothing would be better than that
3984313 the left side of their infield is really alert because hes throwing sinkers and changeups
3984314 hes been great lately but he got some defensive help and they turned some double plays
3984315 i really just wanted to go deeper in the game and the strikeouts get my pitch count up
3984316 i think its just a matter of mixing pitches and letting the defense make the plays i went right after them and stayed ahead the home runs those happen i just kept pitching
3984317 my power is to center and thats where youre going to see me hit here
3984318 i know this park is great for lefties who pull but thats not my game

3984321 he asked me to have sex with him but i rejected
3984322 i know a lot of people will say that but hes really mature well beyond his years in terms of coaching knowledge its what he was destined to do
3984323 i couldnt ask for a better opportunity at the age im at and let alone a better program to start out with
3984324 its a great opportunity to have a lot of great players on that team and i really think we can do a lot of good things this year
3984325 it couldnt have worked out better from the standpoint of having him right now finishing up his masters degree so he is still living at home we not only get to face each other on the court but on a daily basis
3984326 nobody that ive been able to talk to can remember a father and son coaching against each other in an area high school game let alone in the same section
3984327 i knew i wanted basketball to be a part of my life for as long as i can remember
3984328 i either wanted to play or coach i think i wanted to coach more to be like my dad he was a role model and when i was little i wanted to be like he was
3984329 as a coachs son he had a little more insight than an average player
3984330 from the time he was in high school he was doing things other high school kids werent
3984331 he would be home breaking down film during his sophomore junior and senior years the past four years hes been helping me in practice

3984337 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful

3984339 in widelands you are the regent of a small tribe
3984340 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3984341 we expect russia to honour its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance
3984342 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbours occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3984343 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions

3984373 the glow of nbcs olympics coverage ratings victory threatens to be sullied by reports that the beijing olympic committee and the network have been less than scrupulous in their presentation of the summer games
3984374 newsworthy cracks coming to light in the great wall of olympics coverage
3984375 some footage had been produced before the opening ceremony to provide theatrical effect
3984376 some of them were genuinely produced some maybe were used from previously recorded material

3984385 as a writer elsa morante always focused on the traumas of despotic egotistical and narcissistic love
3984386 while it is very disturbing to have something like this happen where you live it is a relief to know that organizations like now are there to have an immediate useful reaction

3984414 i dont think the numbers are signaling the type of deep recessions we saw in the late 1990s and early 2001
3984415 any slowdown in the japanese economy is likely to be relatively modest
3984416 we never launched coverage in those countries because we simply werent satisfied with the map data we had available

3984420 longs is the type of store in summer thats going to carry 50 different types of sun hats and have a garden department i would go to longs to buy gifts because they had a lot of neat stuff
3984421 we love this company but we believe to continue to provide the service and care our customers expect from longs and continue to provide great career opportunities for our people and earn our shareholder return this was the best course of action
3984422 it was necessary to merge with a national player because increasingly we compete with national players
3984423 we really worked hard to join with a company that has the same commitment to the community and its employees that longs has
3984424 as the market gets more dominated by cvs and caremark the independent pharmacies are really on the outside looking in with no leverage whatsoever
3984425 its not that i wouldnt shop at cvs but given the choice id go to longs
3984426 we go through this life but once if theres anything we can do or help we can give let us do it now because we may not pass this way again
3984427 none are conventional mls vendors we think what we can build is something based on technology used by sites like trulia zillow google
3984428 too many agents had to join multiple mlses in contiguous markets
3984429 they were based on historical mls boundaries that had no relationship to the marketplace
3984430 the white population is older and very much centred around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
3984431 the future of america is epitomised by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future

3984433 as oil prices come off people just feel a bit better about the outlook for economic growth and its positive for consumer confidence

3984435 although i work in the financial services industry and am frequently wearing a suit i dont consider myself to be a typical suit dude

3984490 youd have to be quite a writer to do justice to this mans story and if you read
3984491 all human progress has depended on new questions rather than on new answers to the old questions
3984492 if the tamils cry for separatism is given up the two communities could solve their problems and continue to live in amity and dignity

3984505 toads of glory slugs of joy sang groin the dwarf as he trotted jovially down the path before a great dragon ate him because the author knew that this story was a train wreck after he typed the first few words

3984507 have you ever felt you werent being told the truth
3984508 i do not undertake to promote welfare for i propose to extend freedom my aim is not to pass laws but to repeal them it is not to inaugurate new programs but to cancel old ones that do violence to the constitution
3984509 have you ever felt you werent being told the truth
3984510 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3984511 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3984512 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3984513 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3984514 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3984515 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3984516 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3984517 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
3984518 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
3984519 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
3984520 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
3984521 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
3984522 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3984523 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3984524 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3984525 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3984526 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3984527 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3984528 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3984529 the answer is a qualified yes at least for many people and for many visual needs

3984537 the value of every piece of human communication is rooted in the fact that god speaks

3984539 the good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks
3984540 what i speak is directly related to what i want my words are one means i use to get what is important to me
3984541 only when i submit to the rule of god who has a perfect plan and is in complete control will i begin to live and speak as he has purposed the war of words is at bottom a war for sovereignty
3984542 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has passed away behold the new has come all this is from god who through christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation that is in christ god was reconciling the world to himself not counting their trespasses against them and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation therefore we are ambassadors for christ god making his appeal through us we implore you on behalf of christ be reconciled to god for our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of god

3984544 this survey has told us not surprisingly that the quality of life for the vast majority of patients was to be as expected or better after laser vision correction surgery
3984545 even patients who reported complications indicated that they would have the surgery again
3984546 lasik is one of the safest procedures when performed under the guidance of the right surgeon the two main complications that occur in patients are symptoms of dryness and night vision issues such as halos and glare both of these complications in our experience are largely preventable today because of the latest advancements in the technology and matching the right patient to the right procedure patients need to spend more time on selecting the best doctor and not be swayed by low prices or the fact that their doctor is on television
3984547 lasik is still a serious surgery and should be approached like you would any other surgical procedure

3984553 we had just paid the admission and were sitting watching the film on nixons life in the dark theater when it happened
3984554 first we felt and heard a very large bump like the whole building jumped a foot and came back down and then the shaking started we saw a couple of small pieces of ceiling tile fall and fine white specks of ceiling fell on our hair and clothes
3984555 i smiled over at my husband i thought it was the theaters special effects
3984556 i just felt disbelief how could this be happening im from florida

3984558 i think that most companies lack the skills to add internet collaboration tools to their environments particularly those that have traditionally focused on back end processing rather than front end applications
3984559 they are beginning to hire younger people who have the skills but they still need the corporate blessing to do something with them in the short term they usually hire some geeks from a company that has three people to help develop the applications
3984560 we have seen renewed interest in all things internet as a result of web 2 0 technologies but the kind of training people are asking for is less about understanding the issues and applications involved and more about effective communication and why and what is effective rather than how to do it
3984561 it is a new course area so was always going to be a bit more popular but we have noticed a lot of demand for podcasting which is surprising because it is almost an old technology for web 2 0 though people ask for videocasting as well
3984562 i know that these countries they need help all kinds of help and when you come to a developed country i had the chance to train in good universities like mcgill universitys surgery ive been working in an excellent hospital here in sherbrooke and i feel it is my obligation to give some time and expertise to these poor populations

3984567 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products
3984568 but i am actually very impressed with the spanish media in terms of their news coverage they have a built in commitment to getting out a lot of information on health issues especially with diabetes
3984569 when asked about why they lack a usual provider 41 percent say the principal reason is that they are seldom sick

3984577 the lhc is a particle accelerator which has been built deep underground in a 27 km tunnel under switzerland and france

3984587 theres a lot of hysteria that the turmoil in the credit market will mean students cant get loans
3984588 but students should be thinking really hard about whether they should be taking out private loans in the first place

3984595 i came all the way from connecticut for this interview so id really appreciate it if we could have it today
3984596 but on the bright side jackie was just up here asking if we could raise the salary for the job to meet your requirements
3984597 those are results im asking you to look at to make sure theyre interpreted correctly
3984598 why didnt you include a paragraph about third party insurers
3984599 and youll pay for the cab and get reimbursed later
3984600 i know jackie has a lack of people skills i know hes unreasonable i know he can be nasty if hes really making you uncomfortable you owe it to yourself to get another job
3984601 but dont you think its wrong the way he talks to people
3984602 my boss helen talks to me that way every day
3984603 a lot of the frameworks and walls built because of the old financial world we grew up in will come down
3984604 people think theyre diversifying by investing in a country and it leads to inadequate diversification

3984615 w e wanted the album to just be something you could hold closer to your heart and still be fun
3984616 end of school song like schoolies but more epic than the real thing
3984617 i think we were just ready to do it we were a lot more focused on this album and we kind of needed to take the reins a little bit we had a much clearer idea of what we wanted to do you know youre your own harshest critic and once someone else is saying thats fine you kind of just go along with it if youre judging your own performance and trying to better yourself you really take it more seriously
3984618 were quite hands on but lately weve been trying to work with people that we already like were just trying to put a bit more trust in people we want to trust instead of being so super controlling were testing ourselves i guess because sometimes we get super involved and we forget that there are people that its their job to make videos and its their job to make artwork i think this time we wanted it to be our job to make music
3984619 we got a guy who were a huge fan of to do our artwork and we wouldnt normally get that opportunity to commission an artwork from one of your favourite painters but because were in a band we get to do it its kind of nice to put your trust into someone and for them to do a nice job sometimes you put your trust in people and they do a terrible job laughs
3984620 we never collaborate especially writing songs theres just the three of us once you hear someone elses voice or their idea for a harmony it opens up a whole new world
3984621 i know alana and patience think so but im not sure how other people will see it as clearly as we do but it definitely feels more grown up
3984622 its stripped back whien its live its a hundred times louder than it would ever be on a stereo as soon as something is really loud you lose the intricacies anyway so you dont have to play them
3984623 especially at the smaller venues no one really does anything exciting no one really brings in any props or puts trees on stage anything like that so i think it feels a bit more special especially for the people that come into a place where it might be their local bar in bunbury they see it every week and it looks exactly the same and then they come in for a show and its like a different place because theres so much extra stuff there i think thats when its the most special
3984624 one time we had twenty people on stage at this 200 capacity show just dancing all over the stage pulling leads out my guitar wasnt working it was frightening laughs
3984625 a house party but like a house party where its not your house so you can go wild like kick in a letter box

3984633 a foreign agent working on behalf of the government of georgia
3984634 mccains previous campaigning to bring georgia into nato in part on the frankly lunatic basis that georgia is
3984635 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3984636 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3984637 the lost sea started as my own solo acoustic project
3984638 it felt boring to play like the songs were empty so i wanted to expand the sound and make it more dynamic
3984639 i was listening to the promise ring and pedro the lion all that stuff on jade tree records and also older guys like tom petty and johnny cash
3984640 my friends told me i should go see how people feel about the songs and start hitting up open mics acousticafe is a supportive environment where everyone wants to get better you can go up to someone like brad yoder who has played acoustic for a while everyone there has been really great and helped me out a lot
3984641 he had seen us live and a few weeks later i mentioned to him that we were working on an ep recorded with jake hanner of the band donora he jumped right on it and asked if we wanted to put it out on atomic family i really respect what hes doing trying to bring the scene together its amazing how they started a label out of basement recordings in his house they had their own booth for three dates on the warped tour its impressive that hes working so hard
3984642 we are playing shows with some of those bands and we definitely fit in with their sound
3984643 music as a form of entertainment has its place but sound affects us on more levels than any other sense
3984644 so weve mostly been involved in music thats functional on a lot of levels
3984645 crystal bowl meditation a vibratory journey into deep meditative states
3984646 the best thing about it was the distribution it opened up corridors that would have been closed to us i think it was directly through our involvement with koch that we became visible enough for others to find us
3984647 theyre some of the nicest people weve ever spoken to finally we found a label that wants to work with the artist it was wonderful to be appreciated on our own terms without compromise we did our recording with no interference from them
3984648 the beauty is not in writing the music but subtracting the music knowing that theres a note there what does the note say and how important is it can we say the same thing with just the space were letting the listener become an active participant on a subconscious level of completing the composition and the only way to do that from a musicians point of view is to remove the ego and know that its not what you play but how the listener processes it
3984649 its pure quartz crystal pulverized and reconstructed into a bowl fused with a really hot electrical arc
3984650 the ones we use are specifically pitched for music but they represent some of the oldest instruments in any culture whether its a gong or a drum or just the feminine shape while also reflecting the highest form of technology from the information age
3984651 when im playing im fully aware of the vibrations that are affecting the listeners physical emotional and spiritual so i pay attention and get immersed in it the vibration comes through me and is emitted out just like a silicon chip is used to pull in energy hold it and broadcast it out thats what the crystals do
3984652 it was a traditional instrument but with effects i was using it in an electronic way because i was just bored with the electronic instruments available in the 80s and 90s
3984653 when i play the moog synthesizer theres such a deep rooted connection for people that it brings up memories and possibilities
3984654 im physically playing electricity with a guitar you always know what thats going to sound like but with a synth youre not only playing music youre recreating the sound every time you power it up
3984655 they feel like they are going places but its actually an expansion of their reality of who they are their consciousness goes beyond the 3 d limitations of the material world we all live in and when youre in that space youre able to heal the body can regenerate energize and recharge
3984656 when we do our sound healing meditations it lasts an hour and people feel blissed out
3984657 a common comment has been i wish you could play all night
3984658 usually when you go to a concert youre physically active but with sleep concerts youre active in a subconscious way we want to create a kind of sonic geography for the listeners to freely roam and explore
3984659 it was daylight until 11 oclock at night and we played to indigenous tribal people
3984660 but you can be in a real mellow space the first set will be globally beat based the out breath then we take a break and move into dreamland
3984661 everything ive ever done has been about trying to push the boundaries of whats expected
3984662 we hope that this sleep concert is successful because we would love to do more of them
3984663 well develop expertise and learn better ways to handle those cases and the issues they present
3984664 i anticipate seeing some people who used to be residents there
3984665 basically what obama manages to do with something as simple as the text message announcements is not only tap into younger voters but he creates a giant database of cell phone numbers and e mails that he can tap into later
3984666 i think on some level if it works its brilliant
3984667 certainly the theme could point to sen joe biden but there are a lot of potential names out there i could give you a list of 20 people who that theme could point to
3984668 no other campaign has done this before you can be part of this important moment
3984669 a lot of people live and die with their cell phones
3984670 if he has all those cell phone numbers at his fingertips thats a great resource
3984671 every judas priest album has had its own character really we were just kicking ideas around we talked about a concept album for quite a while and our manager suggested we look into the life of nostradamus which we did we were aware of prophesies which most people are but we didnt realize how interesting his life was he suffered a lot of tragedy in his life and was exiled from the church and had to start a new life that combined with his visions and prophesies made for a good story
3984672 when we started we pretty much had a mountain to climb the actual composition wasnt that difficult because we had a lot of ideas but to tell a story chronologically and lyrically and musically and make it work all the moods work and preludes because there are 13 primary tracks and 24 tracks in all that was the difficult part
3984673 people can compare it to whatever they want after nearly 40 years in the business if you dont have a sense of humor or a reality check were not really worried about what people compare us to
3984674 were doing about three numbers from the new album and well probably add more as we go along we didnt want to play too much from it until people get used to it cause its quite a bit to take in really and then next year were looking to play it in its entirety at special events special venues around the world
3984675 we started after thin lizzy and bands like that but i think we were the first band that had a duel lead guitar attack with trade offs and searing solo harmonies i think we introduced that to metal and paved the way for that style of music but we cant pat ourselves on the back and say we came out with that its just what we did it was a natural progression
3984676 tracks like that made us a household name if you like
3984677 but again weve always believed there was room for melody in metal and theres room for far more in metal than people give it credit for weve always tried to push the boundaries of metal to give us more room to maneuver and to give other bands more room to maneuver as well
3984678 a lot of singers the older they get their voice starts to deteriorate robs has stayed the same were fortunate that were all still in shape in a million years i never thought wed be around this long
3984679 i thought the show was pretty lamo his set list was strange and he appeared out of place with the younger crowd who were more interested in texting and drinking beer than listening to his timeless lyrics i also thought his voice was pretty bad saturday night he did not appear to be engaged with the crowd at all
3984680 it is so great to see a 64 year old artist get critiqued for playing too many new songs and messing around with the arrangements of the crowd pleasers its what makes dylan dylan an artist not a crowd pleaser
3984681 our friend angelo bruni who is a vampire was the star of this flick
3984682 he promised to drink our blood and give us eternal life if we gave them the song called dinner du jour for the opening sequence we kept our end of the deal but
3984683 long before the band existed i was producing marlas solo tracks which had this down tempo trance ish character to it
3984684 eventually it became obvious that her writing and my producing just clicked marlas musical interests span from ethereal pop through 60s groove and her bizarre love for surf music meshed quite strangely with my world of electronica goth and industrial
3984685 my adventure with indian sounding music started when i met jim dispirito of rusted root
3984686 i was fascinated with the sound of his tablas later while working on michael glabickis solo album as sound engineer i was further inspired by jims takes and i asked him to play on the track traveler then i wanted to take it a little further and started to think how to incorporate other indian instruments which all sound very mystical to me
3984687 a day later i was a proud owner of a semi pro instrument then i started to google i came upon sitar classes and various articles on how to tune it yes tuning a sitar is an art of its own being a guitar player adjusting to playing a sitar was quite painless except for proper sitting position if you never tried yoga you will hate it we used sitar on the song lotus which was written last and in 100 percent inspired by this instrument right now i am still learning how to play it and will continue to learn for god knows how long
3984688 the film like the original will focus on the lives of autorickshaw drivers in the city and will be a tribute to shankar nag fondly known as auto raja after the film of the same name auto raja has been one of the best kannada films ever made the title which is a license number will also play an important role in the film
3984689 there are only a few scenes in the film where the number plate of the auto rickshaw is shown and we have taken the same number as the title of our film
3984690 i didnt actually think it was my first no 1
3984691 somehow in my mind i dont know what the opposite of a state of denial was but i thought for sure i had a no 1 album somewhere along the way i thought hot august night was no 1 but then i was told it only went to no 2 so i was crestfallen
3984692 its a nice feeling to be no 1 i enjoyed every moment of the time that i was no 1 and i enjoyed the fact that people became aware that it was my first no 1 and they were a little amazed at that also im told that im also the oldest performer on billboard charts ever to have a no 1 album which amazes me i dont feel that old i feel very young but its nice to feel that in this market thats filled with young people or seems to be aimed at young people that an old geezer can come along and knock a few of them off their perches and say hey heres one for the senior citizens and we can kick a little butt too
3984693 the highs were that i was able to actually continue to write songs that i liked you always have that lingering doubt when you take on a project because ive been doing this since i was 16 years old and you just never do know whether something is going to come out you can make all the plans and you make the commitments and you sit down with your guitar and you hope that something worthwhile starts to take shape so that was a real high because i liked the songs that were coming and it was very encouraging and gave me a lot of hope it was a natural high
3984694 i dont want to get into it too deeply but my girl was going through a very difficult time after surgery and by the way shes much better now getting around and doing fine but when the album was being written she was in real trouble and i had a lot of conflicted feelings about trying to write music and create beautiful things while someone that i loved was going through such a difficult time so it was a low for me it was a challenge but somehow through somebody elses graces i was able to get through it
3984695 it really wasnt a duet until i was working with a little cassette player and my girlfriend was singing along with me while i was writing it which i didnt appreciate but she was in the background there when i listened back to it i thought yes this absolutely should have a girl singing there because it sounded great despite the fact that she cant sing a lick so that put that in my mind when i finished the song i spoke to rick about it and he immediately suggested natalie maines he said she was a great singer so we sent the record over to natalie i had done my verse done my vocal and she told me later that she called her manager before the record was finished and said i want to do it so we both went into the studio and we both sang the song again
3984696 the first time i met with him hes a pretty imposing guy physically hes a big man he has this huge beard and he looks very serious and very intense but it turns out hes really a pussycat hes a very sweet guy and hes totally involved in music and making beautiful music i think his strongest attribute is knowing when not to say anything and let the music take its own course and develop and grow of its own natural power i dont know he lets it happen and that to me is a great talent
3984697 i was never good enough to because to follow a trend you have to be able to know what the trend is you have to be able to copy it and you have to know enough about music to be a good imitator and ive never been that ive always had to follow my own thing because it was the only thing i could do it was the only thing i felt i could do well so i havent followed any trends to me trends dont exist the only trend is music either its good or its bad either its beautiful or its not either it involves the listener or it doesnt either it moves me when i perform it or not these are the considerations
3984698 no i like the way i was invented originally ive kind of gotten used to it this is just another step thats all ive been taking steps since the beginning from cherry cherry to i am i said to america to christmas music to home before dark its me im not reaching out for anybody but the audience that wants to listen thats all im not doing anything logical im not pre planning anything maybe i would have had a better career if i had and thought it out but it was all based on how well i could write the songs and how good the songs would be and how the audience took it to their hearts or not and its still that way exactly that way
3984699 there are a lot of talented people out there but to go for a long time and to try and remain productive thats i think in the hands of the gods luck has a lot to do with it ive seen more talented people than i fall by the side of the road road kill in a business and a world that can be very cynical and very difficult and has lots of traps and potholes so i do believe that good luck and maybe a little karma play a part in this whole scenario i also think that you have to absolutely be in love with what youre doing if you want to be around for a while because youre around for as long as you want to be around nobody will stop you from making music

3984749 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
3984750 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline

3984756 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
3984757 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

3984804 tenemos el nico aeropuerto en el mes de julio con un 16 de bajada que ha perdido pasajeros en toda espa a es un dato horrible
3984805 te ricamente han faltado tantos aviones como en el mes anterior y esta situaci n es insoportable porque una gran parte de los vuelos que se completan en santiago son con gente de nuestra ciudad
3984806 es un disparate que el alcalde de a coru a javier losada pueda llegar a hacerle caso en su prop sito de cargarse el aeropuerto
3984807 v zquez luch mucho por el aeropuerto y ahora llega la sensaci n que no se est n haciendo las cosas bien aunque estamos a tiempo de volver a cambiarlas
3984808 una a coru a sin el aeropuerto baja a la mitad se convierte en una ciudad poco representativa en el contexto socioecon mico espa ol
3984809 nosotros creemos que esto es un reflejo de la situaci n general que hay en espa a en todo caso hay que dotar al aeropuerto de m s medios y de m s vuelos para recuperar un tr fico normal que es el que corresponde a la ciudad de a coru a la m s poblada de galicia y la que m s viajeros deber a atraer
3984810 el aeropuerto sufre con m s crudeza la crisis general porque necesita m s inversiones por parte de la xunta el ministerio de fomento y de todas las administraciones p blicas implicadas
3984811 hasta ahora se han cumplido los datos exigidos por el plan director por razones ajenas al aeropuerto hay una ca da en las cifras aunque tambi n motivada por la falta de dinero invertido
3984812 es absurdo promocionar otros aeropuertos de la zona cuando en a coru a tenemos la gran mayor a del tr fico a reo de toda galicia
3984813 un alcalde como el de culleredo no puede poner en duda las obras de ampliaciones con estos comentarios sufre la zona m s pujante de galicia y en el fondo toda la comunidad aut noma lo que necesita alvedro es apoyo y una buena gesti n dentro del propio aeropuerto
3984814 es una noticia mala para la ciudad y por consiguiente para el sector de la hosteler a la p rdida de pasajeros en alvedro significa menos turistas y eso no es positivo
3984815 desde la direcci n xeral de turismo la xunta y el propio gobierno municipal hemos escuchado que est n trabajando en mejorar la situaci n y conseguir l neas nuevas les vamos a conceder el beneficio de la duda y darles tiempo para que act en para subsanar los problemas
3984816 lo m s importante es que alvedro tiene que funcionar bien y para ello necesitamos mejores infraestructuras para que a coru a est bien posicionada y la gente pueda venir
3984817 ser el competidor ol mpico m s galardonado de todos los tiempos ahora suena extra o decirlo no tengo absolutamente nada para decir me qued sin palabras
3984818 esto no ha terminado cualquier cosa puede suceder en las tres pr ximas pruebas no soy invencible nadie es invencible y cualquiera puede ganar
3984819 wie kann es m glich sein dass solch brutale und menschenunw rdige aufnahme rituale scheinbar schon seit jahren geduldet werden

3984832 programmes on community radio would be made to educate and inform farmers
3984833 it will tell farmers how to cope with natural calamities management of land water and pesticides in farming and to adopt new methods to increase their earning

3984836 es una cuesti n general y no podemos hacer un drama de esto
3984837 en todos los aeropuertos la situaci n de la subida del combustible y de los precios ha finalizado en una ca da general en todo el sector hay tiempo para la reacci n y para que se estabilice pero nunca ser un problema para el desarrollo del aeropuerto de alvedro
3984838 ni losada ni tello han estado a la altura de las circunstancias para convencer a las compa as de bajo coste para que se queden en el aeropuerto al no haber competencia con un segundo operador de los servicios en tierra los precios se han disparado y evidentemente repercute en el n mero de pasajeros
3984839 estamos francamente preocupados porque hay circunstancias que hacen que el plan director no arranque y que el futuro de alvedro sea incierto en primer lugar parece que alvedro no figura en el mapa de aeropuertos principales para el presidente del gobierno jos luis rodr guez zapatero
3984840 no se ha hecho absolutamente nada en relaci n a este aspecto
3984841 en segundo lugar el presidente de la xunta emilio p rez touri o est m s preocupado de otras cuestiones como dilucidar cu l ser la fecha de los comicios electorales auton micos
3984842 lo que queda pendiente es la revisi n del plan director para valorar cu ndo se puede ampliar la pista lo que hay que destacar es que durante ocho a os alvedro ha estado paralizado y tras la llegada al poder de zapatero ha sido cuando ha repuntado tambi n hay que valorar la gesti n del gobierno local se han conseguido grandes logros para alvedro
3984843 durante los ltimos tres a os es cuando se licitaron los permisos y ahora est n en construcci n las obras de mejora del aparcamiento para unas 2 500 plazas tambi n est en construcci n el aparcamiento para aeronaves el ils tambi n se hizo y se pavimentar toda la pista actual este verano en estos ltimos tres a os aument la demanda de pasajeros hubo m s frecuencia y posibilidades de vuelos
3984844 el plan director es una muestra m s de los errores de losada
3984845 la ltima noticia es que aena no se compromete a fijar plazos ni presupuestos para desarrollar el plan director y adem s aduce motivos t cnicos para no instalar el ils de categor a iii que nos dar a la fiabilidad que exigen los usuarios

3984851 its the love of the game i live for football
3984852 to have them cut me no matter how many times just made me go home hungrier and work out harder i get another opportunity to play football its a lot easier to return because i got to know the people that cuts some of the uncertainty out i just need to learn to hold my own

3984914 around ten years ago when i was in my final year at college a boy saw me in our college canteen and fell head over heels in love with me
3984915 he was so desperate that after we left he asked a waiter my name and the stupid waiter made the same mistake he told the boy my name was alka
3984916 no no i never noticed him must be one of those rich types just hanging out in our college ogling at girls he had fallen so madly in love with me that he tried to find out my address from our college office
3984917 he asked for alka and unfortunately there was an alka in my class so they gave him alkas address then the guy goes to his parents gives them the address and asks them to meet alkas parents and ask for her hand in marriage
3984918 they saw each other the boy realized his goof up and told her and described me accurately to her but alkas smart she wasnt going to let go of such a prize catch i dont know what she did maybe she told him there was no one like me in her college or that i was from some other college or some such yarn but she must have sure worked on him with all her wily charms and finally they did get married and now shes having a ball of a time loaded in dough the wife of a wealthy businessman while i slog it out alone day in and day out

3984921 she took me out to dinner in a restaurant remember i told you that the boy told her everything accurately described me to her she teased me that her husband still remembers me
3984922 i asked her i wanted to meet him but she made up some excuses shes scared after all a mans first love always has an enduring place in his heart
3984923 yes just one small ulka alka goof up and look at the consequences she glowing in matrimony in the lap of luxury and me in the abyss all alone

3984999 ancient egypt offered the best presently known source of data about the uncorrupted african past with enough data to not only verify the facts of african civilization but to begin the construction of a framework to reinterpret the history and social reality of the world
3985000 the true authors of greek philosophy were not the greeks but the people of north africa commonly called the egyptians
3985001 when the aryans invaded greece they were savages from neolitic europe and could not possibly have possessed the high artistic capacities and rich culture necessary for the unfolding of aegean civilization
3985002 in the beginnings of european literature few names are better known and none is older than that of ethiopia europes earliest poetry sings of no foreign people quite so romantic it geography records no country more distant and its efforts at history memorializes no nation thought more ancient than that designated by this celebrated name

3985004 i have tried to bring to view the common denominator in african culture as opposed to that of the northern aryan culture may this work contribute to strengthening of the feelings of goodwill which have always united africans from one end of the continent to the other and thus show our organic cultural unity
3985005 ancient egypt offered the best presently known source of data about the uncorrupted african past with enough data to not only verify the facts of african civilization but to begin the construction of a framework to reinterpret the history and social reality of the world
3985006 regardless of the cacophony of shrill and unbridled disingenuousness of most
3985007 in this volume facts of african history which have been for so long purposefully withheld from the public shall be revealed and carefully explained
3985008 egypt has created the greatest and most enduring of all ancient civilizations its remarkable achievements in the arts and sciences its influence upon the philosophy of both europe and asia is seldom denied few studies however admit the significant indeed predominant role of africans in the building of this civilization
3985009 this work begins where the history of the blacks began in egypt northern ethiopia and sudan southern ethiopia thus at the very outset i clash head on with the caucasian version of african history
3985010 our investigations have convinced us that the west has not been calm enough and objective enough to teach our history correctly without crude falsifications

3985034 without these details todays announcement is simply a mandate for heavier reliance on coal and gas which is not the way of the future
3985035 however we will not let the 90 percent target get in the way of security of supply
3985036 they want to borrow from future generations so that their fossil fuel friends can make more money today
3985037 its difficult to imagine a circumstance where the government could directly control interest rates without a whole range of adverse consequences occurring a whole range of other things mr tanner told abc radio
3985038 weve seen it in the past for example where we had a cap on interest rates
3985039 what that meant was that people ended up with cocktail loans for their homes where they borrowed a proportion of their mortgage at the official interest rate and had to borrow the rest at a really high interest rate much much higher than the official rate
3985040 now i wouldnt speculate about what they might be and of course its not my direct responsibility mr tanner said

3985049 some commentators have suggested the government establish an aussie mac as a mechanism to inject liquidity into the market and provide a price discovery function in times of severe market stress treasury executive director markets group jim murphy told a a federal parliamentary committee hearing in sydney
3985050 it appears that for some the aussie mac proposal is seen as a mechanism to address the current problems in securitisation markets
3985051 treasury strongly disagrees with this in that the treasurer has ruled out establishing a government body of this nature
3985052 we think its important to note that underlying australias rmbs markets are high quality assets and it is expected that once some normality returns to the market this will assist in accumulating demand for rmbs and restoring this funding channel
3985053 one can only speculate why superannuation funds are not involved in this but they make their own decisions
3985054 we have recently seen a decrease in the bank bill rate of approximately 40 basis points resulting in a fall of the cost of raising new funds he said
3985055 we saw the banks increase their interest rates when funding costs went up
3985056 on the same token we expect lenders to pass on any reduction in funding costs to their customers in a timely way

3985098 if you love something set it free if it comes back to you its yours if it doesnt it never was we do not possess anything in this world least of all other people we only imagine that we do our friends our lovers our spouses even our children are not ours they belong only to themselves possessive and controlling friendships and relationships can be as harmful as neglect
3985099 if you love something set it free if it comes back to you its yours
3985100 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3985101 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3985102 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3985103 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3985104 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3985105 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3985106 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3985107 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3985108 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3985109 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3985110 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3985111 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3985112 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3985113 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3985114 no s lo un buen presidente del partido dem crata en arkansas sino tambi n un apreciado amigo y confidente

3985117 nosotros estamos al tanto estamos ayudando en estos momentos a la polic a estatal
3985118 there is a great deal of confusion about what they can do
3985119 some lobbying firms have decided not to go to either of the conventions
3985120 while we have been active at political conventions in the past we dont have any plans at this point for the upcoming convention
3985121 if you are having a reception it has to be light appetizers no forks just toothpicks
3985122 i think this is preposterous frankly because i dont think it is the genesis of the problem the people who brought us this whole regulatory regime intend to interrupt the normal social interaction between and among those who do business together
3985123 it might sound a little ridiculous but the intent was to stop the one on one sit down dinners between a lobbyist and lawmakers which was the trade of currency of jack abramoff who is now in prison for bribing members of congress
3985124 in general under minnesota law legislators and constitutional officers cannot take gifts from registered lobbyists
3985125 we have been working with our legal counsel at faegre amp benson
3985126 the really bigger issue is not so much whether or not a congressman is going to stuff his face with shrimp on a toothpick
3985127 an incredibly good opportunity for lobbyists and special interests to really mingle with members of congress and have serious face time with them
3985128 when we find out we will have the clients legal counsel review it to make sure everything passes muster
3985129 when inflations taking us up 10 12 14 percent then we kind of have to get creative
3985130 we have to make sure that were not wasting money and were not getting frills we have to make sure were getting the basic things that we need to run a first class program
3985131 were not to the breaking point yet and hopefully we wont be
3985132 that alone will be able to save us thousands of dollars
3985133 but now everybodys seen the sense of urgency and said lets get
3985134 you may just have to go out and wash a few cars

3985140 every artist is a narcissist this does not mean that he is vain it only means that he is hopelessly self absorbed
3985141 over the last few years sothebys sales of contemporary asian art have become increasingly successful in all our international sales locations hong kong new york london and paris
3985142 new york remains extremely important to the market of contemporary asian art
3985143 since we launched auctions in this category in new york in 2006 we have been delighted with the response and we will continue to hold pre sale exhibitions of our hong kong sales in this key geographic location this collecting category has become truly international over the past few years and we have a strong international team of specialists who currently and will continue to work with our clients in all our key locations with this move sothebys strategy of sourcing globally and selling centrally becomes fully realized in the important and growing field of contemporary asian art

3985148 cabinet will look at what further measures will be possible to reduce the pressure on a system
3985149 there is much much more to be done and we are working hard on this
3985150 the core reason for the pressure on the system being we are in the middle of an appallingly low level of rainfall and i cant make it rain
3985151 you cant turn the queen mary around to be sailing in a particular direction for the last 12 years in six months

3985154 if the senate does conduct an additional review it is essential its terms of reference are broad ranging to achieve real outcomes for indigenous australians
3985155 we have to take the politics out of this debate
3985156 in order to achieve a lasting impact a review by the senate would need to consider historical funding arrangements for indigenous services since 1978
3985157 it would need to assess the backlog in health education housing and infrastructure and determine whether commonwealth funding support is adequate
3985158 crude has regained some of its losses over the past few trading sessions reacting to the inventory report which showed very substantial stock draws in gasoline said victor shum an analyst with energy consultancy purvin and gertz in singapore
3985159 concerns about the us economy and now the spread of the economic slowdown to europe and asia could push crude oil pricing to test lower lows because some of the supply issues have been discounted by the market mr shum said
3985160 the supply issues should really become relevant again at some point and this is likely to backstop the drop in oil pricing he said
3985161 these issues have not disappeared they have simply been discounted
3985162 the mustang is an outstanding value and it satisfies owners from the six cylinder buyer all the way up to the muscle car guy whos driving a shelby 500kr
3985163 it really speaks to the quality of mustang and its status as an american icon
3985164 the mustang is a symbol of power performance and coolness and anyone who owns one knows that they are a part of something special a piece of americana that goes back 45 years
3985165 from bullitt to cal special to gt500 to warriors in pink to the pony package there is a mustang for every taste
3985166 the mustang v 6 offers best in class fuel economy sporting 26 miles per gallon on the highway
3985167 and for serious enthusiasts we have mustangs that provide serious horsepower a 5 4 liter supercharged v 8 is available with 500 hp and 480 foot pounds of torque
3985168 it seems like it doesnt have that feeling of direction
3985169 if someone were elected by the entire community they would be speaking for the entire city hopefully
3985170 the cultural park the red sox you can pick any issue we are dealing with right now and ask how an elected mayor would have made a difference
3985171 the negative criticism is that he or she is in office for four years and will run amok and pursue issues that are not in the best interest of the public
3985172 it is also a good amount of time to do something good
3985173 it is a combination of a strong mayor and a council city manager form of government
3985174 that is definitely the direction that a lot of communities are taking if they change their structure
3985175 it was a very very good day for the community
3985176 if this is something where other people were involved they know from the newspaper accounts that the police think other people were involved
3985177 so if they were to run they would run by now
3985178 the state is not about to make a deal with anybody unless their back is really to the wall
3985179 the biggest thing in these sorts of cases a person has to bargain with is their life
3985180 most people know what dna is and they trust dna
3985181 i would much rather that coralrose be in second or third grade at toledo blade elementary school
3985182 its an article of faith for journalists and most others in the media industry privacy laws are bad and therefore implicitly bad for freedom of the press
3985183 the recommendation to introduce a tort of privacy could be likened to hitting a nut with a sledgehammer
3985184 elevated in some quarters into the right to do anything
3985185 some famous guy is going to talk about the pretty things here
3985186 teh is so common its a joke in games journalism
3985187 if you really like something you might use teh and a bunch of superlatives and a couple ones instead of exclamation points
3985188 a months difference could very well mean a job a couple taxis out of service i dont think that serves anyones best interest
3985189 a double blind parallel multicenter comparison of l acetylcarnitine with placebo on the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in fragile x syndrome boys

3985191 was the soldier who left his weapon lying around court martialed
3985192 we are positionally holy god has saved us through his son jesus but we are not practically holy
3985193 if you dont have a concept of gods holiness you wont understand pursuing practical holiness
3985194 jesus has redeemed you from a life of silliness and folly he said
3985195 you were saved to pursue holiness why in the world would you want to go back to your old way of living
3985196 hide it in your heart you must have unhurried and unhindered time with god in the word
3985197 holy people go out bragging about god dont isolate yourself do good deeds among the gentiles
3985198 in america we are a culture of african american christians caucasian christians hispanic christians asian christians and on and on
3985199 that isnt scriptural and you know i dont want to limit jesus to just my culture
3985200 if you are going to south america to work with a people group you dont know anything about you google it and find out what they eat what they wear how they speak how they act
3985201 you are excited you want to know everything you dont want to offend anyone
3985202 in effect we are saying that our own culture is more important than jesus
3985203 christ called us not to be ethnics but to be christians
3985204 one man asked me if i was prepared for a hostile takeover
3985205 im just as strong as i was when i played football
3985206 the brady boys are so perfect we hope our kids take after them
3985207 you need to make your presence known to people in places such as the student affairs office
3985208 if they know you are there and are willing to help it will be beneficial
3985209 we need to attract some of the top students on our campuses but we also need to attract the people who wouldnt have anyone else if they didnt have us
3985210 about 99 percent of our college students in new england are unchurched
3985211 all they know about christianity is what theyve seen through the media which is nearly always negative we hear the most positive portrayal on television about christians is the simpsons evangelism for us is a huge challenge
3985212 we have a bcm presence on 275 campuses but our state convention only has about 240 churches
3985213 we tell them hey guys its good here on campus but you need to get plugged in with a church too
3985214 you want the student the finished bcm product to be a christian involved in his church
3985215 let them look at you and see that you are involved in your church as an individual
3985216 i teach a sunday school class and am on committees at my church and they know that
3985217 one thing arliss said that really struck me was that our face will be the face of our collegiate ministry
3985218 we have to be willing to do the work and take responsibility
3985219 its good just to realize we do know a lot about how to minister to college students
3985220 its also a great time to be around all these other leaders who deal with the same issues and hear what they do
3985221 god called thousands of preachers but only a few collegiate ministers
3985222 1 1 million homeschool students in the united sates in 2003
3985223 if not the court at least god was on our side
3985224 its not a rule change what is there to be voted on in his role as chief executive the commissioner has the power of negotiating with the unions for the players and umpires to get it done theres no opposition to it from the owners at least i havent heard of any
3985225 it is on the thursday agenda and we continue to work on it and continue to discuss it
3985226 you have to try and protect him and his confidence and try to put him in a better possible situation to succeed
3985227 dickerson will be back in there tomorrow against ian snell
3985228 all your nerves go stupid when i tried to step on it it was a step on a non existent leg
3985229 oh its okay sometimes we have a bad show now and then
3985230 some commentators have suggested the government establish an aussie mac as a mechanism to inject liquidity into the market and provide a price discovery function in times of severe market stress treasury executive director markets group jim murphy told a a federal parliamentary committee hearing in sydney
3985231 it appears that for some the aussie mac proposal is seen as a mechanism to address the current problems in securitisation markets
3985232 treasury strongly disagrees with this in that the treasurer has ruled out establishing a government body of this nature
3985233 we think its important to note that underlying australias rmbs markets are high quality assets and it is expected that once some normality returns to the market this will assist in accumulating demand for rmbs and restoring this funding channel
3985234 one can only speculate why superannuation funds are not involved in this but they make their own decisions
3985235 we have recently seen a decrease in the bank bill rate of approximately 40 basis points resulting in a fall of the cost of raising new funds he said
3985236 we saw the banks increase their interest rates when funding costs went up
3985237 on the same token we expect lenders to pass on any reduction in funding costs to their customers in a timely way
3985238 having a central account number system would be a costly exercise and which every way you look at it someone will have to pay for it he said
3985239 if the senate does conduct an additional review it is essential its terms of reference are broad ranging to achieve real outcomes for indigenous australians
3985240 we have to take the politics out of this debate
3985241 in order to achieve a lasting impact a review by the senate would need to consider historical funding arrangements for indigenous services since 1978
3985242 it would need to assess the backlog in health education housing and infrastructure and determine whether commonwealth funding support is adequate
3985243 if the senate does conduct an additional review it is essential its terms of reference are broad ranging to achieve real outcomes for indigenous australians
3985244 our peaceful action highlighted the rudd and bligh governments plans to rapidly expand coal exports when the world is trying to cut global emissions
3985245 it is contradictory and immoral for our political leaders to be expanding australias export coal industry whilst talking about urgent action on climate change
3985246 if your integrated video chipset doesnt support dhcp or doesnt accelerate decoding its not going to play blu ray movies
3985247 obviously mtrons flash ssd still is quicker when it comes to starting windows xp
3985248 because power consumption increases as the square of clock speed in addition voltage boosts further reduce energy efficiency
3985249 any energy efficient processor such as an intel core 2 duo e8000 will no longer be efficient at all once overclocked because power consumption increases as the square of clock speed in addition voltage boosts further reduce energy efficiency
3985250 make sure you find a motherboard that is either based on a small number of voltage regulator phases in order to save power one that dynamically switches phases on and off as required
3985251 the core 2 duo e8000 series which is based on intels 45 nm manufacturing process is the most energy efficient dual core processor available today and is the most powerful dual core model as well we recommend going for any version as the performance differences among them are small if you stay below 3 ghz the power consumption will also be low even under load all e8000 core 2 duo processors have a total of 6 mb shared l2 cache and they will run in all current socket 775 motherboards its usually possible to exchange an intel dual core for a quad core processor should you need more performance
3985252 the time it takes for photoshop cs3 to load up is comparable on both machines even if the windows version is faster
3985253 the launching and initialization of microsoft word 2008 on mac 2007 on windows was interesting to compare since the windows version launched almost immediately while the mac version was very slow
3985254 the two systems with the different operating systems are not directly comparable
3985255 the lenovo doesnt have firewire which is a downside compared to the macbook however conversely the lenovo runs a solid state hdd
3985256 our love of the lenovo with some benchmarks to compare to apple to get attention of apple fans stirred up
3985257 the appropriate role for the federal government is to move as quickly as it can to put in place the new industrial legislation and to urge all parties including telstra to live in the real world to recognise the fact that circumstances have changed and to act in good faith he said
3985258 telstra has not acted in an honest way they have sought to camouflage their intentions here
3985259 we want work choices to be got rid of as soon as possible mr lawrence said
3985260 but we also understand that the federal government has a complex task in dismantling work choices in putting in place a whole new industrial system it is a difficult task
3985261 where is the balance here where is the fairness he said
3985262 all we are asking is telstra to be open with us and its employees and put its cards on the table
3985263 of course we looked at the companys options if union negotiations broke down and they did mr barr said
3985264 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3985265 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or work choices and our employees would get to vote on it
3985266 it will be entirely consistent with labor party policy and the law mr barr said
3985267 since ageia has joined futuremarks paid participation program this test is optimized for the physx ppu found in gaming pcs which absolutely does not reflect the current situation nor is it likely to change unless some big surprises are in store
3985268 spending more than 350 will provide very little extra in the way of performance two 8800 gts will outperform the 9800 gtx or 9800 gx2 in the great majority of situations
3985269 the new charts section is a disaster slow and unuseable
3985270 maybe they were preoccupied with other life issues or selfish or stupid or stubborn
3985271 if your normal happy go lucky 12 year old child cant walk unaided for a period of weeks screams in pain cant shower wet and soils herself in her clothes if no one helps her to the toilet cries in the night and cant walk the next day you shouldnt need any medical training to have worked out that she is a very very sick young girl
3985272 the standard of care was not breached in this case
3985273 all of the foundation of the crown case is simply false i am asking you ladies and gentleman to put an end to all of this just end it for gods sake and allow her ms reynolds to grieve
3985274 if it is your view that facs should have done more well perhaps they should have
3985275 perhaps they should have done a lot more before this day
3985276 maybe they were preoccupied with other life issues or selfish or stupid or stubborn
3985277 what ever barack wants is fine and dandy with me im just grateful this country still lets women vote we still can vote right
3985278 he has not shown that the u s has either as a matter of deliberate policy or official indiffernce required or allowed its combatants to engage in widespread actions in violation of humanitarian law
3985279 no matter how much i wanted to i could not convince myself that killing someone was right
3985280 i have already missed a large chunk of my young sons life and i was willing to sacrifice any more lost time with him especially during his formative years
3985281 because it is an act of aggression with no defensive basis it has been supported by pretenses that cannot withstand even elementary scrutiny first before the u s dropped the first bomb it was quite evident that iraq had no weapons of mass destruction second the bush administration had the gall to exploit the american publics fear of terrorists by making the absurd assertion that a secular batthist government was working with a fundamentalist terrorist group there was nevery any intelligence to substantiate this third the notion that the u s wants to export democracy to iraq is laughable democracy is by the people not an appointed puppet theater
3985282 a u s soldier who deserted his iraq bound regiment and sought asylum in canada said the u s war in iraq was illegal and he accused the united states of committing war crimes pfc jeremy hinzman 25 is believed to be the first u s soldier to apply for refugee status in canada after refusing combat duty in iraq
3985283 i was told in basic training that if im given an illegal or immoral order it is my duty to disobey it
3985284 whether a country lives under freedom or tyranny or whatever else thats the collective responsibility of the people of that country
3985285 this is a very disappointing decision it puts canada more fully in complicity with an illegal and immoral war jeremy will probably end up back here at fort bragg thats usually what happens
3985286 i applied for conscientious objector status in the u s army because i realized that i cannot kill a fellow humna being but my application was denied i knew that in iraq i would be ordered to take part in combat operations or other actions that are against my principles
3985287 nga and i knew canada had welcomed many americans like us during the vietnam war and we knew canada had refused to join the invasion of iraq
3985288 sending jeremy and his family back to the u s where he would face harsh punishment would be cruel
3985289 it would fly in the face of the motion adopted by the house of commons on june 3 which called on the harper government to stop all deportation proceedings against these conscientious objectors
3985290 jeremy hinzman 29 had filed for a pre removal risk assessment and permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds with citizenship and immigration canada in january after several prior failed attempts to gain refugee status today he was told that both of those applications had been rejected and he must leave the country by sept 23
3985291 obviously were disappointed but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we end up
3985292 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed

3985301 you are going to college in the midst of a psychedelic renaissance
3985302 you are going to college in the midst of a cultural renaissance
3985303 for me individually i was very much in my head
3985304 the antidote to hitler is the study of the deep psyche
3985305 rick is one of the most motivated students i ever had
3985306 and his lifes goal very clearly is to get psychedelics approved for therapeutic medication
3985307 he has a good feel for dealing with people he was more militant when he was younger
3985308 now he knows how government works and his organizational skills are better and he knows how to make friends with his opponents
3985309 the idea of going to the fda and getting psychedelic drugs approved was never seriously pursued by the drug reform movement
3985310 i cant take the visions he proposes and walk over to a congressional office with them
3985311 rick stands alone with his childrens access positions theres almost no real support for that anywhere
3985312 the hysteria about kids and drugs is what drives the drug war today
3985313 in the 1960s it was all about a cultural rebellion but today its all about fear
3985314 its amazing to me the number of people who smoke marijuana and hide it from their kids because its illegal education is the real key its essential this should be a decision of the parents not the government prohibition denies parents the opportunity to have an honest conversation with their kids about making responsible choices
3985315 decreased fear and anxiety increased openness trust and interpersonal closeness
3985316 these people become very sleepy theyre almost not present and it doesnt completely eliminate the pain
3985317 but the combination of mdma and opiates brings people back to alertness and then opens up their access to their emotions and reduces pain
3985318 but will it present a clinical value that significantly exceeds what we already have out there i dont think mdma is unique or that it will produce a magic bullet
3985319 ten million dollars aint gonna do it hell need hundreds of millions of dollars even if hes allowed to keep going
3985320 i think people are ready for a new conversation about the therapeutic value of psychedelics
3985321 to go from here to there really requires a politically powerful medical professional and the mass media to get on top of it and stay on top of it

3985345 they are going to be making a lot of money and the person whos buying the diesel is getting it at a discounted rate
3985346 its obviously not fair honest people might be getting ripped off that way too as an indirect result of diesel thefts
3985347 omdat ik het grotendeels zelf wilde doen en omdat het niet zo gemakkelijk is om aan onderdelen te geraken
3985348 maar wees gerust ik ben een overgelukkige trainer het middenveld begon angstig maar ons tweede en derde kwartier waren uitmuntend we ontwikkelden kansen alleen de kers op de taart ontbrak ook na die onverwachte achterstand geloofde ik in een goede afloop met elf tegen elf zijn we schitterend blijven voetballen tegen negen zijn we nonchalanter geworden maar uiteindelijk hebben we toen toch de 1 3 geforceerd de rode kaarten eerlijk ik heb het niet gezien
3985349 die jongen heeft vertrouwen nodig dat zie je met een sidibe in vorm kunnen wij ver komen maar het zijn nog 35 cupmatchen vergeet dat niet
3985350 wat me tevreden stemt is de team spirit die ik gezien heb heb je gezien hoe onze goals gevierd werden je ziet dat een paar jongens van vorig seizoen snakten naar een start met een zege de anciens van stvv vertoefden al jaren in een negatieve spiraal we moeten proberen alleen nog positief te denken
3985351 vorig seizoen kwam ik hier toe als een wrak doodmoe gereisd met de nationale ploeg van hier naar daar door transferbeslommeringen en uiteindelijk met veel druk op de ketel mo ten presteren dit keer sta ik zowel mentaal als fysiek veel sterker op het terrein plus met een type als chara in mijn rug voel ik me uitstekend in mijn vel

3985358 cabinet will look at what further measures will be possible to reduce the pressure on a system
3985359 there is much much more to be done and we are working hard on this
3985360 the core reason for the pressure on the system being we are in the middle of an appallingly low level of rainfall and i cant make it rain
3985361 you cant turn the queen mary around to be sailing in a particular direction for the last 12 years in six months
3985362 first off before i point any fingers i personally do want to apologize for the incident that happened at the ozone awards i hope you all dont get the wrong impression of me or my city the incident that i was put in was totally unexpected and totally unprofessional if i knew this was going to happen at a big event such as the ozone awards first i would not have brought my mother and second i would have done everything in my power to prevent it knowing that this event was big not only for me and other artist but for the city as a whole i pray and hope that you the people can see and understand me and the unfortunate situation i was put in i am aware of how big this event was for the city of houston and the entire hip hop community please know that i had no intention of tarnishing this great opportunity nor the experiences of those who participated in it i apologize once again for everything that happened but i cannot apologize for having to defend myself from someone bringing unexpected or un called violence to me and my family at any time i apologize once again and i appreciate your support and understanding
3985363 its difficult to imagine a circumstance where the government could directly control interest rates without a whole range of adverse consequences occurring a whole range of other things mr tanner told abc radio
3985364 weve seen it in the past for example where we had a cap on interest rates
3985365 what that meant was that people ended up with cocktail loans for their homes where they borrowed a proportion of their mortgage at the official interest rate and had to borrow the rest at a really high interest rate much much higher than the official rate
3985366 now i wouldnt speculate about what they might be and of course its not my direct responsibility mr tanner said
3985367 well cross that bridge if and when we come to it if we believe that the banks are not doing the right thing then clearly we will be examining the options to put greater pressure on
3985368 rolled gold guarantees on rates because theyve got other factors that they have to worry about as well
3985369 they will have a very heavy onus to both the government and the community to explain that
3985370 crude has regained some of its losses over the past few trading sessions reacting to the inventory report which showed very substantial stock draws in gasoline said victor shum an analyst with energy consultancy purvin and gertz in singapore
3985371 concerns about the us economy and now the spread of the economic slowdown to europe and asia could push crude oil pricing to test lower lows because some of the supply issues have been discounted by the market mr shum said
3985372 the supply issues should really become relevant again at some point and this is likely to backstop the drop in oil pricing he said
3985373 these issues have not disappeared they have simply been discounted
3985374 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
3985375 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3985376 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
3985377 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
3985378 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3985379 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
3985380 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3985381 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3985382 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know

3985386 to find a department with seven faculty members in my area about 20 graduate students and some undergrads is fantastic we really have a good working relationship within this group
3985387 the amount of support for research and teaching from the department college and university was a big draw also having the ability to work with the caliber of students in our department made illinois win out over some other places
3985388 one of my interests at this point is trying to go to larger networks of instrumentation than the historical paradigm has been
3985389 were trying to make observations of a global system a system that is from the sun to the earth and everything in between we really need to have larger networks so we will be able to see not only what the temporal variability is at a single site but also what the spatial variability and correlations are so that we can better predict and forecast the state of the system as a whole
3985390 the us stands with the democratically elected government of georgia insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3985391 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country

3985400 it was confronted with a half baked project for which no funding had been set aside
3985401 very difficult to go through a proper planning process which was something the project really needed
3985402 i find it extraordinary that anyone would think given our limited physical space in the museum that there would not be competition over which aspects of australian environmental and human history we should choose to focus on
3985403 there was too much of a tendency towards playfulness which was taken by many as trivialising australian history
3985404 museums have to entertain but also to educate engage challenge and awe
3985405 when the museum was first planned it was at the height of the fashion to see museums as competing in the entertainment business
3985406 things are not at crisis point and i would not wish to be thought of as saying so
3985407 sometimes it just gets a little frustrating to know that for the price of only a small item of defence material we could take an equally important step towards protecting australias heritage
3985408 the national museum was a platform policy of john howards government
3985409 there was a substantial review on where the museum was going to be sited and there was a very thorough process around the selection of the architect
3985410 ive been farming for 33 years and this was probably one of the hardest springs ive had putting a crop in

3985412 what worries me is how many other times he has done it and i ask myself whether he has done anything even worse
3985413 i wont come into manchester any more unless i have to ive moved away from the area
3985414 its changed a lot you want to talk to people because you are scared its such a difficult area its embarrassing but it shouldnt be
3985415 im angry very angry with him hes obviously shown no remorse for what hes done hes not got a care for anyone i wouldnt be surprised if it got worse
3985416 be extremely cautious look over your shoulder if you are unfortunate and he does something to you get a good look at him if you can because the more people who positively identify him the more chance of getting him
3985417 people who know anything about this if they have any moral decency or standards should come forward if they can hes turned peoples lives upside down for his own sick enjoyment
3985418 i didnt notice anyone behind me i was speaking to a friend on my mobile at the time
3985419 i was walking down the road and someone grabbed me it happened quite fast i turned round to shout at him thats when i got a good view of him
3985420 people have asked why i didnt run but i was so shocked
3985421 these are very serious sexual assaults the victims have been very badly affected
3985422 three women have been attacked more than once typically he follows his victims and then lies in wait this man poses a serious risk we need help from the public
3985423 people should not worry about naming the wrong man because we have forensic evidence which can be used to rule out anybody else
3985424 people are saying a record pass rate is a terrible thing
3985425 while some elements of courses are easier because students can retake modules students still have to do a lot of course work and perform well at exams in order to even pass their subject
3985426 i feel so sorry for our students because they want to celebrate what theyve done but theyre being told its worthless
3985427 it is a very positive picture and an accurate reflection of all the hard work that has taken place over the last year
3985428 we are very happy with the way things have gone the grades are going up every year but from what we have seen it because of our students hard work

3985432 he didnt set out to commit these offences he didnt intend to take items from royal mail with the intention of putting them on ebay the fact he had so many packages supports the contention that it was getting out of control

3985440 the warlords of japan have surrendered unconditionally this is the end of the schemes of dictators to enslave the peoples of the world destroy their civilization and institute a new era of darkness and degradation
3985441 our global victory has come from the courage of free men and women united in determination to fight it has come from the massive strength of arms created by peace loving peoples who knew that unless they won decency in the world would end it has come from millions of peaceful citizens turned soldiers overnight who showed a ruthless enemy that they were not afraid to fight
3985442 it has come with the help of god who was with us in the early days of adversity and who has now brought us to this glorious day of triumph let us give thanks to him and dedicated ourselves to follow in his ways

3985471 there is now far too much on the table particularly for developing countries to give up on these negotiations

3985480 it is clear from cctv footage that the accused has extended his leg behind his body and kicked the victim in the face with considerable force
3985481 when asked what condition the victim was in at the time the accused stated that the victim was in a very bad way he was not moving was not making a sound and he was bleeding from the noise
3985482 the accused was unsure if the victim was even alive at all
3985483 we havent got a specific weapon but it may have been an armchair or a lounge chair theres was a lounge chair with blood on it

3985498 confusion is a word we have invented for an order which is not understood
3985499 reminds me of the way five to seven year olds play soccer players on both teams tend to chase the ball in the manner of a noisy herd they are in effect totally data dependent their approach stands in sharp contrast to the behavior of older kids anchored by a better understanding of the game and more of a strategic mindset the older players seek to maintain positions on the field and rely more on letting the ball do the work

3985516 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
3985517 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
3985518 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
3985519 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
3985520 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
3985521 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
3985522 if this is the life why does it feel so good to die today blue to grey grow up and blow away
3985523 his observations on the domestic sphere teeter amiably on the edge but when he wants to riden can still zing pop culture the media and american life in general with incisive wit
3985524 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3985525 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3985526 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and has agreed to a provisional cease fire
3985527 unfortunately weve been receiving reports of russia n actions that are inconsistent with these statements

3985542 but 20 years thats not a long time in the universe in a cosmic sense
3985543 its taken a long long time but i always knew it would
3985544 lets cut to the chase and say yeah of course i do id be stupid not to cities should have vibrant cultures
3985545 i just think theres a requirement for this country to have a medium size orchestra that travels around unencumbered by financial concerns

3985549 quite a few years ago i thought id got there when there were quite a few personality bumps
3985550 there were a number of different factors and im glad i didnt jump ship then i was almost going to but of course ive got a shelf life i might run out of good ideas i might not be able to work with my colleagues things can change really quickly but what keeps me here artistically is the ability we have to control our own destiny
3985551 i dont think of myself as a commentator i see myself not as a politician occasionally as an activist but its easy to come across as the whingeing artist and i always tire of that in the media
3985552 any country with intelligent students all the scandinavian ones you can see that theyre more than likely to have free quality music education
3985553 its still early im sure the big visionary statement is just around the corner
3985554 i just cant see how anything positive came out of all of that
3985555 i thought ah ha thats what we need in australia
3985556 it could be sydney one year melbourne the next maybe wollongong albury broome all eyes would be on those cultural capitals its then up to them thered be a pool of money and they have to raise the capital from private and public sources and build infrastructure theyve got to build theyve got to plan and theyve got to concentrate on cultural activities

3985563 la actitud del equipo no es la misma que mostramos en el torneo clausura dejamos de correr lo cual hace que nos lleguen mucho al arco y el equipo debe meter m s actitud porque no toda la culpa la tenemos nosotros los defensas cuando no hay actitud el equipo se ve mal en ese sentido
3985564 cuando recibes siete goles en dos partidos quiere decir que obviamente se est haciendo algo mal vamos a buscar corregir eso pero malas rachas todos los quipos las tienen por lo pronto vamos a buscar este s bado ante san luis conservar el cero para de ah partir porque de que hacemos goles hacemos goles
3985565 lo que siempre debemos dejar en la cancha es la entrega ojal que as sea en los juegos restantes del torneo antes que nada debe haber mucha actitud de todos somos un equipo aqu nadie se salva todos ganamos y todos perdemos no es tarde para corregir el camino vamos en la jornada tres no hay que llorar estamos a tiempo

3985574 a number of teams have been targeted and our team is one of the better teams
3985575 naturally we are in for more testing than what normally happens at most olympic games
3985576 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here they have tested me four times and took blood a lot of blood
3985577 im saying that they are taking so much blood we are going to be very weak before the final of the 100m
3985578 it will have absolutely no effect on the physical well being in regards to blood volume
3985579 if you are taking a blood test you can lose blood by the amount of blood that they use the amount of blood that they take for this test is of absolutely no significance in the overall blood volume of the athlete
3985580 it makes you feel targeted you begin to feel fed up and frustrated

3985591 they have a lot of experience and have absolute clarity in their mind on what they want to do they are very spontaneous and we even get together very well in that way
3985592 the character in the film is just like me radhika works and keeps her relationship going simultaneously the role is very contemporary she is an effortless dresser she wears shorts and vests and uses all kinds of funky bags and accessories

3985601 there wasnt anything that occurred that she could be suing over
3985602 just a power of the wills it was very authoritative on both parts
3985603 you had a duty as the captain of this plane to call the police and you didnt do it
3985604 what ever barack wants is fine and dandy with me im just grateful this country still lets women vote we still can vote right
3985605 he has not shown that the u s has either as a matter of deliberate policy or official indiffernce required or allowed its combatants to engage in widespread actions in violation of humanitarian law
3985606 no matter how much i wanted to i could not convince myself that killing someone was right
3985607 i have already missed a large chunk of my young sons life and i was willing to sacrifice any more lost time with him especially during his formative years
3985608 because it is an act of aggression with no defensive basis it has been supported by pretenses that cannot withstand even elementary scrutiny first before the u s dropped the first bomb it was quite evident that iraq had no weapons of mass destruction second the bush administration had the gall to exploit the american publics fear of terrorists by making the absurd assertion that a secular batthist government was working with a fundamentalist terrorist group there was nevery any intelligence to substantiate this third the notion that the u s wants to export democracy to iraq is laughable democracy is by the people not an appointed puppet theater
3985609 a u s soldier who deserted his iraq bound regiment and sought asylum in canada said the u s war in iraq was illegal and he accused the united states of committing war crimes pfc jeremy hinzman 25 is believed to be the first u s soldier to apply for refugee status in canada after refusing combat duty in iraq
3985610 i was told in basic training that if im given an illegal or immoral order it is my duty to disobey it
3985611 whether a country lives under freedom or tyranny or whatever else thats the collective responsibility of the people of that country
3985612 this is a very disappointing decision it puts canada more fully in complicity with an illegal and immoral war jeremy will probably end up back here at fort bragg thats usually what happens
3985613 i applied for conscientious objector status in the u s army because i realized that i cannot kill a fellow humna being but my application was denied i knew that in iraq i would be ordered to take part in combat operations or other actions that are against my principles
3985614 nga and i knew canada had welcomed many americans like us during the vietnam war and we knew canada had refused to join the invasion of iraq
3985615 sending jeremy and his family back to the u s where he would face harsh punishment would be cruel
3985616 it would fly in the face of the motion adopted by the house of commons on june 3 which called on the harper government to stop all deportation proceedings against these conscientious objectors
3985617 jeremy hinzman 29 had filed for a pre removal risk assessment and permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds with citizenship and immigration canada in january after several prior failed attempts to gain refugee status today he was told that both of those applications had been rejected and he must leave the country by sept 23
3985618 obviously were disappointed but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we end up
3985619 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed
3985620 robidoux said hinzman who lives in toronto with his wife and two children plans to take a close look at the decisions before deciding how to proceed
3985621 federal ndp citizenship and immigration critic olivia chow who put foward the june 3rd parliament motion called the decision to expell jeremy mean spirited she called on citizenship and immigration minister diane finley to hald the deporation of hinzman and other resisters immediately
3985622 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd

3985640 being rich and living the life of an aristocrat are not the same thing
3985641 maybe one day i will buy a villa costing millions of yuan but not now
3985642 more and more people are curious about the lifestyles of the rich in china we want to give them an insight
3985643 i do not know where i can spend so much money maybe one day i will buy a villa costing millions of yuan but not now

3985646 durch unsere weltweite pr senz sind wir schon heute in der lage konjunkturelle schwankungen in einzelnen m rkten auszugleichen
3985647 chancen ergeben sich f r uns nicht zuletzt aus der weltweiten verknappung der rohstoffe und der daraus resultierenden energieprobleme genau darauf haben wir das segment resources ausgerichtet mit neuen tiefbohrger ten und spezialkenntnissen bei bauleistungen f r tiefe bergwerke helfen wir rohstoffvorkommen zu erschlie en dar ber hinaus werden wir vom investitionsstau bei infrastrukturprojekten wie dem bau von kraftwerken profitieren
3985648 our worldwide presence means we are already able to compensate for fluctuating business cycles in individual markets
3985649 the growing worldwide shortage of raw materials and the resulting energy problems are actually a big opportunity for us that is precisely the target area of our resources segment we can help to exploit reserves of raw materials thanks to our new deep level drilling rigs and specialized knowledge in operations for deep mines and we can profit from the investment backlog for infrastructure projects such as the construction of power stations
3985650 my film has grossed rs 460 480 million over the first weekend thats more than om shanti om and welcome which had the highest opening so far so obviously the film has been liked i cant please every single sikh
3985651 who are these agitators this is nothing but a shortcut to fame the boys of the sikh youth federation mustve thought that when delhis gurdwara committee protested akshay rushed to delhi in amritsar they mustve thought this is their way of getting akshay into amritsar
3985652 all the important and powerful bodies of the sikh community cleared the film what were these boys on friday protesting about they said they hadnt even seen the film they just said it was an insult to sikhism but in what way
3985653 they feel somehow their culture will be threatened when films like jodhaa akbar and singh is kinng pay homage to the people and culture of a community
3985654 they were doing bhangra with dhols after the screening they told a news channel that this was the first film in 70 years of indian cinema that had done justice to the sikh community what more endorsement for our motives can there be
3985655 the final authority on right and wrong in a film should be the censor board once the board approves all protests should be crushed with iron hands otherwise all of us should just fold up our production houses im not disrespecting sikh sentiments so please stop hounding me for nothing
3985656 we admit akshays beard shouldve been longer we added a scene where akshay says he made a mistake by trimming his beard and in the video with snoop dogg during the end titles he comes with a full beard albeit a false one
3985657 itd have taken akshay two years to grow a natural beard we had told the shiromani gurdwara prabandhak committee sgpc that the beard would be false and they had agreed
3985658 i gave my director anees bazmi the freedom to do what he likes i only wanted him to tell a morally correct story i didnt want to flinch while watching it with my sons

3985661 no one really did anything wrong i just wish i could have gotten that pitch to vernon down a little more
3985662 this is dangerous because were doing just enough to lose right now
3985663 thats not good we have to start doing the things that it takes to win
3985664 i didnt throw enough strikes early but i started to relax about the fourth inning thats when i started making the pitches i wanted
3985665 you get a walk an aggravating bunt and then a double play grounder that takes a bad hop
3985666 kenny did very well tonight but weve been getting bad hops lately
3985667 he just has to work on getting first pitch strikes and getting ahead of hitters
3985668 i didnt want to go out there and see a bone sticking out of his leg
3985669 hell be reassessed in a couple days but if he cant pitch it will be a big loss for the team
3985670 i dont pay attention to it ive been on waivers plenty of times
3985671 lots of great players are put on waivers but it is only a story when it is someone like manny ramirez or me someone that people have an opinion about
3985672 returning from munich 70 years ago in 1938 british prime minister neville chamberlain said about czechoslovakia which had just been dismembered its a small far away place about which we know nothing
3985673 those countries who value freedom and democracy must stand up for it whenever it is threatened
3985674 we cant allow a second munich when the international community climbed down to hitler
3985675 if military aggression is being justified by the need to protect russian citizens then this should cause concern for all countries with russian nationals living within their borders
3985676 no state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state
3985677 the powers that be at powerschool are trying to get us back up and running by tomorrow morning but we rely heavily on computers
3985678 i want to get into a teachers class that i like more
3985679 they usually fix things pretty quickly theyll just get to play for a day and go to their real classes the next day
3985680 were running all eight classes tomorrow and kids just come through and spend a few minutes with their teachers getting to know their teachers and find out what the courses are all about so you know well live with it and run as smoothly as we can
3985681 ich hatte die hoffnung dass ich dabei bin aber jetzt bin ich gl cklich dass es auch so gekommen ist
3985682 hey theres somebody in the driveway its a truck mom mom the computers here
3985683 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3985684 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3985685 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3985686 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3985687 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3985688 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3985689 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3985690 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3985691 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3985692 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3985693 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3985694 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3985695 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3985696 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3985697 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3985698 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3985699 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3985700 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3985701 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3985702 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3985703 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3985704 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3985705 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3985706 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3985707 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3985708 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3985709 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3985710 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3985711 were asking for the publics help because as well as the cost to business its the public who are affected by disruptions to services when people steal copper in this manner
3985712 there are arrangements through the organisation austrac to follow money trails once you know what the money is being used for
3985713 i had a nice time but i really dont think im ready for a commitment
3985714 did anyone ever tell you that your eyes are the color of a vintage marzemino
3985715 and in closing the witness could not have seen my client on the scene carrying a bottle of refosco white wine because refosco is a red wine he was actually carrying a bottle of auxerrois
3985716 and i say im the leader of this gang whaddya got to say about that shiv
3985717 shivs our new leader shiv shiv shiv shiv shiv shiv
3985718 i hate to do this tom but the economys terrible and we just cant afford to keep so many people on staff right now
3985719 thats ok i guess ill go drown my sorrows with a bottle of sagrantino
3985720 sagrantino did you say forgot all that layoff talk take my job instead you deserve it more than i do

3985723 when facebook ceo mark zuckerberg wants to illustrate the impact of his social network he tells a story about several young religious militants from lebanon who changed their view of western culture through facebook friendships the subtext to the tale is that free expression of ideas enabled by the web bridges deep cultural divides but we knew that its one of the central concepts behind the olympics after all what we didnt know is that facebook is in lebanon

3985766 before the downpour let me just say that my new movie my best friends girl is the best funniest film ive done yet
3985767 that being said let me address the fact that although im not a marketing major i have a bit of a trusted reputation after 18 years self promoting id like to inform you i had no say in this marketing campaign but if i did things would be different since it is obvious that this poster is boring odd and has zero to do with the movie i performed in

3985804 why dont we have the debate regarding the land scam here in penang
3985805 the camera performs well in a variety of situations with fairly good overall responsiveness and timing producing good quality images with good exposure and overall color
3985806 image quality is good with excellent colour with high levels of saturation contrast and detail noise is higher than average compared to the competition but is low up to iso400 and detail is good there was also some red eye in group photos but overall red eye was generally quite low the camera did a good job focusing even in low light
3985807 camera performance is very good the powershot a590 is ready to shoot after a 1 2 second delay pretty snappy focus speeds were very good even in low light situations shutter lag wasnt a problem and shot to shot delays were minimal except when youre using the flash which is slow to charge
3985808 image quality from this 8 megapixel consumer model was excellent
3985809 canon leads the field in image quality because it relies on intelligent solutions not quick fixes
3985810 every camera released today incorporates class leading features to combat common problems like camera shake and subject blur without sacrificing overall image quality
3985811 the good excellent photo quality fast performance solid dust and splash proof body flip and twist lcd large 100 percent coverage viewfinder built in wireless flash controller the bad relatively low resolution for the price smallish lcd some clunky design aspects
3985812 all things considered the olympus e 3 is a solid midrange digital slr in more ways than one it does almost everything well with just a few weaknesses most of which have easy workarounds if youre an enthusiast looking for a powerful d slr that doesnt mind if it gets a little bit wet then i can highly recommend taking a look at the e 3
3985813 low iso image quality is superlative my best iso 100 to 400 jpegs are clean silky smooth and finely detailed resolution is outstanding color saturation contrast and sharpness are quite high for a very pleasing overall effect
3985814 i cannot really express how impressed i am with this lens close up ability this is simply stunning for a kit lens albeit an expensive one close focus ability is best of any of the zd zoom lenses ive tested so far and the resolution it delivers is on a par with the zd35mm macro
3985815 the e3 has strengths in the areas of auto focus implementation of live view dust reduction internal image stabilization lens line up and environmental sealing it produces great accurate jpegs right out of camera with even better quality possible in raw mode all in all when you weigh the positives and the negatives the e3 is a very strong candidate in the enthusiast pro category
3985816 the olympus e 3 is certainly worthy of its acclaimed professional status in the right hands the camera has huge potential for the pro as well as the advanced enthusiast and getting to know its many options should keep you occupied during most of the christmas holidays
3985817 photographing with the olympus e 3 is a bit like driving a sports sedan you may not need the speed and power most of the time but youre sure glad its there when you do plus you get comfort and style with your scoot the e 3 is more than competent for everyday shooting and its speed and burst depth handle demanding moments with ease
3985818 pictures were crisp and sharp as youd expect from a high end slr we made several large prints of our shots and they turned out beautifully we still give the edge to the eos 40d in some situations as we did encounter some minor softness and loss of detail at large magnifications but for the most part the images impressed
3985819 the olympus e 1 may be looked upon as a semi pro dslr camera but got surpassed from all sides in the last few years the one thing that remained through the years is its reliability and its solidness features that are of indescribable value to a photographer
3985820 iso performance highest iso is acceptable and mid iso appears absolutely fine to me i was especially pleased to see iso 800 results were well within my acceptance criteria and ive nothing to be worried about i simply wish to be able to crank it up to iso 800 without reaping any undue consequences
3985821 the olympus e 3 is by far the most advanced olympus digital camera ive used very satisfying to shoot with and one of the more compelling slrs launched this season its design though big is ergonomically pleasing and handsome and it gives you a feel of confidence and control
3985822 olympus claims that the e 3 has the fastest autofocus among dslrs while we cannot immediately verify this we certainly did find the focusing extremely speedy compared to cameras we have used
3985823 this means sharper shots every time no matter which lens is used
3985824 theres very little news thats of any interest whatsoever to anyone outside australia
3985825 except were in total denial about that we think were much more important on the world stage than we are
3985826 i dont know its partly thanks to howard sucking dubyas dick for all those long years by the end of it he wasnt the only one in australia who believed we were best buds with the states reflected glory and all that but personally i got the picture when i was travelling through europe at the beginning of 1999 the australian dollar didnt appear on a single exchange board and i thought whoah we just dont register at all
3985827 i guess its also because were like a fully operational multinational multicultural first world democracy i think australians quite reasonably look around and think well this is it isnt it this is the model the rest of the world is trying to find if its not this then what is it were like exhibit a of a functional democracy so i think that affects our thinking about ourselves too in many ways australia works its a western success story so perhaps that inflates our sense of self importance too
3985828 its a very exciting time for us at the club to have the first queensland roar national youth league team assembled
3985829 if there was no national youth league these players would not play at all over the summer
3985830 now the national youth league gives them an opportunity to continue to play during the summer and at a step above where theyve been playing so far
3985831 if we can perform well and build on that performance that would be very very good
3985832 they help you as youre training so you can only get better
3985833 its one of the main reasons why i signed a contract not just frank but radio is a good coach as well
3985834 i think he still can contribute a lot to the national team
3985835 he is not so young but he is enjoying a good run at his club so i think he can give a lot of things to this group
3985836 the most important goal is to make it into the world cup a first goal is to play good football but our main goal is the world cup

3985843 this is a grave challenge to the united states and europe
3985844 the united states and its nato allies must together impose a price on russia
3985845 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america

3985849 hes a good player so im very happy with this win because i think this was the first true test in this tournament
3985850 if hes too good for me hes too good for me
3985851 every time at the beginning of each match ive felt like i could come out on top
3985852 but i was just making so many errors and i wasnt practicing like that at all it came to a point i think i hit a backhand in the net and i had just had enough
3985853 its only every four years so now is the time to really play well
3985854 its looking great for the americans the past couple of days
3985855 it would be great if we could finish up strong here and walk away with a few medals
3985856 i dont understand why we dont play such a big tournament over 10 days maybe i think this is asking just a little bit too much
3985857 i got it out of my system i guess the first time i beat him

3985860 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3985861 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3985862 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3985863 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3985864 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3985865 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3985866 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3985867 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3985868 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3985869 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3985870 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3985871 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3985872 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3985873 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3985885 we may have some needs to do some restructuring but not a massive restructuring again its more of a kind of one off situation

3985887 3m is targeting administrative costs to remain flat going forward while the full benefits of the 19 new plants and plant expansions will not be realized until 2010
3985888 this is offsetting flat results in the u s and western europe
3985889 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3985890 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
3985891 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3985892 put it in the cash flow and had high expectations
3985893 i was convinced at first that i was going to rent this place out
3985894 so far extra business has been a lot of wild speculation
3985895 we do not influence the list in any way we simply provide a list of names and then its up to them
3985896 we are pleased with the number of events scheduled at ordway center and thrilled to have so many people from outside the twin cities have the opportunity to experience what our facility has to offer
3985897 surprisingly i think the bookings are coming in much much later than everyone anticipated
3985898 no one wants to violate any laws or the spirit of any laws and its taking awhile to figure everything out
3985899 is it as great as everyones expectations i guess were going to have to wait and see
3985900 we need to be more attuned to other symptoms that somebody may be presenting
3985901 i have no credentials for others to listen to me just my own voice which wants to be heard i am a person too just like the millionaires
3985902 i felt like i let my family down i felt horrible as a mother as a wife that is in charge of the money
3985903 i look at my situation and oh my gosh i think about that other person in my similar situation who doesnt have an in law or other support
3985904 money has divided us as a country politics are there but they are just a distraction to it she wrote this week in her notebook she reads this as kadee shows me an impressive drawing of a cat she made for me
3985905 yet this is where we are as a country not believing the good in one another we need to come together to stop being divided
3985906 baik banget artalyta meminjamkan duit sebanyak itu tidak ada perjanjiannya
3985907 god i wish there was like a one stop shop where i could go and learn everything about that person
3985908 there were some variations using the word fire but none with bird
3985909 since they had a national contest to name the truck i thought theyd come up with something really catchy
3985910 but to some extent id have to say there doesnt seem to be too much originality behind the name
3985911 its a little surprising since bloggers at the new york auto show handed out campaign buttons to vote for el camino but thats a name better left for chevrolet while g8 st is in keeping with pontiacs switch to alpha numeric designations like g5 g6 and g8
3985912 frankly we were blown away by both the volume and quality of the names submitted
3985913 they could have kept it simple by calling it bbt for big boy toy
3985914 g8 refers to being a member of the car family st avoids using the term truck that today has negative connotations
3985915 in the end we felt it was more appropriate to honor the el caminos unique place as part of chevys heritage and not use that nameplate on a pontiac
3985916 john came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and some say he has a devil in him
3985917 remember the ladies and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors

3986190 back then the croats took an incredibly brutal action and killed many civilians but the west pretended they did not see it
3986191 not simply a totalitarian dictator at home but a super genius strategist in foreign affairs if anything unusual happens in his part of the world its all part of one of his wicked schemes
3986192 according to our free media the georgians didnt invade the land of the ossetians they merely tried to retake it as a child would bloodlessly and even quite playfully retake a shiny red ball from a playmate those evil russkies on the other hand attack on georgia at least those are the words our reporters are using
3986193 weve placed ourselves in a position that globally we dont have the wherewithal to do anything one would think under those circumstances wed shut up
3986194 95 percent of female suicide attacks occurred within the context of a military campaign against occupying forces
3986195 the main motives and circumstances that drive female suicide attackers are quite similar to those that drive men
3986196 is mainly a demand driven not a supply limited phenomenon
3986197 i think al qaeda has discovered that because a great job has been done they just cannot drive their vbieds vehicle borne improvised explosive devises like they used to we see an adjustment that is the suicide vest attack
3986198 women have the tactical advantage of evading arrest of disguising the bomb
3986199 the threat that the u s and israel face from the islamic republic of iran is today greater than ever
3986200 we israel are benefiting from one thing and that is the attack on the twin towers and the pentagon and the american struggle in iraq
3986201 the duty of americans to support an island of democracy in the middle east
3986202 threatens the security of the united states and its allies worldwide thats because jerusalem and israel are ground zero in the global battle between tyranny and democracy radicalism and moderation terrorism and freedom
3986203 the rabbis say in the talmud that a lot of rabbinic law is to put a fence around the torah so you dont get near to violating it well mccain has a series of very clear headed policies toward terrorism and islamic extremism that put extra layers behind his support for israel
3986204 jerusalem is not merely the capital of israel but the spiritual capital of jews and christians everywhere its the site of the first and second temples which housed the holy of holies and its the direction in which we jews face when we pray this glorious city of david is bound to the jewish people by an undeniable 3 000 year historical link
3986205 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
3986206 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilization development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behavior in scapegoating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq
3986207 the continuation of the presence of foreign forces in the country and certain wring policies and practices on the part of foreign forces there
3986208 there is a mechanism which is agreed between iraq and these countries on what these countries can do through the meeting of interior ministers of these countries through the expanded neighboring countries conferences which took place in kuwait and anther one that is going to take place in jordan in fall
3986209 we are going to continue these negotiations through diplomatic channels
3986210 we hope that any improvement in the relationship between iran and the u s will help the situation in iraq
3986211 it is noteworthy that despite these groundless allegations to date no single credible evidence has ever been presented to substantiate them
3986212 to the contrary several high ranking iraqi officials are on record stressing irans constructive role in the country and rejecting the solid allegation
3986213 the united states accuses iran because the two countries have as yet not resolved their outstanding disputes
3986214 the accusation is designed to stem irans rising regional influence which the u s itself helped to enhance by overthrowing two of the islamic republics most implacable enemies the taliban and saddam hussein regimes
3986215 in addition during these operations numerous jish al mahdi militia fighters and leaders of jish al mahdi associated highly trained special groups fled to iran where they received sanctuary
3986216 as far as the u s is concerned the accusation has the advantage of undermining irans image in the eyes of iraqi shiites by blaming iran for the nefarious activities of the discredited elements in the mahdi army
3986217 the allegations are also designed to provide credence for americas narrative that depicts iran as a deceitful untrustworthy and hypocritical power which while professing to support the central government in baghdad trains funds and arms iraqi prime minister nouri enemies
3986218 irans role in iraq is a byproduct of u s iran relations
3986219 when u s iran relations have stalled irans role in iraq would likely be unconstructive and when u s iran relations are cooperative then irans role in iraq might be cooperative it doesnt necessarily mean that the u s has to pull out from iraq
3986220 the security situation has improved not simply because of the surge but because of a host of other factors including the successful completion of ethnic cleansing in key areas and americas success in buying off former sunni insurgents
3986221 economic conditions the improving performance of the iraqi military the decision on the part of iran to lend greater support to the iraqi central government instead of shiite militias as well as blunders on the part of al qaeda and setbacks suffered by moqtada al sadr
3986222 the militants believe that the shia officials are from the badr militia who are trained and strongly directed by iran with of course the knowledge of the americans
3986223 the militants now sahwa members kept blocking import of goods from iran
3986224 they shot the shopkeepers who dealt with them so it was rare to see iranian chocolate or anything else with the partial government control by the shia especially in the last six months shopkeepers are now allowed to deal in iranian goods
3986225 if the u s launches an assault on iran ill be the first volunteer to fight on the side of the u s
3986226 iran enjoys influence through the men of the united iraqi alliance in the baghdad government as represented by the supreme islamic iraqi council siic and the dawa party
3986227 the governor made a deal to import cooking oil from iran at a very high price that has never been seen before
3986228 i think the iranian influence will remain as long as there are such men as the governor raad rashid jawad in the province
3986229 the province was and still is the worst because of this corrupt administration
3986230 the iraqi government gives 5 million per month to the iranian side to cover the cost of the electricity to diyala province
3986231 we dont have a representative government here or in baghdad because of the heavy iranian influence
3986232 that influence favors only those who support them and injures those of us who do not
3986233 that would be very expensive and its certainly not for sale

3986249 far from impinging on this new nuclear buildup the bush putin agreement will help to facilitate it by creating a smokescreen behind which a new generation of nuclear weapons will be developed
3986250 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3986251 we are promoting and developing a strategy to increase the quality and quantity of those products
3986252 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the backto school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
3986253 i think there are too many negatives and the negatives are too large for a gasoline price decline to change the story significantly
3986254 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3986255 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3986256 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3986257 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3986258 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3986259 advances in higher fuelefficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3986260 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
3986261 the problem is that this contribution is still mainly in the informal sector
3986262 the challenge cambodian women face is not just to access employment but decent better paying employment
3986263 positive trends towards greater equality include increasing girls enrolment in primary education and resulting rises in female literacy and expanded employment opportunities
3986264 to raise their participation in formal employment and decision making institutions women need skills and information about how markets and the law function
3986265 when you talk about increasing womens participation in the labour force you have to be very specific about what kind of participation you are talking about
3986266 are you talking about the informal sector where women are already heavily represented or 8 am to 5 pm professional jobs
3986267 we are not going to increase womens participation in professional jobs until we have things like adequate child care facilities care for older people and salaries that keep up with the cost of living
3986268 in order to participate in economic activity and contribute to the economy you have to be healthy
3986269 the high rate of maternal mortality while declining is a real concern and a real challenge we need to look at why with all the aid we have received this has not decreased more in the past
3986270 this is also a cultural problem the woman is the last to get medical attention after the children and the father they are in bad shape by the time they come to the doctor
3986271 have improved at all levels of education the female share of enrolment drops at each higher level of education
3986272 the cambodian government is committed to increasing education opportunities for women at all levels from primary school to university during the next five year mandate
3986273 we have some vocational training centres now but not enough and they are not responding to demand this is important in the context of the garment industry which we not only want to stay in cambodia but to value add and not just use labour
3986274 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3986275 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3986276 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3986277 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3986278 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3986279 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3986280 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3986281 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3986282 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3986283 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3986284 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3986285 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3986306 that was aimed at seeing whether humans could do the same thing as for example mice could females pick out the smell of genetically similar or dissimilar males
3986307 we found that the preferences of women having gone on the pill shifted toward genetic similarity
3986308 it suggests that it is specifically the hormonal levels within the pill
3986309 both in terms of successful pregnancies carrying babies to term and potentially in terms of your relationship quality
3986310 the women who were relatively similar to their partner genetically reported lower relationship satisfaction and a greater likelihood of going off to seek affairs

3986327 their occult appears to be widespread here in savannah to identify which of them will be the next
3986328 practice went really good in the morning everyone looked really good
3986329 getting on the field felt really good we cant wait to get back out there again
3986330 the new field gives even more excitement to the start of the season
3986331 it looks really nice everything is coming together weve got a lot of nice stuff hopefully we can play well too
3986332 theres a lot to be excited about it will be another fun year here
3986333 were more experienced this year were more intense and were working harder this year
3986334 we see that clock in the weight room every day and its amazing how close the season opener is getting we cant wait
3986335 its just a great time of year its a little different today because of all the things we do in the summer but theres still a different excitement when we start the season as opposed to what we do in the summer
3986336 i told the kids today this is an exciting opportunity
3986337 theres a lot of kids who dont do this and you are you have the opportunity to play a great game with good people
3986338 i thought lets shake things up a bit maybe going later in the day will be cooler
3986339 we may fall flat on our faces and have this the worst thing weve ever done and next year well go back to 8 in the morning but right now we are going afternoons and evenings
3986340 if we were back home we couldnt get anything established its just a nice atmosphere plus im a bit of a farm boy i like having the cornfield in the background
3986341 theres no real guarantee the kids were here in the summer so the ihsa knows everyone has to have three days of non contact this way every kid is safe
3986342 i think well play our best game the last game
3986343 the next week and half is not going to be easy
3986344 i think the kids like the first day of practice better than they like the second day
3986345 we had a decent summer camp and that showed today a little bit we started right over again and theyve pretty much got the base plays already which should help with the terminology changing and things like that
3986346 i was kind of scared when i first heard about the coaching change because its your senior year and youre supposed to know the ropes already
3986347 i thought wed come in and be just as lost as the freshmen but bierman has done an amazing job of catering to us asking what we like to do its a different spin basically
3986348 footballs football but every rung on the ladder you climb theres that much more responsibility
3986349 youve got to manage the whole program not just your team or position group youve got to be prepared and organized at all times
3986350 were going to get a lot done and were going to win a lot of games this year
3986351 coach gehrig brings a lot of adrenaline to the table
3986352 but that will only get us better for the season
3986353 our numbers are good were off to a good start as far as work ethic and attitude desire is pretty high right now and were really looking forward to the upcoming season
3986354 weve got very good competition at every position and i think thats only going to make us better nothings set and i think thats going to be a good thing for us
3986355 i really dont feel satisfied with what we did last year
3986356 theres an uproar this year to do something in the playoffs
3986357 a lot of the kids didnt like what happened against mount carmel
3986358 after that game we said we could be that team next year that goes far in the playoffs
3986359 the question is what has this team accomplished and thats nothing
3986360 there is no last year there only is what we will do
3986361 but with prospect and rolling meadows still if someone says the msl you think of those teams
3986362 we were embarrassed by palatine 27 0 and rolling meadows 35 6 so we still have chips on our shoulders we know our business isnt finished and we have to keep working harder
3986363 when you look at the prospects the buffalo groves and the rolling meadows over these years theyve maintained
3986364 each of them has had their ups and downs but havent had a low or the the lows as weve had here we want to maintain and continue to improve
3986365 we have to bring a lot of fun to the table
3986366 if you dont have a lot of fun youre not going to play at your peak
3986367 especially with us going 5 4 and making it to the title game the conference schedule definitely prepared us for the playoffs
3986368 with three teams in state championship games that was pretty awesome
3986369 i think we proved to everyone that we play in a pretty tough conference
3986370 its going to be another great year in the conference we hope to be a big factor in the race
3986371 the top 10 to 15 in the state are as solid as they are every year
3986372 if you dont have a d i offer by now theres a good chance you will not get one
3986373 its gotten so early thats what its come down to colleges are already working on the junior class at this point
3986374 our no 1 concern was replacing an entire offensive staff
3986375 im not patting myself on the back but i think weve replaced some great coaches with some great new coaches theyve been players here so its always nice to bring back your own
3986376 they always say the hardest thing to do is to teach kids how to win
3986377 the first time i saw it on the schedule i guess there were some reservations about it
3986378 we played them in the finals and i didnt think wed get the chance to play them again obviously its a different group of kids and a different coaching staff but personally you get a chance to play lake zurich again
3986379 its definitely something to look forward to joliet catholic has the most storied history in the state its just a great high school football matchup
3986380 morris to me is probably one of the top five programs in the state traditionally and historically
3986381 so to play morris i think is a great measuring point for driscoll and they grow them big down there
3986382 hopefully it gets done this week but until i see it you know how that goes
3986383 itll create a lot of opportunities that kids didnt have by playing on saturdays and it gives the kids a little bit better break on the weekend in the long run i think its going to be a win win for everybody
3986384 it was nice to see st francis spend the money to go green theyre going to use less electricity
3986385 they provide everything we needed in our environment as an athlete i think the kids are going to notice the difference these are phenomenal phenomenal lights
3986386 i cant tell you how many times he has told me dont worry claire
3986387 at the end of the day the project will proceed
3986388 i am not trying to stop the project im trying to make sure that the project is fair
3986389 i really cant say but theres plenty of evidence that they cant be trusted
3986390 hook me up with a hot girl who i love and she loves me back and we go on over x number of dates and get 1000 of course some might split the money with their female friends
3986391 we are the only industry that so loves its colonel parkers and so distrusts its elvis presleys
3986392 wait no i think i might be in the wrong place
3986393 i think with broadly flat output its bound to be the case that there is a possibility of a quarter or two of negative growth
3986394 we will come through it inflation will come down and we will resume a pattern of normal growth
3986395 but the unique combination of food and energy price rises and the dislocation of the financial sector will make a difficult adjustment for the uk economy
3986396 the bank of englands august inflation report will be seen as rather more dovish than might have been expected given the recent dreadful news on inflation
3986397 interest rates will eventually fall very sharply once inflation pressures finally recede
3986398 for some institutions they are over the worst and for other perhaps not but i think we have certainly moved some long way down the road
3986399 its the lenders who should take the risk and assess for themselves the riskiness of that lending and what we saw in the first half of 2007 was that not enough attention was paid to monitoring the riskiness of that lending
3986400 men think that the fastest way to go to a point is to go straight
3986401 women know that the faster way to go to a point is to go to the curves
3986402 i read the script and the very human story and the very core of this film spoke to me very clearly this is a departure from the very big hollywood productions
3986403 calling it a cover up would be far too dramatic but for more than half a century even i the midst of some of the greatest scientific achievements in history physicists have been quietly aware of a dark cloud looming on a distant horizon
3986404 it had been like dying sliding down that mountain pass

3986406 itll be fun to do things weve put off for a long time
3986407 that initiative they took to invite us here was the beginning of the downtown renaissance
3986408 i didnt know one end of the needle from another
3986409 im working on my sixth quilt now i absolutely love it
3986410 she taught me about quilt construction how to date the material how to date the quilts
3986411 until youve done it you cant appreciate all the work thats gone into those old quilts with no lighting and no tools
3986412 in those quilts women sewed the emotions of what was going on around them
3986413 all the time men were making history women have been the core of society raising children and tending the fires
3986414 quilts compared to other things in museums are more personal
3986415 it took a lot of work to get the quilts together
3986416 wait no i think i might be in the wrong place
3986417 god im 22 crystal the baby is 19 what are you doing

3986422 x is true because the bible or the church says so
3986423 it was in this period 1519 20 that he developed from just one more reformer attacking the abuses and corruption of a decaying bureaucracy into the leader of an intellectual revolt that was to shake the very foundations of western civilization
3986424 john calvin who led his own challenge to authority in the 1520s made the reformations claim to certainty still more explicit the faithful are illuminated through the activity of the holy spirit
3986425 who is so demented that he would die for denial of the obvious
3986426 revealed in most shocking fashion the perspectives that could be opened up by abandoning the entire scholastic way of understanding and replacing it by pious human study
3986427 erasmus ridiculed the whole intellectual and moral world built up to support christendom
3986428 hume was the guy you didnt want to be against you kant was the guy you didnt want on your side
3986429 i become emotional when i pay and thus there must be an object of my emotional feelings

3986442 none are conventional mls vendors we think what we can build is something based on technology used by sites like trulia zillow google

3986444 they were based on historical mls boundaries that had no relationship to the marketplace
3986445 we never launched coverage in those countries because we simply werent satisfied with the map data we had available

3986496 im very pleased that finally justice has been done mainly for my soldiers because it was them who actually fought face to face with the enemy mr smith said
3986497 they fought over and above what would be expected of young national service soldiers with very little experience he said
3986498 they repelled wave after wave of assaulting suicidal attacks and not one of the enemy got inside our position thanks to them
3986499 it was just sad that we lost 18 soldiers that day
3986500 its good to see a situation where we are now getting some justice with respect to these long standing issues he said

3986503 watching whats been happening in other places ive become increasingly aware of the publics frustration with elected officials who abuse authority
3986504 people in montgomery county should know that there is a place they can go if they believe someone is abusing public authority
3986505 creating a special unit and putting specialized prosecutors and agents on it raises the level in the publics mind and in the criminal justice system of these types of crimes
3986506 it goes to the heart of democracy people have to have faith in their elected officials that they abide by the law
3986507 this ill conceived policy has resulted in crimes that attack the basic rights of the citizens of coatesville
3986508 the dark forces of lawlessness that fester within the blighted recesses of our city
3986509 everybody on section 8 is not into drugs or criminal activity
3986510 quite honestly its time for the city to take back what belongs to us our streets and our homes
3986511 there is a level of fear amongst the folks who live in the city and thats ridiculous
3986512 education is important in getting young people to understand their worth
3986513 in a lot of ways drug dealers are like roaches we squash one and then another comes in
3986514 he was very elusive we had trouble getting information about him
3986515 we heard him talking about settling the score with guns and muscles and what he was going to do to retaliate
3986516 oftentimes these robberies between drug dealers turn into murder we couldnt allow that to happen
3986517 its fundamentally a question about the integrity of the park at a place like valley forge the land is part of the historic character
3986518 mr selim always knew he was blameless for the wrongful destruction of pans business
3986519 on one fateful day in 2003 the tga wrongfully took away pans licence and recalled all of its product
3986520 i alleged that these people knew full well the catastrophic effect their decision would have on pan its employees customers service providers shareholders and of course me and my family both financially and personally
3986521 the commonwealth has consented to judgment in the face of these pleaded claims
3986522 misguided feelings of vengeance arising from a failed prosecution against pan in the early 1990s
3986523 we try to expose these young people to as many positive experiences as possible anything that will help them succeed in college
3986524 we provide the opportunities but theyre the ones who have to put in the work
3986525 it was like immaculate thats one of my new words i like to use
3986526 these kids have excellent coping skills for the streets of chester unfortunately theyre not always transferable

3986528 she was obviously very bright and both her parents were working and living at home she defied all the stereotypes and yet her ignorance was appalling it was not her fault but a criminal failure of the system of education

3986542 he murdered her in cold blood and he is a cold blooded killer
3986543 as a father i have to have my son held accountable for what he did
3986544 andrew knew the consequences of pointing that gun at any person and andrew knew the consequences of pulling that trigger and he chose to pull the trigger and kill my daughter
3986545 you of course have to get a good deal of psychological evaluation see what his mental makeup and process was at the time the shooting took place
3986546 i would ask that he remains in prison for the rest of his life
3986547 i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3986548 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit
3986549 i positioned myself in front of the cockpit i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3986550 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3986551 i think people need to be held accountable for their actions
3986552 nope try us next week not sure if well have one then or ever
3986553 why yes actually we have two at the moment would you like to purchase one
3986554 so once upon a time there was this beautiful princess

3986560 i didnt like the recruiting part ive always been a teacher at heart
3986561 but i do remember the relief of qualifying 10 days before the games i remember the depression of losing our first game to japan i remember our comeback against czechoslovakia that is still vivid
3986562 dare to be yourself everything is now wide open just go and get it
3986563 we do not trust brands anymore we trust individuals friendly familiar authority figures with whom we feel great affinity these are the people we trust and those from whom we would always welcome honest suggestions and tips and when they are spontaneous or clearly disclosed even those of commercial nature
3986564 bottom up advertising with publishers selecting the favorite brands they would want to endorse
3986565 in reality bloggers or other similar online authority figures could publicly pre elect companies and brands that they would want to be brand ambassadors for they could do this directly on their sites and or via their representative advertising agencies this advertising model would provide companies embracing it with a communication vehicle with much higher impact and effectiveness that anything they have done so far via traditional advertising it is likely that such brands would need multiple such brand ambassadors addressing the many different target audiences making up their potential customer base to independent publishers and online bloggers this advertising model would offer the opportunity to re synch communication with marketing instead of keeping them tightly separate while guaranteeing also a longer and more stable revenue stream it would also offer the opportunity for individual publishers to leverage their authority and influence to convey messages and promotions for products and companies they truly believe in
3986566 yes you say but you are going to be influenced by those who pay you yes i answer but so do you with the people that spend big money on your site with traditional advertising and if that is not so how in any case can people tell how can they find out whether the new review article or link you did was a consequence of a return favor you are doing to an advertising agency or to a past direct advertiser who would want to come back unless you have some very strict and public disclosure policy about this info it is going only through your actions over time that people will be able to tell whether you have your own integrity or whether you are simply a marketing puppet at the service of whoever pays you more
3986567 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
3986568 and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire
3986569 and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever
3986570 i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
3986571 it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
3986572 who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree
3986573 by his own blood obtained eternal redemption for us amp cleanseth us from all sin
3986574 repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out
3986575 you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins
3986576 old things are passed away behold all things are become new

3986578 basic transportation will no longer be enough for increasingly empowered consumers they want an automotive experience that matches their lifestyles and lets them move seamlessly from life inside the vehicle to their world outside
3986579 in the face of such significant and chaotic change finding clarity will require the automotive industry to take sweeping and rapid action two of the greatest areas of opportunity are meeting consumer demands for environmental accountability and using technology to transform the way the industry develops products and goes to market

3986581 i do indeed think that we can now know almost nothing concerning the life and personality of jesus since the early christian sources show no interest in either and are moreover fragmentary and often legendary
3986582 it is impossible to use electric light and the wireless and to avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical discoveries and at the same time to believe in the new testament world of spirits and miracles
3986583 its difficult to imagine a circumstance where the government could directly control interest rates without a whole range of adverse consequences occurring a whole range of other things mr tanner told abc radio
3986584 weve seen it in the past for example where we had a cap on interest rates
3986585 what that meant was that people ended up with cocktail loans for their homes where they borrowed a proportion of their mortgage at the official interest rate and had to borrow the rest at a really high interest rate much much higher than the official rate
3986586 now i wouldnt speculate about what they might be and of course its not my direct responsibility mr tanner said
3986587 well cross that bridge if and when we come to it if we believe that the banks are not doing the right thing then clearly we will be examining the options to put greater pressure on
3986588 rolled gold guarantees on rates because theyve got other factors that they have to worry about as well
3986589 australia is concerned that despite the announcement of a ceasefire agreement which commits both sides to a cessation of all hostilities and the withdrawal of troops to positions held before the conflict broke out there have been reports of ongoing military action by russian forces
3986590 australia calls on russia to honour the terms of the ceasefire respect the territorial integrity of georgia and resolve its differences with georgia through peaceful means
3986591 the military action taken by russia has been disproportionate and has resulted in widespread damage and heavy casualties
3986592 a further 500 000 has been allocated to the international committee of the red cross icrc for the immediate provision of medical supplies to hospitals and the deployment of field hospitals for critical surgery in gori and south ossetia
3986593 cabinet will look at what further measures will be possible to reduce the pressure on a system
3986594 there is much much more to be done and we are working hard on this
3986595 the core reason for the pressure on the system being we are in the middle of an appallingly low level of rainfall and i cant make it rain
3986596 you cant turn the queen mary around to be sailing in a particular direction for the last 12 years in six months
3986597 crude has regained some of its losses over the past few trading sessions reacting to the inventory report which showed very substantial stock draws in gasoline said victor shum an analyst with energy consultancy purvin and gertz in singapore
3986598 concerns about the us economy and now the spread of the economic slowdown to europe and asia could push crude oil pricing to test lower lows because some of the supply issues have been discounted by the market mr shum said
3986599 the supply issues should really become relevant again at some point and this is likely to backstop the drop in oil pricing he said
3986600 these issues have not disappeared they have simply been discounted
3986601 the charges against mr villegas are part of a larger investigation that encompasses mr mcdougle and that investigation is ongoing
3986602 i have not heard from anyone the district attorney or the fbi that there was anything new of relevance against my client
3986603 maybe they were preoccupied with other life issues or selfish or stupid or stubborn
3986604 if your normal happy go lucky 12 year old child cant walk unaided for a period of weeks screams in pain cant shower wet and soils herself in her clothes if no one helps her to the toilet cries in the night and cant walk the next day you shouldnt need any medical training to have worked out that she is a very very sick young girl
3986605 the standard of care was not breached in this case
3986606 all of the foundation of the crown case is simply false i am asking you ladies and gentleman to put an end to all of this just end it for gods sake and allow her ms reynolds to grieve
3986607 if it is your view that facs should have done more well perhaps they should have
3986608 perhaps they should have done a lot more before this day
3986609 a man may deal with theory and miss the whole impact of the truth
3986610 if the senate does conduct an additional review it is essential its terms of reference are broad ranging to achieve real outcomes for indigenous australians
3986611 we have to take the politics out of this debate
3986612 in order to achieve a lasting impact a review by the senate would need to consider historical funding arrangements for indigenous services since 1978
3986613 it would need to assess the backlog in health education housing and infrastructure and determine whether commonwealth funding support is adequate
3986614 the slow adoption of vista among businesses and budget conscious cios coupled with the proven success of a new type of microsoft free pc provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for linux
3986615 the slow take up of vista has resulted in the extension of xps life with microsoft selling it half price to pc makers microsoft does not have a great product in vista but it will not be muscled out
3986616 it has such dominance that even the linux pc makers have no intention of overtaking microsoft they just want a little bit of market share
3986617 those already using open source are probably the most technologically self sufficient theyre not going to pay to give up their autonomy
3986618 why would i go to a firm to buy what i can get off the web free without the associated overhead of dealing with a large organisation possibly because there is support quality assurance and training provided by the becta framework supplier for example
3986619 in practice even the implementation of bsf varies so there is probably scope to use open source outside the bsf offer
3986620 if schools want open source at the moment they must go outside the framework

3986631 some commentators have suggested the government establish an aussie mac as a mechanism to inject liquidity into the market and provide a price discovery function in times of severe market stress treasury executive director markets group jim murphy told a a federal parliamentary committee hearing in sydney
3986632 it appears that for some the aussie mac proposal is seen as a mechanism to address the current problems in securitisation markets
3986633 treasury strongly disagrees with this in that the treasurer has ruled out establishing a government body of this nature
3986634 we think its important to note that underlying australias rmbs markets are high quality assets and it is expected that once some normality returns to the market this will assist in accumulating demand for rmbs and restoring this funding channel
3986635 one can only speculate why superannuation funds are not involved in this but they make their own decisions
3986636 we have recently seen a decrease in the bank bill rate of approximately 40 basis points resulting in a fall of the cost of raising new funds he said
3986637 we saw the banks increase their interest rates when funding costs went up
3986638 on the same token we expect lenders to pass on any reduction in funding costs to their customers in a timely way
3986639 ik ben wel heel blij dat de strafcorners goed gaan
3986640 verder denk ik niet aan de scores we zijn alweer met ons hoofd bij australi
3986641 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
3986642 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
3986643 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
3986644 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
3986645 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
3986646 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
3986647 we are currently studying the legal details of the case for extradition
3986648 this is our priority we will proceed as soon as possible
3986649 were already experiencing that in traffic congestion in schools and in our crowded coastal areas

3986657 yes i know i have an invisible illness and feel more comfortable taking the elevator thanks
3986658 we expect a considerable number of people to return home today since late wednesday they were slowly going back we are assuring them of their safety
3986659 the security situation has improved but it will probably take a bit of time before people feel secure enough to return home en masse
3986660 we have to be looking ahead to people having to potentially rebuild their lives a lot of houses villages have been destroyed
3986661 some of them need a little counselling most do not a lot of them are used to it its not the first time that this has happened
3986662 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3986663 gm crops are not to blame for climate change the industrialization of agriculture the spread of dysfunctional conurbations the salinization of australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the prince appears to accuse them
3986664 while i admire prince charless commitment to environmental causes his lack of scientific understanding and his willingness to condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa is absolutely bewildering
3986665 you cant just push them into the jungles and wait you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then peace can come
3986666 the rebel military installations and civilian areas are mixed if the army advances further and confines the rebels into a smaller region then civilian vulnerability will increase
3986667 there are no restrictions and there is no shortage we send food and other essentials as per the request of the senior government official in those areas
3986668 the silence of the international community especially by neighbouring india over the displacement and suffering of tamils is disturbing

3986673 certain actions be taken to prevent fatigue cracking on critical areas of the forward pressure bulkhead which could result in rapid decompression of the aircraft fuselage
3986674 not a safety issue my arse these aircraft may have been flying for up to five years with missing parts
3986675 it fails to take into account that qantas as is always the case received the approval of boeing and casa for this work before it was undertaken
3986676 all modifications qantas performed on the boeing 737 aircraft were to a standard specifically approved by boeing and casa
3986677 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past regular lubrication and checking of the jack screw is vital because corrosion poses a real risk and must be eliminated to prevent this key component from seizing up
3986678 boeing issued a directive that this component needed to be checked more rigorously and more regularly
3986679 there was a maintenance issue involving the lubrication of a jack screw on a boeing 747 400 qantas found this through a routine check of our maintenance records
3986680 the jack screw had been inspected and the aircraft will operate tomorrow
3986681 there is no connection at all with any other aircraft incident
3986682 the alaska incident involved a different aircraft type and design with different safety features

3986689 the search committee will be screening and interviewing candidates doing site visits and putting forward a recommendation
3986690 being on this committee is a fairly short term commitment but there will be an aggressive schedule
3986691 we plan to come forward with a recommendation by the end of november or early december
3986692 its the kind of mosquito that bites birds not people
3986693 they wont tell us the exact location because they dont want people to go out there and interfere with their traps
3986694 for most people they might experience flu like symptoms with west nile but except for perhaps the elderly or infants it is not anything like triple e
3986695 fortunately there have been no cases of triple e reported in massachusetts this year it goes on a seven year cycle and i think we are in a down year after all the activity we had
3986696 we are pleased to know that we will soon begin construction on the memorial path stairway which has been under design for several years not only will this structure welcome our visitors and guide them from our main parking lot to the visitor center but its ancillary aspects will assist our physically challenged guests the path stairway will be attractively built and beautifully landscaped using native shade plants
3986697 the grant from the massachusetts cultural facilities fund will certainly help us bring this long planned improvement to fruition
3986698 our walk is paradise in comparison to those who leave their families and walk treacherous trails into a world of robbery rape and murder
3986699 the north american dream has life threatening difficulties attached to it ask those whove fallen off trains and lost limbs
3986700 is someone who understands our struggle it is rare to see such compassion and companerismo from someone who is suffering himself from the sickness of cancer that jim can keep up his support for mayans and other central americans mexicans and others in this time is a testament to his love and faith
3986701 we are going to be examining maintenance records pilot training records obviously we will be waiting on autopsy and toxicology reports as we always do and in addition learning more about this operation angel flight and how they operate
3986702 your altitude is going up and down are you all right sir
3986703 a post crash fire consumed the cockpit cabin and portion of the left wing
3986704 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3986705 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3986706 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces
3986707 the car was clearly marked they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in humanitarian community in afghanistan
3986708 since they oppose the current government they also oppose those who work with it
3986709 and unfortunately they dont differentiate among armed multinational forces security contractors and humanitarian groups
3986710 the irc provides lifesaving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3986711 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3986712 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3986713 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3986714 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3986715 so many people are being hurt by these high gas prices and it just caught america by surprise they just werent ready for these adjustments that need to be made
3986716 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
3986717 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
3986718 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3986719 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
3986720 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3986721 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3986722 there is no more fire season as we know it the fire season is now all year round
3986723 california is suffering from the same thing everyone else is
3986724 without question americas fire situation has changed its not going to go back
3986725 we cant afford not to fight fires homes and lives are at stake
3986726 these fires are only going to become more frequent and more intense
3986727 then and from a distance i admired very much the way she handled a uniquely difficult situation with uncomplaining grace
3986728 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3986729 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3986730 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3986731 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3986732 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
3986733 she loved talking to kids because they would ask more honest questions
3986734 adults would kind of stand back and stare and not know how to approach her
3986735 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
3986736 after all the effort that we put in to get somebody a fair trial and then to say no matter what we did it didnt matter i dont see that as a positive step
3986737 i think it was generally our opinion that hamdan made some bad mistakes in his life that led him down a path that turned out to be a bad one once he was in it i dont see that it was that easy to get out
3986738 the fact that he apologized that didnt sound like al qaida to me
3986739 if the first guy is getting a 30 year sentence what do you do for a real hard core criminal
3986740 there are moments when we wonder whether all this was worthwhile or not
3986741 i can tell you that what we are doing at the moment is sending a signal that the u n is back the u n is back to stay
3986742 we have to be able to move a lot of the investment to the private sector
3986743 our biggest way of improving security is to make sure that young people are employed
3986744 the iraqi people are not ready to take over for themselves
3986745 iraqis do not yet know how to run a government and it is going to take some time to make this government function
3986746 it brings the whole u n organization together in partnership with iraq and its people to reduce poverty foster growth and consolidate democracy in our country
3986747 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
3986748 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
3986749 a necessary condition for an end to the current global financial crisis
3986750 stable home prices will clarify the level of equity in homes the ultimate collateral support for much of the financial worlds mortgage backed securities we wont really know the market value of the asset side of the banking systems balance sheet and hence banks capital until then
3986751 its the imbalance of supply and demand which causes prices to go down but its ultimately the valuation process of the use of the commodity which tells you where the bottom is
3986752 for example the grain markets can have a huge excess of corn or wheat but the price never goes to zero itll stabilize at some level of prices where people are willing to hold the excess inventory we have little history but the same thing is surely true in housing as well we will get to the point where there will be willing holders of vacant single family dwellings and that will no longer act to depress the price level
3986753 theres no credible argument for bailing out bear stearns and not the gses
3986754 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted with necessary taxpayer support to make them financially viable as five or 10 individual privately held units
3986755 this legislation accomplished two important goals providing confidence in the immediate term as these institutions play a critical role in weathering the housing correction and putting in place a new regulator with all the authorities necessary to address systemic risk posed by the gses
3986756 if they are too big to fail make them smaller
3986757 the law that stipulates that gses are not backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government is disbelieved the market believes the government guarantee is there foreigners believe the guarantee is there the only fiscal change is for someone to change the bookkeeping
3986758 its hard to escape the conclusion that at some point our extraordinary housing boom
3986759 while local economies may experience significant speculative price imbalances a national severe price distortion seems most unlikely in the united states given its size and diversity
3986760 i think the worst of this may well be over
3986761 the most effective initiative though politically difficult would be a major expansion in quotas for skilled immigrants
3986762 perhaps 150 000 of those are loosely classified as skilled
3986763 a double or tripling of this number would markedly accelerate the absorption of unsold housing inventory for sale and hence help stabilize prices
3986764 i was scared i didnt want him to hurt me anymore
3986765 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
3986766 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
3986767 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
3986768 as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
3986769 in this case it was determined that we need to move forward in a timely fashion
3986770 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
3986771 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3986772 has brutally pushed this military operation well beyond the bounds of anything that might have related to
3986773 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
3986774 the united states has supported those efforts now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3986775 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
3986776 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3986777 either support for a virtual project or real partnership on issues that really demand collective action
3986778 there are confused reports and varying reports that are coming in
3986779 its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
3986780 i led in the abramoff hearings in the in the obscure indian affairs committee for which people are still testifying and going to jail
3986781 mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption
3986782 i take the long view of politics which is that yesterdays opponent can be tomorrows friend or ally
3986783 no position title or official role in the mccain campaign and am not seeking one
3986784 will be coming to atlanta on august 18 for a very special event at the marriott marquis downtown and i have agreed to serve as a member of the mccain victory 2008 team
3986785 if you select to use your credit card you may fax the form to me
3986786 its laughable democrats would try to make this a political issue considering john mccain led the abramoff investigations and has a record of fighting to reform washington
3986787 do you think you might be able to contact karl as i am sure you have more weight there
3986788 talked to rove about this and i think i killed it hes on it keep this between us dont want to raise expectations but i banged on this one hard
3986789 our edge is our employees and our knowledge of the business
3986790 we have to work hard to support our existing businesses and help them grow while at the same time developing a climate that attracts new businesses and jobs
3986791 the glassmans and their employees are a real example of what exists new bedford works for business
3986792 it is a trend that is not favorable to us
3986793 the possibility of a continued decline in sales tax revenue should serve as a reminder that while we want to get each district the best possible facility some extras might have to be scaled back
3986794 if we can save a roof today more than likely we will not have to rebuild a building in five years
3986795 everyone had an opinion when it came to designing the sign and then there was finding the right parts that fit into the thing ordering parts and getting them in took a long time i know everybody thought it wouldnt get done but i never thought that
3986796 theres a feeling of accomplishment there were obstacles but i was able to overcome the task at a young age thats part of what the eagle scout project is about i didnt think the obstacles would be that big but looking back id probably do it again
3986797 being an eagle scout means youre definitely dedicated to something you have to have maturity a sense of responsibility leadership and i think its the first step into adulthood
3986798 our scout troop used to be small but it got an influx of 13 little kids
3986799 thats how we all start we have around 20 kids right now a couple of them are there just to go camping and have fun a couple of my friends and i were there for serious scouting scholarships and to have fun
3986800 marine biology just puts it all together for a good mix
3986801 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
3986802 i think there are too many negatives and the negatives are too large for a gasoline price decline to change the story significantly
3986803 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
3986804 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
3986805 it is a much more common scenario today than it would have been even five years ago
3986806 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
3986807 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope
3986808 at that point zachary was so sick we did have him at home but we knew it wasnt much longer
3986809 hes just a crazy little kid who loves to play and swim and throw rocks
3986810 addison did only live three days in this world but because of this she lives on
3986811 there will be civilian flaggers on massachusetts roads this fall
3986812 i think it will be very apparent to people as these projects get under way
3986813 this proposal strikes an appropriate balance between public safety and efficiency
3986814 its only the beginning the regulations will cover only a small fraction of state and local highways the public is not going to see any immediate dramatic change at all
3986815 the key will be to make inroads on local roads
3986816 if a handful of municipalities start doing it then others will follow i hope over the next few months the administration will work with cities and towns to begin to make changes
3986817 gov patrick came into office pledging to put 1 000 police on the street
3986818 this is going to take 1 000 police off the street we think that public safety will suffer in the long run
3986819 we are not looking to shut all 104 lights off we are considering shutting 30 off based on what the police chief recommended
3986820 the clock is ticking it is getting darker earlier we need to move this along
3986821 its creating a political climate where immigrants are seen as a net benefit to the state
3986822 the states highest office holder is sending a message that his state welcomes immigrants
3986823 were it not for immigrants and refugees massachusetts would have seen a population decline in the last seven years
3986824 immigrants are becoming increasingly important to the health of the state economy
3986825 its in the best interest of the state communities and immigrant families to expedite their integration
3986826 they are old and a maintenance nightmare i cant see continuing to throw perfectly good money into them
3986827 if small towns didnt have chapter 90 their whole infrastructure would go into the cesspool
3986828 now isnt this better than sitting at a table a girl hasnt got but two sides to her at the table
3986829 what direction does each of us want society to go and how
3986830 it was unlike anything the village has experienced in recent history
3986831 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3986832 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3986833 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
3986834 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
3986835 jack reads to her an hour a day as part of his home schooling
3986836 the world is whizzing around her and shes cool as a cucumber saying jack just started can i call you back
3986837 shes been dedicated for 23 years now its just time to move on to doing other things
3986838 i do not think either one of the craigs like the way things in the village are going
3986839 shes been a model of dedication and leadership and caring thats what i see
3986840 never forget that you are here to meet the needs of the people of hanover park
3986841 were going to have so many empty stores its ridiculous
3986842 nothing personal bill but i think especially at this time when were looking at cracking down on landlords and the condition of our rental units in the city i believe the entire board of the aurora housing authority needs to be replaced
3986843 im not saying its any one individual but its obviously not working there is nobody that can look at that and say that organization is working properly it is a huge problem in this city
3986844 right now theyre a warehouse full of low income renters and theyre doing nothing to help those people succeed and exit the system
3986845 the conditions some of these folks live in are appalling
3986846 rentals are not a blight to this community and they never have been especially with our scattered site houses
3986847 you wouldnt be able to pick our home out of any neighborhood we have them in because we dont want them to stand out
3986848 we attempt to get our tenants involved in local social services but the constant turnover rate we face and our funding levels makes that difficult
3986849 negative impact they have on our school district police department and community and as a whole
3986850 they dont understand their role and as far as im concerned theyre there to pick up a 75 check twice a month
3986851 maybe they got involved to help but they quickly got in over their heads and havent bothered to get out
3986852 this is an excellent board every single one of them is very involved in the community and the housing authority
3986853 theyre all aurora residents and are very involved in the city they live in
3986854 were making policy based on only receiving 81 percent of our funding and that has always been a concern
3986855 i dont know any other entity that could operate as well as we do with a 19 percent cut in funding
3986856 i agree with lawrence and share many of his concerns about the housing authority
3986857 but that is a discussion we all need to have for a decision that we all need to make that decision cannot be made by one person
3986858 were going to use the information we received from those stakeholders and the information we receive at the meting to put together a preliminary plan
3986859 currently the industrial market based upon the expansion of ohare is dictating redevelopment from smaller industrial and warehouse facilities into larger logistic and airfreight facilities
3986860 they are forcing me to lie because they want to convict kenny smith
3986861 they told me if i dont give them the testimony they want me to testify to theyll revoke my plea agreement
3986862 at the end of the day it wasnt in the budget and that budget was approved by the entire village board
3986863 where did the money go i want to know what the hell went on
3986864 i want to know exactly how much money should have been in there with accrued interest how much money is there now and if in fact there is a deficit exactly how much it is
3986865 we dont want projections we dont want guesstimates we ought to know to the penny exactly where its at
3986866 we have never been given any kind of accounting or tally sheet that represents where we are how much money was in the ssa
3986867 the board of trustees has never been provided anything more than year end summaries of what was spent that particular year we havent been given a formal report about what money is left
3986868 if we were doing our jobs in terms of reporting and keeping track of whats going on we would have known about this a long time ago
3986869 is the village board to blame for not watching this more closely there are those who would say we are and ultimately that buck stops with me
3986870 if somebody is giving us bad information then we are going to make bad decisions
3986871 we are not suddenly going to discover it the money in some bank account we forgot about
3986872 its gone really what we need to focus on in my mind it isnt so much where the money went but what are we going to do about it now
3986873 i just go on stage and do im used to it
3986874 its more than just the movie one of the cut scenes from the movie was the jitterbugs
3986875 the four characters trying to find their way going through all that hard stuff
3986876 i have to be afraid of everything and im not normally
3986877 it was either incorporate or be swallowed up by streamwood and forever lose their identity
3986878 from camelot to metropolis a chronical of ontarioville and hanover park illinois
3986879 i look at this as a new beginning a celebration of who we are and what we represent
3986880 this must be an age of restoration restoring the natural resources of this country so that the younger generation will not inherit a country in which the air is filled with smog the water is polluted and our parks are desolate because we didnt do the right planning
3986881 for many years people looked at us as a bedroom community but were continuing to build and improve
3986882 weve evolved into a community of great diversity a place where people can afford to bring their families
3986883 i think the cost is justified to bring some pride to our community
3986884 its been a chronic problem weve had investigators in and out of the facility for quite some time
3986885 the important thing here is everybody is held to the law with regard to the treatment of animals
3986886 we remember being told by lowes that they would be a good partnership and that they wouldnt be an eyesore or cause any kind of problem
3986887 they were going to go over and above to meet our needs
3986888 there are several trees that need to be replaced from the original installation throughout the site
3986889 the contractor is aware and will be replacing this material this fall under better planting conditions
3986890 for far too long the celtic board has faced a non stop barrage of ill considered criticism from uninformed people of dubious motivation
3986891 our goal has always been simple giving the very best to the most faithful fans in the world we promised that they would be told of our plans first and we are now delivering on that promise there will be further announcements as the plan develops in stages with planning permission and funding of the scheme the main areas in which we have to progress
3986892 2000 jobs and 78m what the new stadium will give glasgow
3986893 big money backers are waiting in the wings to turn celtics stadium dream into reality but they will remain in the background until a decision is taken on the council planning application
3986894 best brains in the business captains of industry back stadium switch
3986895 if its still as promising as it is now well go on to phase two in 2009
3986896 i am satisfied i wont be staying up all night worrying about buses
3986897 students wont be on the bus for 50 minutes or an hour this year
3986898 we are starting out with a great bank of drivers
3986899 some of its educational some of it is to truly help kids understand what theater and arts are about
3986900 some people aspire to be something else but she cherished being a mother
3986901 she was truly an awesome person i was always totally amazed by her humanity and grace
3986902 she was a matriarch of so many things in st charles the school delnor community hospital and the city
3986903 she was able to further the community to be generous to the community and at the same time she was modest and caring
3986904 indicators that were meeting our goal of creating lifelong learners
3986905 at the heart of it whats most important is the kind of experiences students have in the classroom
3986906 these scores reflect a work ethic of students who are encouraged to do their best and strive for excellence
3986907 while we are certainly most proud of our students accomplishments
3986908 we recognize that this achievement has been a collaborative effort involving talented and hard working students outstanding and dedicated teachers and supportive and encouraging parents
3986909 we budgeted for higher costs but we havent budgeted for this level of increase
3986910 our members have said this is one of the more difficult seasons they can remember
3986911 we use a lot of gas not only on our properties but also prospecting
3986912 were still losing money on the gas but it helps out a bit
3986913 for the most part people have been pretty understanding about it they understand that were pretty heavy users of gas
3986914 its our philosophy to offer really fair affordable and competitive prices
3986915 thats always been important to us but its even more important now
3986916 my gut says to keep it tight watch your costs and do good work
3986917 its amazing the amount of families that come through with their kids and buy stuff for their kids that they couldnt get at christmas
3986918 we started out by helping pads in wheaton and grew to the six organizations we help now
3986919 its the families the little children that are put out on the street thats the thing that bothers me the most
3986920 im inspired every time i go by a church in the morning and i see people stumbling out of it because they spent the night there
3986921 its unbelievable that in this day and age we still have people who are homeless
3986922 the problem with homelessness is that you cant get out of it its almost like a catch 22
3986923 we made more money in the rain there last year than we did the previous year
3986924 karl was a truly unique individual who willingly shared with me his knowledge of the chicago dental society and provided counsel and guidance whenever needed
3986925 his great humor storytelling and ability to send me to the thesaurus will always be remembered and cherished
3986926 yes i know it is quite a project right now but it is starting to come together now
3986927 this year was a huge step in the growth process that weve had because were reaching out to so many different age groups and ethnic groups
3986928 the addition of gospelfest is really a great event to add this year because of the interest in the performers and bands that will be taking part on the main stage
3986929 before it was very easy but these days you sometimes spend the whole day and you will only catch five fish
3986930 im ver disappointed by the misinformation in the western media about the conflict the experts i assume russian say that such misinformation is in the interest of the republican candidate for the presidency
3986931 as for the way the western mass media covers the conflict its the usual story as the western media usually covers events in russia not objectively but from one point of view this is because a strong russia is not in the interests of the west
3986932 some yeminis would do anything to get out of here
3986933 i guess they were going nuts when they saw me warming up and at least having a chance to come in the game
3986934 and after the game they were so excited and i was so glad they were here to see it
3986935 you get that first hit out of the way i was lucky enough to get it on my first at bat we won the ballgame
3986936 i woke up a few times but im feeling all right
3986937 i like those kids that fight all the way through the minor league system and he did he deserves a shot
3986938 im going to go out and hustle and put some good at bats together play some defense hopefully i can make some sort of positive influence on the team
3986939 i like the way he does stuff hell get a shot
3986940 i didnt want to make the white sox think i was just holding out for more money it was one of those things where personally i would feel a lot better taking what i did and kind of building a good relationship with them
3986941 i hope i get to that level i think i can thats obviously a great compliment from a guy who has been around a long time
3986942 i think everybody is different everybody plays the game a different way i play it my way i would like to lead the white sox one day the way derek jeter leads the yankees that would be the kind of leadership role i would like to take
3986943 if carrasco starts today then we lose him for four or five days
3986944 especially with scott linebrink not here i think its important that the seventh and eighth innings before we get to bobby jenks to have those guys ready
3986945 nothing has changed for me personally i feel good whether it would have been in relief tomorrow or starting
3986946 why is such and such your number 3 and i am not
3986947 if you had time to be on myspace you had time to cook clean iron wash dishes etc
3986948 bob where you been weve been looking everywhere for you we were getting worried we thought that cannibalistic cat with the 6 toes got to you
3986949 dude i have no idea where i was all i can tell you is that there was wonderful music something called
3986950 thats the funny thing i didnt i dont have a clue how i got back out here one minute im chillin on this awesome suede bed enjoying this nice relaxation cd humming to myself next thing i know i hit the cement
3986951 i think there are only three things that could help me right now a cute fuzzy gray kitten a cute boy who wants to make out all the time and is all mine and a pinball machine thats it
3986952 you gotta stop that youre gonna make me fall in love with you
3986953 on broadway also was appearing on the show that night the negatives weede snapped were relegated to a garage until his son found them in
3986954 i cant understand this whos discussing this youre discussing this
3986955 this should just be about sports without any of that other noise
3986956 supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3986957 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3986958 we feel bad but there is too much talk about it we are a very multicultural country in spain we are for sure going to apologize
3986959 it takes a team effort to defend against a great center like yao
3986960 right now were just out there practicing trying to get a feel for one another and get a little chemistry going in this offense
3986961 he had some opportunities to catch one or two vs the chiefs and it didnt happen each and every guy is continuing to audition and this is an important game in seattle on saturday against the seahawks for all of them but we know marty hes a veteran guy hes had some good practices here this week and im looking forward to him having a good game
3986962 he gives us leadership ability and hes a guy whos been there before a guy that the younger guys can look up to because hes been through the wars
3986963 im extremely happy that hes here he shows that he still has a great deal of play making ability still right now hes in the process of grasping the whole offense like the majority of the guys are
3986964 after this game we ought to be able to start honing in a little bit
3986965 its just like i was on a vacation for a little bit
3986966 i didnt forget how to get here to olivet nazarene university i didnt forget how to get to halas hall its not like i forgot how to get to the stadium or anything like that nothing was lost everything was still fresh in my mind
3986967 how could you forget anything like that it was a shock lovie smith and g m jerry angelo come into my hotel room to tell me what was going on i never would have expected it right before a preseason game like that it was just a sour moment at that point and then the next thing you know i was on a plane headed to miami trying to adjust down there it was tough at first but you just have to roll with it
3986968 greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool saying
3986969 obviously it doesnt top the relay from the other night
3986970 the greater than sign is inverted with the less than sign therefore a gt b means a is less than b
3986971 if the greater than sign is inverted with the less than sign then a gt b is no longer true rather a lt b is inverting the operator without inverting the operands does not refute the original expression
3986972 touch sight is a revolutionary digital camera designed for visually impaired people simple features make it easy to use including a unique feature which records sound for three seconds after pressing the shutter button the user can then use the sound as reference when reviewing and managing the photos touch sight does not have an lcd but instead has a lightweight flexible braille display sheet which displays a 3d image by embossing the surface allowing the user to touch their photo the sound file and picture document combine to become a touchable photo that is saved in the device and can be uploaded to share with others and downloaded to other touch sight cameras
3986973 have any of you read some of the m4ms in the missed connections geeze
3986974 do us straights have to worry what the fuck were gonna find around the next corner
3986975 marked by secrecy chicanery and deception not honest and aboveboard
3986976 what consumers want is to be able to find information faster and they want clues to help them find their way to that information faster
3986977 what were doing is quite unique and nobody can do what were doing
3986978 we believe were one of the top three or four alternative search engines in the marketplace
3986979 youre going to see more and more search engines become part of other applications so we think that this application will be particularly well suited for when youre looking for people or companies or entities of any nature
3986980 the reason why people wanted to develop semantic web search engines is because its a more real way of finding stuff
3986981 keeping in mind that the content is growing faster search engines need to be more effective at reflecting the thinking of real people
3986982 some people think that the behaviour of how people express their information needs has been established by google so even though they dont express it in natural language they do use just a couple of words
3986983 can that behaviour be untrained if they could express things more completely in a full sentence or in a question thats to be determined google just has so much market share right now
3986984 police are following all leads and trying to figure it out it could quite possibly be random
3986985 the driver lost control and struck the left concrete median
3986986 this was three in one day we havent had this many in one day in a while a couple of years ago we had five in one day
3986987 they got into a verbal altercation over alcohol she starting stabbing him in the neck face and chest
3986988 the victim yelled for help she continued to stab him
3986989 she called out of the car saying she just killed anderson and that someone should just get him she started drinking a beer
3986990 every time she got to drinking she acted like a damn fool
3986991 he was a very very nice quiet man very nice and very respectful
3986992 he was cool it was tragic he had to die like that
3986993 we are ahead of our business plan in terms of the numbers we said we would deliver to advertisers
3986994 there is a tremendous appetite for big event television of which the olympics is the biggest
3986995 our ratings for athens were up over sydney and sports in general seems immune to erosion in viewership and keeps bucking the trend a great example of that are some of the recent events on nbc like the stanley cup final wimbledon and u s open which all showed ratings increases
3986996 its an ongoing problem in the neighborhood with punks who want to be gang bangers
3986997 the problem is that western is the dividing line between two districts
3986998 if there are more problems residents need to call 911 so we can have the right resources there
3986999 if no one is calling its difficult to allocate resources
3987000 im gonna get my gun and kill that son of a bitch
3987001 anybody else would have just gone to the pet store
3987002 su pa s no intervendr en el proceso electoral salvadore o
3987003 trincheras de ideas valen m s que trincheras de piedras
3987004 some colleges recruited me as quarterback others a skills player
3987005 but i wanted to play whatever position i felt would get on the field the fastest while helping the team the most
3987006 playing football in college was always a goal but i wasnt just looking into idaho state
3987007 but when they got the new coaching staff i went down and visited during my senior year and liked what i saw i really respected what zamberlin had going
3987008 but i just kept learning from coach drew miller and took everything in
3987009 i have just been picking up on a lot of the stuff and being around a guy like eddie thompson really helps he has been a great role model
3987010 i just have to keep the chains moving block and do whatever else i have to do to help us im really looking forward to getting out there
3987011 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3987012 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3987013 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3987014 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3987015 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3987016 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3987017 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3987018 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3987019 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3987020 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3987021 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3987022 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3987023 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3987024 but mark what is the difference between pop and imap

3987030 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3987031 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3987032 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3987033 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3987034 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3987035 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3987036 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3987037 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3987038 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3987039 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3987040 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3987041 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3987042 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3987043 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3987044 while no definitive agreement has yet been signed or reached in connection with the discussions a voluntary preliminary filing has been made

3987049 were asking for the publics help because as well as the cost to business its the public who are affected by disruptions to services when people steal copper in this manner
3987050 there are arrangements through the organisation austrac to follow money trails once you know what the money is being used for
3987051 i dont think we need legislation we just need authorities to pay attention and in particular we need the public to help the police identify theft at the time when its actually taking place
3987052 im very pleased that finally justice has been done mainly for my soldiers because it was them who actually fought face to face with the enemy
3987053 they fought over and above what would be expected of young national service soldiers with very little experience
3987054 they repelled wave after wave of assaulting suicidal attacks and not one of the enemy got inside our position thanks to them
3987055 it was just sad that we lost 18 soldiers that day
3987056 its good to see a situation where we are now getting some justice with respect to these long standing issues
3987057 every single one of the men who were involved in this contact and battle have the right to be very proud today
3987058 if the senate does conduct an additional review it is essential its terms of reference are broad ranging to achieve real outcomes for indigenous australians
3987059 we have to take the politics out of this debate
3987060 in order to achieve a lasting impact a review by the senate would need to consider historical funding arrangements for indigenous services since 1978
3987061 it would need to assess the backlog in health education housing and infrastructure and determine whether commonwealth funding support is adequate
3987062 we will have to be a lot better in the second leg at anfield much better

3987066 there is absolutely no way that i am trying to or will be involved in any process to cover anything up
3987067 i want to make sure that everything that happens is revealed in an objective way and that recommendations that come from this inquiry by nopsa are acted upon
3987068 i also give another commitment if it is deemed necessary at the end of this process that there be a broader inquiry even a royal commission then we will have one
3987069 but first of all lets allow this inquiry to take its course its obviously producing some interesting information about the nature of the inspection regime and the issues that flow from that
3987070 i cant stop them from doing that but i think the general public can see pretty much what the objective is
3987071 let the inquiry take its course before people rush to judgment

3987089 it should come as no surprise that the u s economic malaise is now becoming a global phenomenon
3987090 after dodging the u s slowdown last year the 15 nation eurozone economy appears to have shrunk in q2 for the first time since the common currencys introduction in 1999 firm figures are still coming in but italys gdp contracted by 0 3 in q2 after growing by a scant 0 5 in q1 and germany the largest eurozone economy and the engine of g7 growth in recent years contracted sharply in the second quarter shrinking by as much as 1 5 according the wall street journal europe eurozone growth certainly slowed to a crawl in the first quarter according to rge monitor q1 growth in the uk fell to 0 4 ireland to 0 8 italy to 0 5 and spain to 0 4 estonia and latvia contracted sharply while q1 gdp growth in canada fell to 0 3 and new zealand shrank by 0 3 as in the u s housing booms in spain portugal and ireland are collapsing while the euros recent appreciation hurt companies that export japan too is at risk of a recession as exports fell in june for the first time since 2003 and unemployment reached 4 1 percent almost a two year high

3987199 for him to come and visit and show his respects is really important to us
3987200 my fathers a world war ii vet so its very important to me anyway that theyre remembered and honored
3987201 itll leave a lasting impression on the active the reservists the guard the retirees and then the veterans as well
3987202 i think it will work out well for him because a lot of people dont know much about him about his military background
3987203 you havent heard that much from him in that area so thats important that hell be able to make the decisions to be able to protect americans
3987204 im mindful of the fact that our military installations here in hawaii are so important theyre important to our national security theyre also important to the economy of hawaii
3987205 they come here and they see the beauty thats at punchbowl national cemetery and they take this and they take it back with them and it never goes away
3987206 this will be a lasting memory as you walk out of these sacred grounds
3987207 it is a network of computers that the students will be able to use to better their education performance educational enrichment program and some games
3987208 we are i would venture to say one good heat wave away
3987209 you want to be outside its beautiful but its really not the place to be especially if youre doing strenuous exercise

3987215 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
3987216 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
3987217 there is no one word i can say that sums up her performance
3987218 in one year she has made the greatest improvement of any athlete male or female in the history of st kitts amp nevis

3987220 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
3987221 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
3987222 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
3987223 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
3987224 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do

3987230 an excessive and unsustainable growth for the caledon east community
3987231 once it is done and crime moves in we cannot reverse it
3987232 i fully believe were making a great big mistake here
3987233 i think its a pie in the sky idea that professionals would want to live there
3987234 has all the potential of depreciating the quality of life for those people who are already here
3987235 i dont think you guys can help us very much
3987236 i dont think theres much here for the residents of caledon
3987237 the fastest growing segment 25 1 cagr of the t amp m industry over the next several years will be pxi based systems according to research by madhan dhandayutham a senior research analyst at frost amp sullivan
3987238 cabinet will look at what further measures will be possible to reduce the pressure on a system
3987239 there is much much more to be done and we are working hard on this
3987240 the core reason for the pressure on the system being we are in the middle of an appallingly low level of rainfall and i cant make it rain

3987251 were sputtering offensively and with johns struggles we arent getting production there bochy said of bowker who was hitting
3987252 we need some more offense and thats why theyre here
3987253 it might have been for him but thats the art of our business hes struggling and you cant deny a kid ishikawa with a combined 24 home runs and 94 rbis
3987254 we dont want to overexpose anybody here especially a guy who hardly
3987255 they gave me a chance to come up and help the team and i felt i did that for awhile bowker said
3987256 those first couple weeks i was just in a hot zone
3987257 but i was getting myself out swinging at pitches i shouldnt be ill get out of it i know i will
3987258 what was going on there i cant even describe it i dont even know what i was doing
3987259 there were a few nibbles on him before the july 31 non waiver deadline interest in infielder rich aurilia remains nonexistent sabean said

3987263 the cheapest car to run is the car you already own
3987264 id like to explain how a dashingly youthful 59 year old came to be driving a geezermobile in the first place
3987265 fords panther line of cars which consists of the crown victoria lincoln town car and grand marquis is designed with the fuel tank located outside the protection of the rear axle and within the cars
3987266 similar but similar enough that they could probably slip this into a cable re airing of
3987267 a novel that since its publication in 1932 has probably been read by only two people namely james wood and joseph roth
3987268 to start it place the transmission shift lever in the
3987269 yeah i know it sounds crazy but i think we can make it work
3987270 drive ahead of my actual position because only the brakes worked immediately
3987271 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
3987272 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
3987273 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir
3987274 probably means hes got it drafted and ready to go
3987275 this is the most relaxed ive seen you all week
3987276 this is a great start to becoming a certified golf club
3987277 with the program we are trying to reduce chemical use such as pesticide
3987278 we are working together with the golfers through a line of communication
3987279 we have put information on the web site so golfers know what we are doing
3987280 we expect in the next couple of years that audubon will be happy with us
3987281 when you leave your house door unlocked when you go out or leave your car unlocked overnight is like waving a flag in the air which reads please steal from me
3987282 with fewer cops patrolling our streets a lot more can happen we had an incident relating to assault where a cab driver was hit it took the police over an hour and a half to get to inglewood
3987283 its not that were not there or not doing our job its because we sometimes have other cases we have to look into
3987284 the police need the help of true dedicated residents who are proud of their community and will stand up for it
3987285 they need people who will assist them in their investigations so if you see a crime being committed take down the details
3987286 im happy to see that young people are interested in our online casinos studies
3987287 the internet has piqued the interest of our youth and has given them unparalled access to all knowledge academic and secular
3987288 the highest usage areas in our library now are the public computers with internet access although most of the time the crowd is younger and usually communicating with friends some older notable online casinos researchers will come in and go straight for internet completely ignoring the card catalog
3987289 i first read it online and was turned on that i went out and bought the book now im a true fan of online casinos studies and research i find the subject to be extremely interesting and thought provoking and reminiscent of the free thought era in the late 60s and early 70s
3987290 i like the internet because it is very transparent and available to all
3987291 but at the same time there is no authoritave body that can assign some sort of approval rating to truly legitimate works and those spun by unqualified authors
3987292 when i published my work it would take a couple years to circulate the academic community and public now with the internet i can write and publish instantly casual readers and researchers alike can review my work as i write it
3987293 without the awesome online casinos studies of schemmel vitello this area would never have reached popular society now we can truly dig out the truths and realities of the online casinos world around us and develop more reliable and sound conclusions thousands of heads are better than a few
3987294 this is all in the same category as all the other bills that are designed to protect you from yourself
3987295 this is a great example of how local businesses and municipalities are motivated to work together to find innovative and collaborative methods to meet future energy needs
3987296 this type of initiative sends a positive message that we can all make a difference by doing our part to conserve energy in small and large ways
3987297 as the first of its kind in canada this solar project was an ideal opportunity for enersource and the region to demonstrate leadership
3987298 our goal in contributing half of the investment in this project was two fold these solar flairs will not only produce clean energy but they will serve as an attraction that we hope will inspire the public to study renewable energy alternatives along with conservation strategies to ultimately reduce their carbon footprint
3987299 this project signals the beginning of many clean energy initiatives on the horizon
3987300 through investments in renewable clean energy technology and community partnerships with energy conservation conscious organizations such as enersource the region is demonstrating an active commitment to doing our part for the environment
3987301 its a lovely area and it has a lot to offer
3987302 its a fun evening people get to shop around and reacquaint with neighbours
3987303 the festival will end around midnight the streets will be reopen again to the towns discretion by 1 30 a m
3987304 as well there will be a wall where the children will write a note to the troops in afghanistan and it will be send overseas to them
3987305 william osler health centre has the most up todate facilities and state ofthe art technology excellent medical staff and a welcoming multicultural community
3987306 the residents will not only have a wonderful twoyear residency training experience but they may well be enticed to subsequently practice in the community
3987307 residents will receive a combination of educational opportunities ranging from traditional classroom training from osler affiliated physicians to practical experience working alongside our community family physicians
3987308 a significant proportion of all medical residents choose to stay in the communities in which they trained
3987309 this is one way osler can give back to our community and help address the family physician shortage in the area now and in the future
3987310 this initiative will provide the opportunity to increase our primary care capacity for our community throughout the central west lhin
3987311 this is a prime example of how integration partnerships will benefit us all and strengthens our health care system
3987312 i congratulate william osler health centre on this achievement this is exciting news for the future health of our community
3987313 this initiative creates a great opportunity to attract young talented medical professionals to our beautiful city and will ultimately improve our access to skilled family physicians
3987314 etobicoke general hospitals new role as a specialized training ground for family medicine residents is very exciting
3987315 it is testament to the unique capabilities knowledge and expertise that etobicoke medical staff bring to our diverse community
3987316 i was putting the ball where i wanted it and orillia was swinging so it worked out well
3987317 but overall i think our energy level was higher which made us more prepared as a team and our defence stepped it up when we needed them to
3987318 our goal will be for our offence to get going for the next game
3987319 we have to counter their tight zone were sitting too far outside and thats killing us so we have to cut pick and cycle a little more than usual
3987320 eventually forgiveness cannot be accessed simply because you want to forgive the essence of forgiveness is transcendent it lies in a domain of consciousness where the wound doesnt exist and the wrong never occurred whenever we forgive our children and other loved ones we do so by transcending the normal responses of blame and judgment to find a larger sense of forgiveness you have to undertake a journey that leads to this transcendent place inside yourself sadly few people begin the journey with enough knowledge and guidance to arrive at the goal as edwards will discover its an unforgiving world but one must be deeply grateful that transcendent forgiveness is real after all the day may come when we need it ourselves for our own transgressions
3987321 the slow adoption of vista among businesses and budget conscious cios coupled with the proven success of a new type of microsoft free pc provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for linux
3987322 the slow take up of vista has resulted in the extension of xps life with microsoft selling it half price to pc makers microsoft does not have a great product in vista but it will not be muscled out
3987323 it has such dominance that even the linux pc makers have no intention of overtaking microsoft they just want a little bit of market share
3987324 we know there will be no more money for local government nor any prospect of it
3987325 it is now about what we can generate ourselves for example the corporate service transformation cst element of our business transformation project has delivered savings equivalent to a three per cent increase in council tax we think there will be a monumental shift in the way services are delivered over the next few years
3987326 in many transformation projects no one has been prepared to stay around long enough to see it through i have given it that stability in any organisation you have to have a champion to push projects through even when things get rough
3987327 those already using open source are probably the most technologically self sufficient theyre not going to pay to give up their autonomy
3987328 why would i go to a firm to buy what i can get off the web free without the associated overhead of dealing with a large organisation possibly because there is support quality assurance and training provided by the becta framework supplier for example
3987329 in practice even the implementation of bsf varies so there is probably scope to use open source outside the bsf offer
3987330 if schools want open source at the moment they must go outside the framework
3987331 although web 2 0 is entering the trough of disillusionment it will emerge within two years to have transformational impact as companies steadily gain more experience and success with both the technologies and the cultural implications
3987332 later in between two and five years cloud computing and service oriented architecture will deliver transformation by driving deep changes in the role and capabilities of it
3987333 many types of technology providers are aligning themselves with this trend with the result that confusion and hype will continue for at least another year before distinct submarkets and market leaders emerge
3987334 other technologies that have begun to be interesting to business include 3d printing surface computing augmented reality and mobile robots
3987335 we expect early adopters to start applying these in novel ways and driving new classes of applications
3987336 this is the heart of our enemy he is determined to hinder and harm and ruin to steal and kill and destroy so let me say this again the story of our life is the story of the long and brutal assault on your heart by the one who knows what ok a show of hands who among us is certain that today you are adequately bearing the image of god for all to see anyone no a little maybe on a good day sometimes
3987337 nadie va a poder conmigo es imposible que vuelvan a hacerme da o
3987338 hago hueco como sea porque necesito escaparme a la isla si no lo hago es como si el verano no existiera
3987339 hasta que mi cerebro ya no pueda memorizar un texto
3987340 francamente a mi edad no estoy como para acostarme con ning n se or
3987341 no pretendo afrontar papeles que no me correspondan por edad adem s ahora venden las caras guapas y j venes y hay que saber aceptarlo aunque si es cierto que los personajes de mujeres mayores se los dan siempre a carmen maura o a meryl streep lo mismo tendr a que acabar con ellas
3987342 de hecho si tuviera que volver a empezar no me importar a ir a la plaza con la pandereta cantar y pasar la gorra nunca me he conformado con un no
3987343 imagina que a mi edad me llaman de los ngeles ser a algo incre ble no creo que me nominen para los oscar pero al menos se me ver en los estados unidos
3987344 afortunadamente no me ha dado por matar a mi ex marido en la serie ya ha asesinado a dos
3987345 no me creo que la gente no lo sea yo no soy conformista yo siempre quiero m s ser la mejor tener dinero salud trabajo
3987346 he amado durante treinta a os a paco mars y francamente a mi edad no me veo como para acostarme con otro hombre ahora estoy en un buen momento personal por fin he aprendido a dormir sola aunque sigo teniendo muchos miedos y complejos en general me siento estupenda
3987347 ayer mismo paco en formentera se puso de rodillas ante cecilia y le pidi en matrimonio fue bonito
3987348 intentar atemperar las necesidades de la defensa con las leg timas aspiraciones personales y familiares de los que sirven en esta comandancia
3987349 querr a tambi n que el balance de nuestras relaciones con la sociedad que tan generosamente nos acoge y de la que queremos ser miembros de pleno derecho sea positivo como forma de agradecer esa misma generosidad
3987350 querr a que sigui ramos mereciendo la confianza que el ej rcito de tierra ha puesto en los hombres y mujeres de esta guarnici n al tiempo que mientras lo hacemos continuemos honrando el nombre de estas islas en aquellos escenarios donde se materialice la vocaci n de espa a como exportadora de paz y estabilidad tal como fue explicado en el pre mbulo de la constituci n
3987351 para cuando llega esta documentaci n al consell ya est hecha la obra
3987352 no podemos hacer lo que la gente cree que podemos hacer ir a visitar obras y pararlas
3987353 despu s de las lluvias el gobierno realiz una siembra directa de semillas de algarrobo han pasado 10 a os y a pesar que a n son peque os los taladores optan por cortarlos sin darse cuenta del da o que ocasionan al ecosistema
3987354 la le a tambi n es utilizada en las f bricas de yeso ubicadas en la jurisdicci n de m rrope a lo largo de la panamericana norte
3987355 la inversi n es buena porque genera fuentes de trabajo y es una oportunidad de desarrollo para la comunidad pero tambi n es indispensable respetar el bosque la ampliaci n de la frontera agr cola significar talar miles de hect reas de rboles
3987356 the lost sea started as my own solo acoustic project
3987357 it felt boring to play like the songs were empty so i wanted to expand the sound and make it more dynamic
3987358 i was listening to the promise ring and pedro the lion all that stuff on jade tree records and also older guys like tom petty and johnny cash
3987359 my friends told me i should go see how people feel about the songs and start hitting up open mics acousticafe is a supportive environment where everyone wants to get better you can go up to someone like brad yoder who has played acoustic for a while everyone there has been really great and helped me out a lot
3987360 he had seen us live and a few weeks later i mentioned to him that we were working on an ep recorded with jake hanner of the band donora he jumped right on it and asked if we wanted to put it out on atomic family i really respect what hes doing trying to bring the scene together its amazing how they started a label out of basement recordings in his house they had their own booth for three dates on the warped tour its impressive that hes working so hard
3987361 we are playing shows with some of those bands and we definitely fit in with their sound
3987362 son bastantes los clientes que al llegar a los establecimientos hoteleros de nuestra zona est n atemorizados ya que algunos taxistas o conductores de transfers les realizan comentarios muy negativos sobre la zona
3987363 peor zona de mallorca que no hay casi espa oles que hay poca seguridad mucho ruido suciedad incluso algunos llegan a aconsejarles que hablen con la agencia para un cambio de zona
3987364 todo ello ocasiona que los clientes lleguen descontentos al hotel y que sea dif cil fidelizarlos de cara a un futuro
3987365 por el bien de todos del turismo y por ende de nuestra isla
3987366 es una inversi n muy importante y se estudia de qu forma se tiene que adquirir c mo se ha de pagar y c mo se debe hacer sostenible en el tiempo
3987367 hay que tener en cuenta que estos barcos requieren unas condiciones mucho m s especiales que los tp 52 o irc muchos podr an hundirse con un golpe de mar
3987368 para nosotros es un d a especial ya que supone el estreno de este barco en competici n tras tres a os de restauraci n estamos impacientes en saber c mo responde en plena competici n
3987369 esto no ha terminado cualquier cosa puede suceder en las tres pr ximas pruebas no soy invencible nadie es invencible y cualquiera puede ganar
3987370 ser el competidor ol mpico m s galardonado de todos los tiempos ahora suena extra o decirlo no tengo absolutamente nada para decir me qued sin palabras
3987371 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
3987372 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
3987373 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
3987374 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
3987375 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
3987376 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
3987377 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
3987378 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
3987379 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
3987380 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
3987381 i wish someone would objectify me they all think im asexual
3987382 a nightmare is much more intense than a bad dream it can arouse feelings of fear horror and distress it replicates our deepest fears and can reflect the different types of stresses we face in our waking world
3987383 nightmarish thoughts such as losing your job being homeless falling and being chased are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3987384 for example dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life the attacker or falling in the dream represents the emotion of fear and anxiety
3987385 its no wonder gordon brown and alistair darling are making a special appearance in our nightmares at the moment both symbolise the fears we are facing in todays economy
3987386 the things that people say that upset us the most are things that we have issues with
3987387 the city is facing an extremely challenging budget for the remainder of the year and it affects the staff in the city
3987388 we are looking into how best we can serve the neighborhoods given these tough economic times
3987389 from what i gathered bill schottenstein feels that the freeway will negate a lot of the sound
3987390 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
3987391 beginning on thursday the citys police will resume their work
3987392 for another two days russian troops will remain in the gori region to transfer control to georgian police and then they will leave
3987393 we still have diplomatic relations with georgia we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia
3987394 but we wont directly talk to saakashvili we wont do that we offered him peace but not friendship
3987395 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the us europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3987396 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict
3987397 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3987398 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
3987399 on our side as a party we have no problems on that aspect
3987400 committed to reaching an agreement that upholds the will of the people
3987401 we knew negotiations would be difficult but a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
3987402 we are committed to a solution that recognises that the people spoke on the 29th of march 2008
3987403 theres a lot to be excited about so we cant get rid of all of their nervousness we want to acclimate them to the rules and regulations to decrease some of the shock
3987404 we wanted to encourage them to look at the big picture
3987405 what you do your freshman year really counts colleges want well rounded students that show participation in extracurricular activities and community involvement
3987406 at the orientation i got to see some of my friends again and i met some of my teachers too
3987407 im most nervous about my grades but im excited about playing sports
3987408 i started enrollment services with a goal of a more serious program for vets
3987409 its a need for the population and in my mind its a special population
3987410 to fill that void we took what we already had which deals with a lot of the administration of the gi bill and were trying to provide more remedial programs which we had with veterans upward bound and more of a community
3987411 these are things that you dont normally use in the military on a day to day basis
3987412 its very difficult its a completely different experience to be a civilian and also to be a student
3987413 self management is not something you get to do all that much
3987414 youre not really feeling like you are a part of the community even though you want to be
3987415 even 10 years ago for most companies the notion of a criminal taking something from the business was probably some local thug or crime ring breaking down the door and stealing something
3987416 now basically almost any business of any significant size once theyve got a web site and e mail is opened to the world of cybercrime and cybercriminals are a lot different theyre younger theyre sophisticated theyre most likely from a foreign country they can hide themselves not only using internet technology but using their jurisdiction for example if theyre from some eastern bloc country its very hard to prosecute
3987417 as far as im aware theres not another company in the world thats offering a subscription service like ours
3987418 really it boils down to keeping the organization up to date with the most likely threats to the corporation
3987419 hell do this every day for 22 days a day for each person killed

3987434 i was not thinking about winning two gold medals at two consecutive olympics
3987435 that was never my goal i was just focused on doing my best in beijing
3987436 the growing redirection of olympic gold medals is because the old disparities between competitive sports levels due to historical and economic causes is being constantly overturned
3987437 this also means the traditional sporting powers face stronger and stronger challengers
3987438 what is important is to show china and to show beijing to the whole world
3987439 several months ago everyone was talking about tibet but foreigners need to know the truth about china and we believe that through the olympic games the world will know the truth
3987440 todd the governors husband and sarah are scratching their heads you know why on earth why is this guy still representing the department hes a horrible recruiting tool and from their perspective everybodys protecting him
3987441 im telling you honestly you know she really likes walt a lot but on this issue she doesnt know why there is absolutely no action for a year on this issue its very very troubling to her and the family
3987442 i had given high praise to the red wines at shaw vineyard when the new winery opened last summer little did i know that owner steve shaw and winemaker morten hallgren who is also owner of ravines wine cellars on keuka lake were also working on a line of white wines
3987443 i visited shaw vineyards last weekend as they unveiled these new whites and they are very impressive dont let the slightly disheveled look of the winerys finishing touches being completed keep you away because when you get past the rough exterior inside you will find truly inspired wines
3987444 shaw vineyard was established in 1980 when my father planted chardonnay amp cabernet sauvignon on the east side of keuka lake additional vineyards in penn yan ny amp himrod ny were purchased in the mid 1990s we currently have 55 acres under vine between keuka amp seneca lake
3987445 ive been in the wine amp spirits industry for 20 yrs now and my father 30 years he has been a grape grower for the following wineries for decades herman j weimer dr frank glenora and canandaigua wine co
3987446 my father met morten when morten was a winemaker at dr frank when my father was selling his grapes to dr frank morten recognized the quality of my fathers grapes and a relationship was established from there
3987447 libella is a second label for shaw a second label establishes its own brand identity the shaw vineyard label to me is a very refined and mature label for an experienced wine drinker my goal with libella is for a relaxed yet high quality pinot grigio that appeals to premium as well as novice wine consumers the dragonfly on the label is meant to attract people based on the design the pinot grigio has a refreshing summery feel in my opinion
3987448 to be recognized as a premium finger lakes wine producer amp be included in the prestigious ranks with dr frank and herman weimer
3987449 as close as possible to an estate winery but its likely that grapes will come from outside we know several great growers and we are trying to establish long term grower contracts just like the more established wineries
3987450 our worldwide presence means we are already able to compensate for fluctuating business cycles in individual markets
3987451 the growing worldwide shortage of raw materials and the resulting energy problems are actually a big opportunity for us that is precisely the target area of our resources segment we can help to exploit reserves of raw materials thanks to our new deep level drilling rigs and specialized knowledge in operations for deep mines and we can profit from the investment backlog for infrastructure projects such as the construction of power stations
3987452 durch unsere weltweite pr senz sind wir schon heute in der lage konjunkturelle schwankungen in einzelnen m rkten auszugleichen
3987453 chancen ergeben sich f r uns nicht zuletzt aus der weltweiten verknappung der rohstoffe und der daraus resultierenden energieprobleme genau darauf haben wir das segment resources ausgerichtet mit neuen tiefbohrger ten und spezialkenntnissen bei bauleistungen f r tiefe bergwerke helfen wir rohstoffvorkommen zu erschlie en dar ber hinaus werden wir vom investitionsstau bei infrastrukturprojekten wie dem bau von kraftwerken profitieren
3987454 in an environment of bad news and growing uncertainty in terms of future economic development both in germany and abroad i consider these results to be extremely encouraging

3987458 it felt great to get in there in team i did some good things obviously ive got some rust on me ive just got to knock the rust off but im definitely happy with where im at every day i plan on getting better and better id love to play this week i want to be ready for next week but my ultimate goal is to be in midseason form by the time we get to indianapolis
3987459 thats what im looking to get out of this preseason game is healthy and not another long drive on the first possession so well see how that works
3987460 i just know you guys get fired up about that kind of stuff so i guess that was the right thing to say
3987461 i sang it the other night at a team meeting and they liked it so they wanted me to sing it again
3987462 youve got to do what the vets tell you to do youre a rookie its different you go from being a senior in college now youre back to square one but its a good thing

3987471 if the senate does conduct an additional review it is essential its terms of reference are broad ranging to achieve real outcomes for indigenous australians
3987472 we have to take the politics out of this debate
3987473 in order to achieve a lasting impact a review by the senate would need to consider historical funding arrangements for indigenous services since 1978
3987474 it would need to assess the backlog in health education housing and infrastructure and determine whether commonwealth funding support is adequate
3987475 im very pleased that finally justice has been done mainly for my soldiers because it was them who actually fought face to face with the enemy
3987476 they fought over and above what would be expected of young national service soldiers with very little experience
3987477 they repelled wave after wave of assaulting suicidal attacks and not one of the enemy got inside our position thanks to them
3987478 it was just sad that we lost 18 soldiers that day
3987479 its good to see a situation where we are now getting some justice with respect to these long standing issues
3987480 every single one of the men who were involved in this contact and battle have the right to be very proud today

3987484 someone said that there were tigers in the streets do you believe it
3987485 now two people have said that there are tigers in the streets do you believe it
3987486 now three people have said the same thing do you believe it
3987487 there are no tigers in the streets at all yet if three people say the same thing you believe it we must be alert against rumors gaining credence
3987488 there is absolutely no way that i am trying to or will be involved in any process to cover anything up
3987489 i want to make sure that everything that happens is revealed in an objective way and that recommendations that come from this inquiry by nopsa are acted upon
3987490 i also give another commitment if it is deemed necessary at the end of this process that there be a broader inquiry even a royal commission then we will have one
3987491 but first of all lets allow this inquiry to take its course its obviously producing some interesting information about the nature of the inspection regime and the issues that flow from that
3987492 i cant stop them from doing that but i think the general public can see pretty much what the objective is
3987493 were asking for the publics help because as well as the cost to business its the public who are affected by disruptions to services when people steal copper in this manner
3987494 there are arrangements through the organisation austrac to follow money trails once you know what the money is being used for
3987495 drug disasters are literally built into the current system of drug testing and approvals in the united states recent changes in the system have only increased the proportion of new drugs with serious risks
3987496 based on our current system the designation of safe and effective on todays new drugs could be replaced with apparently safe based on incomplete information and more effective than a placebo
3987497 as close as youll come to achieving the best of both worlds

3987505 the court asked him anwar to provide his dna to prove that he is innocent but why he rejected is there any problem this is because he is guilty and he seems very worried
3987506 he argued that the sample will not be obsolete but if you want to test whether you are suffering from diabetes would you use old sample or the latest one of course the latest one the fact is so simple and we should inform everyone regardless of race

3987521 so hell get this once a day you can either give it to him as part as your morning routine or at night
3987522 for the next four or five days just combine it with one of his other treatments once you finish that youll just do this one by itself
3987523 now this is a steroid but its a very low does steroid
3987524 i dont mean to be completely stupid but i have a few questions so is this like asthma does he have asthma
3987525 well yeah its a lot like asthma were doing this in hopes that it wont develop into asthma and most kids who get asthma grow out of it of course i cant guarantee anything
3987526 okay so is his brain being damaged if hes having to work so hard to breathe is his brain getting enough oxygen
3987527 his brain is getting plenty of oxygen just because his breathing is laboured doesnt mean hes not getting enough air human lungs can function at about 1 of their full capacity it just means that the lungs have to work a lot harder than normal which makes other things harder look at him we can hear that hes active hes moving but its harder than it should be we can tell by his breathing
3987528 and the steroids is his little face going to become all puffy
3987529 no hes not going to turn into arnold schwarzenegger or have baby roid rage or anything like that hes not going to look like a weightlifter or body builder or anything
3987530 well at least for the next two or three years definitely until july ive written you a 30 day prescription with one refill this is the maintenence medicine i said wed hold off on at the last visit its necessary now
3987531 okay so that should take us until the end of june were scheduled for a checkup then
3987532 great after july i might take him off of it if hes doing better ill take him off of it for the summer then start him back up in the fall when the weather starts to turn by doing this for the next few years we hope that his lungs will be able to work at full capacity later on

3987539 anuncia dos a os de reformas para combatir la crisis
3987540 admite ahora la gravedad de la crisis pero las medidas que propone no se aplicar n hasta 2009
3987541 dejando su credibilidad en la gesti n pol tica de la crisis
3987542 suponen una falta de respeto a los que padecen la crisis
3987543 todos los diputados socialistas saben que ha pesado m s en el voto ciudadano el liderazgo de zapatero que el de cualquier dirigente regional del psoe

3987550 son decisiones con las que el gobierno trata de recuperar el tiempo perdido a cuenta de su empe o en no reconocer la naturaleza del problema
3987551 no s lo ha provocado retrasos sino transmitido mensajes equ vocos en relaci n con las prioridades del momento
3987552 es necesario establecer prioridades y eso es lo que hasta el momento no ha habido a la espera de conocer en detalle las medidas se echa en falta un discurso pol tico realista que sustituya al triunfalista que se ha mantenido hasta casi ayer
3987553 lo m s preocupante sigue siendo la actitud del gobierno que contin a m s preocupado de ganar la batalla de la imagen que de acudir a la ra z del problema
3987554 zapatero escenific ayer la interrupci n de sus vacaciones para presidir la comisi n delegada para asuntos econ micos llevando bajo el brazo
3987555 propuestas viejas que a la hora de la verdad no tendr n una incidencia efectiva sobre la econom a
3987556 zapatero deber a saber a estas alturas que los problemas de la econom a no se resuelven con fuegos de artificio ni yendo a remolque de los acontecimientos
3987557 las cifras econ micas contin an sin dar un respiro a los espa oles
3987558 zapatero solbes y el equipo econ mico de moncloa siguen sin escarmentar se niegan a aprender las lecciones del pasado y contin an mostr ndose tan imprudentes como cuando hace ahora un a o el gobierno infravaloraba el calado de la crisis que se avecinaba con la ingenuidad propia de quien conf a su gesti n al buenismo y a la demagogia
3987559 pretender tranquilizar a la sociedad fingiendo dar una imagen de control de la situaci n no es realista ni eficaz porque el bolsillo no miente
3987560 la mejor muestra de que zapatero es consciente de su profunda crisis de credibilidad es el gesto de interrumpir
3987561 sin embargo la inacci n la pasividad no se pueden maquillar con meros impulsos aparentes o con rudimentarias operaciones de propaganda pol tica
3987562 el gobierno sigue sin combatir la crisis econ mica con eficacia y los ciudadanos lo saben
3987563 supone el reconocimiento impl cito del gobierno de que la situaci n econ mica es grave por primera vez desde que empez la crisis el presidente zapatero parece decidido a asumir la realidad y a hacerle frente
3987564 en la crisis econ mica espa ola al margen de problemas reales hay tambi n una dosis de desconfianza propiciada por un gobierno que ha intentado negar esa crisis hasta el ltimo momento hasta que los datos han sido dram ticamente contundentes
3987565 en la jornada de hoy por tanto el presidente zapatero tiene una oportunidad de oro para dar a la sociedad espa ola un mensaje que transmita confianza
3987566 de lo que se trata es de poner las bases para frenar la destrucci n de empleo y reanimar la actividad econ mica para aminorar en la medida de lo posible el impacto de la crisis
3987567 el gobierno deber a en estos momentos escuchar la llamada de acuerdo contra la crisis que le llega desde el pp la situaci n es lo suficientemente delicada como para llegar a acuerdos de estado que permitan afrontar con el m ximo de garant as posible los problemas derivados de la crisis si a ello unimos la debilidad pol tica derivada del conflicto de la financiaci n auton mica que condiciona el futuro econ mico del pa s est claro que el gobierno no debe actuar en solitario para lograr soluciones

3987573 la ue endurece su postura tras la respuesta de teher n a la ltima oferta negociadora

3987578 what potential and problems do you associate with the use of the internet in school education how might the maximum potential be achieved in this area
3987579 the social isolation and alienation that will come from the increasing amount of time they will spend in front of computer and tv screens the role of school will change to become more of a social and activity center where students learn social skills through participation in group activities
3987580 people are pretty dissatisfied with schools right now in part because the basic structure of american education hasnt changed in more than a century online education will be the catalyst
3987581 a lot of things can be made in china and other countries much cheaper thats a fact what is unknown though is quality of the product and quality is what it always boils down to in the end

3987604 we know now that the reason people are buying iphones is because they can personalize their experience the expectation was that the app store is what would differentiate the iphone and the numbers seem to bear that out
3987605 i really didnt know that i was going to write something that would be good enough to submit to the app store
3987606 i just thought i would write something i could put on my own phone and maybe put it on a few friends phones i totally did not expect the level of interest that it turns out that there is for doing crosswords on your phone
3987607 basically the first two weeks that the app was in the store i earned more than my entire graduate stipend

3987676 but then i said that doesnt make any sense because all those facilities are at wyatt

3987833 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3987834 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3987835 pa then something is wrong with your ears and not your phone lah
3987836 i was so calm i think i could have seen every face in this venue the medal in the 100m also made me more at ease
3987837 the hindus and the muslims belong to two different religions philosophies social customs and literature to yoke together two such nations under a single state one as a numerical minority and the other as a majority must lead to growing discontent and final destruction of any fabric that may be so built up for the government of such a state
3987838 india cannot be assumed today to be unitarian and homogeneous nation but on the contrary there are two nations in the main the hindus and the muslims
3987839 my whole soul rebels against the idea that hinduism and islam represent two antagonistic cultures and doctrines to assent to such a doctrine is for me a denial of god
3987840 the old man is dying of exhaustion the caravan has gone on
3987841 to demarcate the boundaries of the two parts of the punjab on the basis of ascertaining the contiguous majority areas of muslims and non muslims in doing so it will take into account other factors
3987842 divided two and two leaving sir cyril radcliffe the invidious task of making the actual decisions
3987843 with the tragic legacy of an uncertain future a young refugee sits on the walls of purana qila transformed into a vast refugee camp in delhi
3987844 the suggestion remains that british rule did not leave a substantial legacy of wealth health or happiness to the majority of the subjects of the commonwealth
3987845 about 0 9 1 3 of indian national income from 1868 to the 1930s
3987846 a great deal of government expenditure was in fact incurred for services that india needed but could not supply on her own
3987847 the prospect of devastating famines once every few years was inherent in indias ecology famines were primarily environmental in origin
3987848 legal framework which promoted private property rights and contract law more explicitly
3987849 at the lowest estimate half a million people perished and twelve million became homeless
3987850 i refuse to vote for a son of a bush
3987851 then 9 11 happened and i couldnt take it anymore
3987852 the response to 9 11 the right was saying this is pure evil were facing and the left was saying how are we at fault for this
3987853 when 9 11 happened i knew democrats wouldnt be strong enough to fight this war
3987854 i thought that the minute we started talking about politics that would be the end
3987855 there was this dance that we did a dance familiar to conservative actors in hollywood lots of actors have done it
3987856 its almost like people who are gay show up at the baths and say oh i didnt know you were gay
3987857 once they found out i was a republican unfortunately for some people it was a problem
3987858 so we very much cared about what the straight communities had to say about every photo and every message that we tested
3987859 we tried single people we tried couples by themselves none of those sorts of images worked as well as presenting people in the sense of family we also heard from people that they thought that gay people dont have families certainly thought they dont have children dont even think to ask about a significant other about theyre mother about their sister
3987860 the fact that there are still hate crimes and there are still unfair laws there are so many people who are still closeted there are plenty of people who still have people come into their homes and have dinner parties and people dont know that theyre gay and were not going to be able to make inroads into more fair laws and opportunities if more people dont realize how many gay neighbors they have
3987861 when i was informed of the mission and the vision behind this project i knew it was something i wanted to be involved in
3987862 we fostered her until march of 2008 and although the state recognized both of us as foster parents the state only recognizes one of as adoptive parents and im the adoptive parent which means im the only thats legally recognized this campaign is hopefully going to illustrate same sex couples should also be co parenting
3987863 they would tell you they have to eat vegetables and fruit and they have to do chores and the reality of our house is i would guess 99 percent the same as every other household on our block i mean the disney channel on in our house so i would say from our kids perspective i think its very very very similar to our neighbors
3987864 the last thing a parent wants to do is to put their child in harms way and while i dont feel like were necessarily doing that its a little nerve wracking and there were days i did feel sick to my stomach about it and we talked about that a lot but we felt like the cause was worthwhile and we need to do it
3987865 my true feeling was i came back to the code you have to be a part of the change you want to see in the world and there was no other way to do it and i think our families and our kids know that its a worthwhile cause
3987866 its kind of like the light at the end of the tunnel is getting a little bit bigger and bigger every day so it wont be until were completely moved out that you have that complete feeling of accomplishment its a great thing
3987867 i think the biggest highlight for our group has just been the safety record weve been able to pretty much demolish and also rebuild this entire interchange and allow traffic to keep going and everybody went home at the end of the day
3987868 when they get all the piles in the ground and that for me was probably one of the most challenging parts of the project because underground you do your best to try to figure out whats under there but you dont really know until you get to construction so that was a big sigh of relief and then when they erected the last girder on the project so every little step along the way is another little yippee
3987869 the interchange is pretty much a bridge project big big bridge project very seldom that you would see an interchange with all four cardinal directions being on bridges and let alone the nine ramps that we have here i mean theyre all on bridges so we have close to two million square feet of bridges youll never see another bridge project in the state of this magnitude
3987870 its a lot of touching up work down below were still going around putting downspout to drain the ramps and the sewer system in the ground yet we got to do we have to finish rough grading underneath the interchange so a lot of clean up activities too
3987871 because the webmaster sees the site everyday but the customer only sees it once or twice
3987872 i find that the customer can get more value for their money with linux
3987873 since linux provides many possible platforms customizations database options and programming language compatibilities
3987874 i triple check and test all our online casino website code many times before we launch a beta version for the marketing team to check the more people that test the website before the publish date the better since this is a great way to find any bugs that might throw a wrench in the works
3987875 while gradients and various hues and tones look cool on screen they dont reproduce well on a mug letterhead or stationary
3987876 i like to keep all pages to w3c html standards so that crawling by robots and human use is as errorless as possible
3987877 they are by far more skilled and less expensive than hiring a specialty in house staff for a online casino project as a result we just need a couple in house designers to help maintain the website after it is built and take care of odd jobs
3987878 also dont rule out the importance of your database language
3987879 we find that mysql works best in most all cases and provides the flexibility and reliability that we need for our intensive website creations
3987880 over and over expanding scientific knowledge has shown religious claims to be false none of the belief in gods has any merit
3987881 cest norme quand jai touch je me suis dit a y est je lai fait tellement de choses se concr tisent en m me temps

3987883 im a simple cheerful and friendly woman with great passion in writing
3987884 i would put chelsea manchester united and liverpool as favourites again but regarding arsenal im not sure if the squad has enough experience and quality to win
3987885 scolari is a good leader and he can do very well the only insights or advice i would give him ahead of his first season is that he is in a club that is ready to win
3987886 i seriously have received three marriage proposals over a bowl of my cheese grits
3987887 a student appearing for mat has to answer 200 questions within 150 minutes therefore he should not spend more than 25 to 30 minutes on the language comprehension section 35 to 40 minutes on mathematical skills 35 to 40 minutes on data interpretation analysis 35 to 40 minutes on logical reasoning and 15 to 20 minutes on india and the global environment though the marks on general awareness are not taken into consideration while calculating the percentile students should not ignore it as some institutes do consider the marks scored in that paper
3987888 as mat gives percentile scores the difficulty of the paper should not matter at all what matters is your individual score in respect to others
3987889 you should start with a section you are good at a bad start lowers morale and affects your performance you may experiment with various combinations before deciding on what works best for you
3987890 it is important to increase calculation speed by using short cut techniques while solving problems in maths memorising tables square roots and squares of numbers helps in solving questions quickly

3987894 its not about the age of the child its about the relationship between the educator and the student its about the educators ability to manipulate the student
3987895 we are trying to teach them to not give out their personal contact information not to make them their friends on facebook or myspace
3987896 this is so theyre not in a position to come back later and say i just didnt know
3987897 they know when they leave our trainings that its serious business
3987898 theyre all in china right now so we have the track to ourselves

3987904 i was sure i was going down but after five or six times around the track you get it then its awesome
3987905 you can learn the basic concepts fairly easily the rewarding thing is that you then can spend years learning thousands of micro techniques to make you better

3987911 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3987912 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3987913 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3987914 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3987915 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3987916 the king of high school basketball in new york city
3987917 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3987918 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3987919 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3987920 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3987921 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3987922 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3987923 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3987924 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3987925 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3987929 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3987930 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3987931 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3987932 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
3987933 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3987934 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3987935 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3987936 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
3987937 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3987938 few days back a representative of ras al khaimah authority made a visit to sonadia island they want to build an exclusive tourist zone at the island after that the tourism ministry has asked the parjatan corporation to conduct a feasibility study
3987939 all tidal surges cyclones at first hit the sonadia island so we are examining the environmental aspect very carefully and scientifically moreover the commercial aspect is also being considered with great importance
3987940 i agree that becoming a tourism paradise is obivously good if we vietnam can balance the major factors of people infrastructure environment and spply demand
3987941 meanwhile municipal regulators are granting licences for foreign investors all too easily and provinces are trying to reel in more and more money in order to polish up their names
3987942 the real life situations of many fdi projects in the southern provinces are at the top of our priorities list
3987943 everything is about image its all about the collective face everything has its base in how will this look and the thing is they dont care collectively how their own people view them its all about everyone else

3987948 now im home with my wife and kids and my frustration level isnt pegging out at 110 percent
3987949 he did real well he was able to put a different hat on
3987950 senseless act of depraved violence that touches all of us
3987951 he was a very effective leader for his party and an event like this certainly makes all politics seem small and insignificant
3987952 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
3987953 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney along with thousands of other arkansans ginger and i are trying to come to terms with such a shocking and senseless attack
3987954 i have a zero threshold for insignificant facts i will cut people off if they dont answer my question
3987955 being a state senator where i have a forum to criticize him
3987956 when youre down there at the capitol every day and youre frustrated sure you think about it
3987957 now im home with my wife and kids and my frustration level isnt pegging out at 110 percent
3987958 i lose my temper i cuss im prideful im arrogant i can name 50 sins i commit everyday i wish sometimes i could be more humble i really do
3987959 would you allow one of our people to come down and verify the body
3987960 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
3987961 gee mom id love to but not this time id like it to just be us
3987962 i was hoping for it to be just the four of us but you do bring up a good point i dont want anyone to feel left out however at this time i cant acommodate that many people and i really dont want to make anyone uncomfortable so we should just do this another time
3987963 yeah that sounds great but with the wedding preparation and limited space here it wouldnt be a problem having dinner for 7 at your place then would it
3987964 ngos do not have any enforcement powers but only advisory and assistance role when referrals are made to social welfare department action should be taken especially when it involves children
3987965 its the people attitude towards managing their needs we do acknowledge there are people in the society that need help which is generally provided but they do not take the initiative of striving to earn a dollar but resort to the easy way out by begging

3987967 arts alumni who graduated 5 10 15 and 20 years earlier will provide information about their formal arts training they will report the nature of their current arts involvement reflect on the relevance of arts training to their work and further education and describe turning points obstacles and key relationships and opportunities that influenced their lives and careers the results of the annual online survey and data analysis system will help schools strengthen their programs of study by tracking what young artists need to advance in their fields
3987968 the initial testing of the snaap questionnaire indicated that arts alumni were frustrated because the survey assumed a linear career and suggested that all events and experiences were equally important

3987975 we continue to anticipate stable market conditions for our plasma therapies business and growing contribution from royalties associated with the international sales of gardasil
3987976 the acquisition will make csl a stronger competitor in the highly competitive plasma therapeutics marketplace
3987977 csl is confident that there is significant scope to increase output and improve the efficiency profitability and cash flows of talecris by optimising plasma supply production flows and removing duplication between the businesses
3987978 global demand for csls plasma therapies continues as we enter new markets develop new therapies and find new indications for existing therapies

3988002 streets provide security in the form of prominent paths for concentrated pedestrian and vehicular movements windows and doorways when facing streets extend the zone of residents territorial commitments and allow for the continual casual surveillance by police in passing cars
3988003 these bordering streets have been deprived of continual surveillance by residents and have proven unsafe to walk along
3988004 winding access paths provide many opportunities for muggers to conceal themselves while awaiting the arrival of a victim

3988018 if its still as promising as it is now well go on to phase two in 2009
3988019 nothing personal bill but i think especially at this time when were looking at cracking down on landlords and the condition of our rental units in the city i believe the entire board of the aurora housing authority needs to be replaced
3988020 im not saying its any one individual but its obviously not working there is nobody that can look at that and say that organization is working properly it is a huge problem in this city
3988021 right now theyre a warehouse full of low income renters and theyre doing nothing to help those people succeed and exit the system
3988022 the conditions some of these folks live in are appalling
3988023 rentals are not a blight to this community and they never have been especially with our scattered site houses
3988024 you wouldnt be able to pick our home out of any neighborhood we have them in because we dont want them to stand out
3988025 we attempt to get our tenants involved in local social services but the constant turnover rate we face and our funding levels makes that difficult
3988026 negative impact they have on our school district police department and community and as a whole
3988027 they dont understand their role and as far as im concerned theyre there to pick up a 75 check twice a month
3988028 maybe they got involved to help but they quickly got in over their heads and havent bothered to get out
3988029 this is an excellent board every single one of them is very involved in the community and the housing authority
3988030 theyre all aurora residents and are very involved in the city they live in
3988031 were making policy based on only receiving 81 percent of our funding and that has always been a concern
3988032 i dont know any other entity that could operate as well as we do with a 19 percent cut in funding
3988033 i agree with lawrence and share many of his concerns about the housing authority
3988034 but that is a discussion we all need to have for a decision that we all need to make that decision cannot be made by one person

3988042 this deal makes tremendous sense for everybody involved abebooks now belongs to a company that is built on an aggressive investing gene and it will be fun watching from the sidelines to see where jeff bezos and team can take abebooks over the next years
3988043 money no enough 2 is not a sequel to the original film as the storyline is totally diffferent i will be sharing some of the personal finance lessons the film conveys and there will be some plot spoilers stop here if you have not watched the film

3988045 its interesting qantas often say that something may not be a safety issue but i wonder at what point in time things do become a safety issue is it when someones dead
3988046 the overall review is in the final stages of wrapping up but this of course will influence this so we will look at it separately to understand how the process worked or didnt work
3988047 the flight crew returned power to the engine and landed without incident
3988048 a fuel flow regulator will be replaced overnight and the flight back to melbourne will be rescheduled to operate tomorrow morning
3988049 hey thats not your real name either is it you just made that up
3988050 oh no hes going to ask me to do something
3988051 there is a reasonable chance that we will see something in the next congress
3988052 after behaving rather glacially there has been a huge jump forward just in the past year
3988053 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
3988054 i think its a well made picture but while its funny in spots its very english
3988055 i dont think its broadly commercial it feels like a film that deserves a spirited release but not a wide one joel has an 800 screen deal which well honor but we might not be willing to spend the marketing money he wants us to
3988056 because universal mccann already had sharepoint and newsgator built social sites to integrate specifically with sharepoint harrisons group was able to seamlessly add its new social network which would essentially become the new starting off point for the corporate intranet
3988057 we chose people who understood the technology and who realized why it had value
3988058 it sounds kind of like a hokey thing to do but it does really work when the browser pops open there it is
3988059 psychological challenges also change the nature of a telecommuting job as opposed to a face to face job
3988060 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3988061 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3988062 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3988063 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3988064 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3988065 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3988066 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3988067 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3988068 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3988069 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3988070 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3988071 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3988072 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3988073 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3988074 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3988075 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3988076 oh youre taking all these commercial activities out on the web why dont we bring those into your news feed and then all your friends can find out about it and itll be the marketers dream
3988077 hey do you mind if we see your friends because youre looking to share this thing with your friends and so we need to know where they are

3988081 share this functionality that actually youre familiar with and you want to use
3988082 this is the way its done this is how you do it and this is how you solve that problem
3988083 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3988084 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3988085 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3988086 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3988087 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3988088 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3988089 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3988090 logitech research revealed that the vast majority of people who use a notebook pc are mobile both within and outside the home
3988091 to meet the demands associated with increased mobility the v550 mouse offers a complete set of features to make it easier to use a mouse with a notebook when moving from the kitchen to the living room or from ones desk to a meeting now you wont have to choose between grabbing your mouse or a cup of coffee
3988092 we have to do it reform so that all of us the media us in government can start making decisions on crime and fight crime on a scientific basis at the moment we act on the basis of what we think we are seeing but it is not necessarily what we see
3988093 our whole area of keeping statistics is completely and utterly fragmented and dysfunctional
3988094 as i sit here today it is impossible to say what happened to the cases of the 18 000 murders that happened five years ago
3988095 because no one can tell you actually what the system is
3988096 just at a technological level to take us out of the stone age and bring us just to the 20th century not even the 21st century where many other countries are its going to take a huge effort to get those it systems going
3988097 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3988098 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3988099 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3988100 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3988101 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3988102 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3988103 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3988104 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3988105 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3988106 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3988107 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3988108 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3988109 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3988110 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3988111 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3988112 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3988113 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3988114 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3988115 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3988116 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3988117 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3988118 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3988119 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3988120 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3988121 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3988122 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3988123 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3988124 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3988125 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3988126 accused no 2 de kock also attended this party in the light of this information there is a possibility that another charge might be added to the investigation
3988127 after we were released from jail we couldnt go anywhere
3988128 for a year now ive been scared to leave the house people said i was scum and called us murderers
3988129 my brother is in matric this year and he doesnt even want to go to school because he is embarrassed people say he is the brother of a murderer and they keep their distance from him
3988130 we said it was impossible that her drink was spiked and decided to go to the police and tell them that nobody had given her drugs
3988131 if i think about it now i think about what an idiot i was we were going out that night and took some cat so we were on drugs when we went to the police
3988132 then piet byleveld arrived he said do you know me do you know me i said no and he said im piet byleveld im the top cop in this country to you im god
3988133 we were told that we would be charged with culpable homicide as soon as the autopsy came out it was because of that potential charge we were denied bail
3988134 we spent 78 days awaiting trial because of an alleged murder that we didnt commit
3988135 we saw things in jail they would take a fluorescent lightbulb break it and take out peoples eyes they took a fork and sharpened it against a wall and stabbed men in the kidneys
3988136 i just kept on thinking about my parents and what they thought of us we could have been killed and we could have been raped for something we didnt do
3988137 i saw them going through that and they looked at me like i did it but i didnt on the one hand i feel sorry for them on the other i just feel anger
3988138 nobody wanted to hear our side of the story have you ever googled our names we will always be thought of as murderers
3988139 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3988140 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3988141 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3988142 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3988143 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3988144 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3988145 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3988146 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3988147 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3988148 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3988149 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3988150 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3988151 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3988152 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3988153 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3988154 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3988155 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3988156 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3988157 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3988158 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3988159 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3988160 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3988161 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3988162 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3988163 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3988164 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3988165 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3988166 who are open to doing something on the production side
3988167 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3988168 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3988169 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3988170 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3988171 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3988172 they say barack im a republican but i support you
3988173 republicans are coming together in support of senator obama to bring change to washington
3988174 strong record s of bringing people together from the left and the right to solve problems
3988175 has a nice feel for sliding around in the pocket with the ability to feel the pressure and get away from it dimitroff told me likening it to that trademark part of
3988176 you have to like the way he stands tall in the pocket and the poise he already shows back there
3988177 its a learning curve and he knows that but he has a great outlook on it new falcons head coach
3988178 hes already told me coach i want to be your quarterback from day 1 but right now he knows its day to day
3988179 whatever it is i just want to keep knocking out those firsts ryan told me last week
3988180 the first practice the first scrimmage the first preseason game keep knocking them out so youve got more experience under your belt
3988181 i think ive gotten a lot better and the good thing about it is its kind of been a consistent curve ryan said of his first three months plus as a falcon
3988182 the biggest thing for me is to get in here and learn and pull my weight on the field in order to gain my teammates respect
3988183 woo pig sooey cheer at the press conference announcing his hiring as the arkansas head coach
3988184 evolving position on georgia but one cant fail to wonder if he remembers what he was doing in 2003 the irony of that statement surely wont be lost to any but the most deluded observers
3988185 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3988186 we may begin seeing pretty soon big american cities with no daily newspaper
3988187 mint has a handful of american citizens in its newsroom including me
3988188 india is a fascinating country where history is being made in many respects so it is a fertile place for good journalism hopefully some of the non indian journalists will have a better understanding of india when they do go back
3988189 its not the tough job market that sent me there yet i decided to go to india because the promised experience just seems tremendous readership is skyrocketing as are profits the managing editor also said he really wants to strengthen the multimedia elements of the web site and theres money available to put into development
3988190 i have met foreigners working at the hindu mint gq the hindustan times and times of india
3988191 they all work on indian salaries dont speak the language and all seem to be having a ball since there are so many new publications opening up in india there is a lot of demand for native english speakers and people who can bring higher reporting standards to local papers
3988192 i pretty much stick only to big investigative stories on subjects that i choose and leave the daily reporting and feature pieces to other journalists i have noticed that some american media houses are pulling back their freelance budgets just try getting an assignment past the foreign desk at npr these days but i bet that freelancers in america are feeling the pinch much more than i am while living on the rupee
3988193 id like to see more freelancers move to india there are too many stories to cover and just not enough time to get to them all
3988194 clearly its a company that was trying to do a whole bunch of things at one time and it is hard to finance that and historically the resort has had difficulty with finding the financing and it has more or less been built on cash
3988195 what the new ceo brings is two things for us expertise that we have not had before she has been extremely successful in other efforts elsewhere in the world and she also brings access to cash that we havent had before
3988196 as she analyzes the business whats clear to her is that our business should be the development of the resort and the operation of the resort as a vacation destination should be done by someone who can do it better than us
3988197 there never was any doubt in my mind regarding the official ratification on the part of the federal government
3988198 i was confident that an honourable working relationship had been established and it was just a matter of the federal government completing their requirements of the aip as did the federation of newfoundland indians
3988199 by voting in favour of ratifying this agreement in principle your members have taken a decisive step toward what i think is a bright and promising future full of new opportunities for the economy employment better education health care and quality of life issues in all of your communities
3988200 we can all take pride i think that this agreement was achieved through positive and productive negotiations between canada and the fni i believe it stands as an example of what can happen when parties work together towards common solutions and have a goal of getting the deal done
3988201 in terms of being a voice for youth and bringing them to the table to be involved in the decision making i think it needs to be a good solid representation of youth
3988202 there are a lot of leaders in our youth community no doubt but you almost need an equal number of youth or more than adults you dont want to lose the youth or have a disconnect i think it is really bringing a meaningful voice and strength comes in numbers for youth
3988203 its very difficult to erase and once it is out there it drastically can effect your future
3988204 we have been doing a lot of research on stats showing that a lot of young people today are not getting jobs because their potential employers are searching them on facebook and finding out what they did on friday night and not hiring them
3988205 we set aside the strict environmental protocols for this year but we would still take action in the event of extreme conditions
3988206 thats what we feel we have here now is extreme conditions the higher the water temperature the more stress salmon undergo particularly if its being caught and released or handled in any way
3988207 through the consultations we had a lot of discussions on the environmental protocols and there seemed to be a consensus that theres a benefit to having an angler on the river to deter illegal activity the feeling is if you close all the time for the environmental protocols its difficult to catch the fish so they may not catch that many but you take the anglers off the rivers leaving it wide open for illegal activity
3988208 theres a special management plan in place for bay st george north rivers
3988209 one of the management measures for this year is they would start the season as class 3 rivers thats two fish retention
3988210 with everything going the way it is if the price of gas doesnt go down the price of everything else will go up
3988211 as a single mother of two kids its affecting the cost of everything its too much
3988212 the price of oil keeps dropping and the price of gas keeps going up i cant go out as much on my own time im a third year university student so i have to drive to school each day i work so i have to drive back and forth
3988213 during the school year i make about 200 every two weeks and about half of that goes to gas
3988214 it seems to me the big gas companies are working a plan theyve been working on for years they raise the price 10 cents a litre then drop it two cents a litre and were supposed to be happy about it
3988215 we have the highest level of taxation on fuel in the country
3988216 when youre doing comparisons to the national average of course our price is going to be higher
3988217 no hay nadie que diga que act a por razones espurias o que cobra o recibe dinero
3988218 un nivel de desconfianza que no corresponde a un ndice de este tipo
3988219 est asombrada por la falta de seriedad en el manejo de las estad sticas
3988220 le quita seriedad a un gobierno que est haciendo las cosas bien
3988221 creo que moreno le est haciendo da o a la presidenta nadie lo tiene en cuenta pero aparece siempre
3988222 nunca me refer a la situaci n de ning n funcionario con respecto a medidas que son de exlcusiva competencia del gobierno

3988224 its the kind of summer comedy that rolls in makes a lot of people laugh and rolls on to video its been a good summer for that
3988225 fun impaired critics who complained that last weeks pineapple express went over the top ought to get a load of this weeks r rated laugh riot tropic thunder mount everest would look like a speck from this ones extreme altitude which is exactly how it should be ben stillers latest sends up all things overblown about hollywood and the perfect volume setting for this kind of satire is 11
3988226 simultaneously smart and dumb mixing clever satire with way over the top raunch and unrelenting profanity
3988227 there are some wildly funny scenes a few leaden ones and others that are scattershot with humorous satire undercut by over the top grisliness still when its funny its really funny
3988228 tropic thunder is an assault in the guise of a comedy
3988229 watching it is like getting mugged by a clown sure by my bruised reckoning there are a few chuckles here but youll definitely pay a price for them
3988230 in the end tropic thunder is an expensive goof about an expensive goof and the results are very impressive and fancy looking too impressive really to fully unleash the humor in the situations
3988231 for the nations interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3988232 people feel like they eat a great meal and later on you tell them there was a fly in it
3988233 with the entry of these well funded players into our space it has become increasingly clear that clickstar needs to align itself with a key partner to operate within the larger ecosystem we have decided to partner or sell clickstar
3988234 possible to bring back actors from the past and realistically put them in new films
3988235 we all agreed that we had been irresponsible and that in an effort not to seem elitist we had remained quiet during this strike we hadnt voiced our objections we hadnt put pressure on patric verrone and the other heads of the union to end this thing
3988236 we named who we were in the room and said that if we didnt see fast action over the next forty eight hours that we would have to make our feelings public
3988237 i know that the strike ended i could have been for entirely different reasons
3988238 it is a first i guess they are going after the insomniac vote
3988239 that the failure of the films producers to get it into theaters helped preserve the real genius of this soulful obscurity
3988240 it seems to fuel buzz and interest and drive the olympic fan and viewer to primetime television
3988241 what were seeing with digital is its doing the same thing but with a much greater appetite and intensity
3988242 what its doing is giving those channels an opportunity to promote themselves to people who wouldnt normally have been there
3988243 any idea of what your kid is doing right now
3988244 there is at least one more chapter we ultimately want to see the characters make it back to new york
3988245 we love bernie he made an amazing contribution to this movie
3988246 there is a heart and soul that he brought to zuba
3988247 it is a testament to software and computing power and how it has advanced and to the talent of the people at the studio
3988248 im just trying to keep this short its starting to rain
3988249 filmmaking in latin america is making a remarkable contribution to world cinema
3988250 the show is a different maid in a different manhattan
3988251 while the hotels clientele is an obvious part of this world im more interested in the downstairs part of upstairs downstairs
3988252 i imagine being a writer in hollywood is often very similar to being a maid in manhattan
3988253 she will be very integral in the pilot and series
3988254 we will treat everyone fairly and we intend to keep our word
3988255 its the story of a familys collapse but with the complexity that relationships have today
3988256 its a different world now one that i think is more open and more destructive somehow
3988257 the italian in new york tends to import a cultural system and the question is how with american children he can find the right way to communicate with american children
3988258 we will try to keep as much of the original as possible im not trying to reinvent it
3988259 the show is a different maid in a different manhattan she lopez will be very integral in the pilot and series
3988260 im done with the whole hellraising days i prefer to stay home these days and watch old re runs
3988261 i was training with a teacher for the movie i cant paint thats for sure im terrible at it
3988262 francis stated that he planned on exposing how exactly mr wynn deceives his high end customers with reckless disregard for the truth
3988263 if they want to do it and they are talented enough i would support them but theyd have to express an interest on their own
3988264 id rather they didnt pursue it but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3988265 she feels so completely disassociated from who doris day was she signs her notes as clara she answers the phone as clara
3988266 i mean respect a cat thats a mans man this is how he did his thing all these years he made millions like this now you know people may say that wasnt the time or place but it was bernie macs time and bernie macs place and thats how he looked at it
3988267 obama is a politician and theyre pretty much going to say what they need to say at whatever time bernie was he didnt have a season he did what he did
3988268 cruise is begging for mi 4 mission impossible 4 but paramount wants a younger cheaper guy he had a tantrum and ran out of the meeting
3988269 you know mac was a storyteller pryor was the king of storytelling and in a very special cultural way you know pryor just like bernie whether you grew up in his neighbourhood or you were around his lifestyle he painted the picture and made you see it
3988270 and i dont see how pryor couldnt have been an influence he was an influence on all of us
3988271 i stay away from the tabloids im not going to talk about lindsay because shes my friend you know shes great shes also 22 years old i think people forget that
3988272 with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
3988273 i love the ronsons theyre close to my heart and i respect all the work they do samantha and my relationship is a private matter
3988274 i was supposed to be in the pilot and then i had daughter stella when they went back into production so it didn t work out but i m hoping to return later in the season
3988275 i cannot confirm any such rumour at this time although i am a huge fan of qts and would love to work with him at some point i have received no official offer at this point
3988276 were going to eventually make a 24 movie one day if fans are still interested by then
3988277 its so hard for the writers to just even get through the season theyre very good but its just the equivalent of making 12 films a year and then they have to come up with a whole new idea in the break for the next year
3988278 so we all agreed to preserve the series just to focus on that and then when the series is done we would embark on the film
3988279 eva is desperately trying to get pregnant with tony parker
3988280 after they phone their doctor she promised me i will be the next call
3988281 i see him all the time at least once a week we still have feelings for each other i still love him and i think he loves me
3988282 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3988283 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day
3988284 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3988285 it happened very casually he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and had sex
3988286 like a dagger going through my heart it hurt so bad
3988287 he casey thought she was just saying she was pregnant to get him back because at that point they were broken up once again he told me it wasnt true and not to worry
3988288 at no point did he say kelli shes pregnant we cant do this anymore its not right we would hang out and hook up have sex i dont know where jamie lynn thought he was he probably said he was just going out with the guys but really he was coming to be with me
3988289 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop but even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3988290 i think that he is trapped when i see jamie lynn doing interviews and talking about how happy she is with casey it seems so fake shes trying to paint a pretty picture but its messy art
3988291 i want the best for him aldridge i would never trap him into a life with me i would want casey to be with me for the right reasons because he wanted to
3988292 im just not rhythmic like that i might shake my booty but ill be off the beat my sister ashlee has got all the rhythm in the family
3988293 its the early stages of dating she is a little boy crazy over him
3988294 adam is in outstanding shape he works out an hour a day and walks with his big dog on his farm in sun valley idaho
3988295 he is not definite yet but is one of the people they are seriously looking at they will decide on everyone on aug 25
3988296 i had spoken with him probably in the last you know maybe about the last three weeks and he was definitely talking about producing some more movies and he planned on producing some other movies he had even looked at doing television again
3988297 bernie was too big out there he was too big on stage for bernie mac not to tell jokes again not to stand on the stage with a microphone a bar stool a spotlight and a bottle of water i cant even see that you know
3988298 there are thousands of models like all the other thousands of models naomi campbell is the same way for me models are just pieces of wood that i carve to make clothes look beautiful
3988299 i was having breakfast at the peninsula hotel in chicago and we had gotten a text message and of course we just we had written it off as the rumour the same rumour that had happened the week before so we didnt think anything of it
3988300 and then reverend al sharpton walked into the restaurant and came up to me and said im so sorry about your boy
3988301 and i was looking at him my boy and then he said its true man bernie mac passed
3988302 women kind of wilt as men achieve as they get older like wine its like oh shes past her prime and cant play a sex symbol
3988303 its just a preconceived notion about women in general and particularly in this industry its a very very vain industry
3988304 my hair and make up artists spend hours upon hours plastering things on me to make me look sexier i think its rare that you feel beautiful
3988305 i have never texted or emailed senator obama and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise
3988306 in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone
3988307 i would hope that my friend obamas republican rival john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics
3988308 although i support senator obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me
3988309 bernies not the guy thats going to take the day off because hes sick
3988310 i went to see him in the hospital and even when he was in the hospital he was still bernie and he came back to work and he was on oxygen and actually came to work and between takes was on oxygen and he would take the oxygen mask off and do a take and then put the oxygen back on because he couldnt get enough oxygen into his lungs
3988311 i think bernie was too busy living to worry about not living i dont know if he was worried about his health but i know he was a hard enough working man that he came to work with an oxygen tank on that he would take off between takes because he wanted to be there to support everybody
3988312 we had no idea for the longest time and even then he showed up at work like trying to pass it off it was no big deal
3988313 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby
3988314 and now the baby was having a baby i was shocked a little bit it was mind boggling
3988315 i m sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3988316 a big budget should mean the film will look a lot better than some of the old movies
3988317 hes my first true love since rod and the age difference isnt an issue
3988318 i think they did it issue an arrest warrant to pretty much scare us from coming back
3988319 i went and had a meeting with the foreign minister and he said i was welcome anytime very kind man very welcoming and he said i was his most welcome guest so theres a shocker
3988320 the culture is such that its one of the kindest most polite most welcoming cultures you can ever run across
3988321 theres been a bit of tension for some time they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3988322 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3988323 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3988324 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance
3988325 cash and i have been glued to the olympics how amazing was the opening ceremony i still dont know how they co ordinated 2008 people to move in perfect sync
3988326 the mens 400m relay was insane we were down by almost a half body length going into the final turn and then next thing you knew it was closer closer closer until we touched the wall first cash and i went crazy
3988327 the press thinks were at war over salary with tori i didnt know i was at war with tori
3988328 im really bummed because i love tori and i was psyched tori was going to be on the show i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid
3988329 her father created the show it just seems wrong if thats the case i dont know what really happened because i havent talked to her i would like to talk to her
3988330 ill try to butt my head in whenever i can and tell people what i think about it
3988331 they didnt even get the numbers right so i dont know if its about the money either
3988332 whoever receives one such child in my name receives me

3988334 the computer in aunt ethels back bedroom may be right now playing a role in a cyber warfare campaign
3988335 we dont know for certain it is russia attacking georgia and vice versa or if the attacks are sanctioned by the military but there is clearly disruption taking place as the governments take pot shots at each other
3988336 the shadow economy is very similar to the real world economy
3988337 specialisation drives competition and high quality goods and all the things that make the real world economy tick
3988338 many states have established special investigative units or task forces on child predators
3988339 few states have devoted similar investigative resources toward cracking down on internet fraud
3988340 internet crime costs basically nothing to execute can be highly lucrative and involves little risk of being caught and punished we need all 50 state attorneys general focused on this problem
3988341 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
3988342 jericho being thrown into a match with kane for no reason halts the momentum from the months of great character building

3988365 im sorry maam but its not my job to do anything about it its your sons job to do the work necessary to pass the class unfortunately the final is next week and he needs something like a perfect score to earn a passing grade i dont see that happening
3988366 but youre the teacher if you would just teach him what he needs to know for the final exam he can graduate and transfer to a real college a college with an athletic scholarship waiting for him
3988367 begging your pardon sir teaching your son what he needs to know is exactly what ive been trying to do all semester but its hard to do when hes not there
3988368 dammit hes an athlete he has to practice hes busy its your job to make sure he passes
3988369 did you tell your parents you had to miss your math class to practice with your teammates is that what you said
3988370 have you and your parents talked to your coach yet

3988385 it is my pleasure to relay that the panel of game industry experts felt the overall standard of this years entries exceeded all their expectation both in terms of breadth of subject matter and overall game quality

3988389 according to the firm virtual worlds are currently in the trough of disillusionment stage of gartners five stage hype cycle and are suffering from disillusionment due to inflated unrealistic expectations during their peak of hype in 2007

3988394 interestingly enough parents guardians were pegged as the biggest facilitators for getting the controversial game into the hands of these young respondents garnering 80 percent of the response
3988395 friends siblings and other relatives rounded out the other 20 percent of the response
3988396 i heard the red wings put in a claim on me
3988397 thats what id bet ive heard there were claims but that doesnt mean anything
3988398 washburn came and asked me can you tell me who claimed me
3988399 i dont know anything about that i havent heard anything about that i have to think at this time of year a lot of players get put on waivers and a lot of guys get claimed
3988400 its so speculative and so out of my control its truly irrelevant from what im trying to do on the field
3988401 im not saying its impossible but its more complicated now
3988402 youve got to look out for the best interests of the organization but certainly wash has done a great job
3988403 raul his performance speaks for itself and of course we love having him we hope whatever happens is best for the organization and best for raul
3988404 were going to be having r a available in the bullpen from this point
3988405 we just want to look at some other options basically r a has been a staff saver for us hes given us some good starts hes done some great stuff between starts and when hes pitched strictly in the bullpen hes done a good job
3988406 i think the best way for him to help the club is out of the bullpen
3988407 we looked into working a deal with some teams but it just wasnt there
3988408 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
3988409 its quite striking that 10 year olds are watching these movies

3988411 we are deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation in the indian occupied kashmir which is resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people and violation of their human rights

3988414 i had very hard moments but now i wakeup every morning lucid and willing to call my daughters im great
3988415 when i was bad i was ashamed of going out to the street but today im fine and is thanks to them
3988416 our q2 financial performance was disappointing the desktop pc market around the world weakened during the quarter and our miscalculation of competitive price position further pressured our desktop gpu business
3988417 i sort of suspect that if you didnt play or love the first one itll probably leave you baffled for a long time
3988418 and then suddenly youll have an epiphany in which you utterly understand it and what its trying to do
3988419 some of the time its like warioware some of the time its like gradius some of the time its like brain training
3988420 but you never know what to expect you never know if a map is going to be over in two seconds or if youll be dodging bullets for five minutes
3988421 in essence it is simply a 2d side scrolling shoot em up
3988422 as with so many things the journey is so much greater than the destination so much of the pleasure of playing bangai o lies in discovering that enormous variety and getting to grips with the twisted logic that underpins it all
3988423 as you work your way through the 160 levels that perplexing logic gradually reveals itself until you succumb
3988424 its when you start to pick up on the jokes or the tributes or the experiments that youll begin to realise why bangai o is so utterly amazing thats when youll start to forgive its imperfections and its flaws because when bangai o fails it fails gloriously or bafflingly or interestingly
3988425 bangai o was one of the quirkier offerings from treasure featuring an insane amount of enemies and bullets onscreen almost a decade later the game has finally been updated for the 2d friendly nintendo ds
3988426 significant new features have been added like four player co op and a robust level editor it needs to be said though this game is for the hardcore only a sinister voice laughs at you when you die for petes sake unless youre a masochist shooter fan that enjoys a real challenge bangai o spirits is likely to frustrate you
3988427 post tutorial youre set loose in free play mode where all of the games levels are unlocked from the start i tend to think of freedom as a good thing but games are usually heavily structured environments that lead players through objectives of increasing difficulty here even level one is punishingly brutal
3988428 not all is lost though because bangai o is still fun and its a unique entry in a genre that doesnt see a lot of innovation
3988429 filling the entire screen with a torrent of bullet spray never gets old
3988430 there is a lot of blasting and dodging but your weapons can be customized for each level
3988431 but some levels dont even require weaponry like an early puzzle level where you push blocks onto targets around a maze
3988432 the approach certainly limits the games audience but if youre a fan of the genre it should please you to know that treasure loves it just as much as us and made this game just for us
3988433 only an obscure niche of gamer is looking for a game like bangai o spirits
3988434 any genius the game has only reveals itself after a hefty time commitment the early hours are baffling and complex the game is plagued by slowdown and confusing controls
3988435 youll find a rich and varied experience filled with brain teasing puzzles insanely intense action plus a fully featured level editor and sharing system to keep fans addicted even after finishing every stage
3988436 there really isnt any context to the levels youll play just a sequence of unconnected stages
3988437 for the short levels that follow success becomes about the trial and error of picking the appropriate weapons and following the right path to completion it can be tedious but its also awash in interesting strategies and puzzle solutions
3988438 an unfair learning curve and some noticeable technical bugs haunt the title
3988439 but its also filled with varied content given enough patience it reveals some refreshingly challenging gameplay for me it was a vacillating mix of frustration and brilliance
3988440 our motivations and ambitions of course are to continue on all three platforms
3988441 the ten year strategy is ingrained in all of us scea president and ceo jack tretton has brought that to all levels of the organization
3988442 the price of the ps3 is high but youre paying for potential
3988443 whether its skype or some other peripherals its not just a dumb terminal that lies secluded and isnt enhanced with all the recent technologies and opportunities
3988444 blu ray is bigger and blu ray games are going to be the biggest games in the industry
3988445 i think that feeds into gamers choices as well i think there are a lot of great that consumers are going to find with music and the movie store you buy it for a gaming machine but it delivers on a value proposition
3988446 every million units of ps2s we sell in 2008 is just a great opportunity for us to upgrade as they get closer to hd households

3988448 over the years traditional indian garments have all but disappeared from our fashion shows more importantly the craftsmanship that indian artisans are so well known for seems to have taken a back stage we need to revive this
3988449 weve noticed that if designers showcase indian garments at fashion weeks they are criticised because of the impression that such events are meant to display only pr t collections
3988450 there is also the feeling that buyers who attend fashion shows are essentially looking at foreign markets and thus would not react to indian designs
3988451 in fact the couture week was on the fdcis to do list but it never happened now its on
3988452 the worst hit industrial sectors are tourism fruit hosiery carpets handicrafts dry fruits tourism forest based products and herbs and herbal products
3988453 in the last one and half months exports fell by at least 30 percent because of the agitation which has brought the movement of goods particularly fruits to a virtual halt
3988454 if the agitation goes on the economy of the state will suffer major jolt as people who had lined up over rs 50 billion worth of investment for fiscal 2008 09 will depart to the neighbouring states of punjab haryana and himachal pradesh
3988455 agitations of this nature discourage investors and therefore peace and tranquillity must prevail in the state to ensure that its industrial prospects are not derailed
3988456 eat sleep and swim that s all i can do get some calories into my system and try to recover the best i can
3988457 while the book remains a work of fiction it has an underlying reference to emedha philosophy which is a realistic paradigm for it world this unique combination of a new it paradigm being presented through a fictious storyline will make this book an interesting read
3988458 in due course i plan to finish a novel trilogy and few other books that would speak to the readers explore prod and even embrace them in their lives
3988459 although the cop was in civvies the mob identified him by his identity card they set fire to his motorcycle and beat him up mercilessly

3988466 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3988467 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3988468 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3988469 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3988470 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3988471 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3988472 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
3988473 you sure talk sweet to jeff you sure youre just going to play basketball
3988474 returning from munich 70 years ago in 1938 british prime minister neville chamberlain said about czechoslovakia which had just been dismembered its a small far away place about which we know nothing
3988475 those countries who value freedom and democracy must stand up for it whenever it is threatened
3988476 we cant allow a second munich when the international community climbed down to hitler
3988477 if military aggression is being justified by the need to protect russian citizens then this should cause concern for all countries with russian nationals living within their borders
3988478 no state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state
3988479 aint nothin gonna stop me so just envy it hey ill accept a friendly quit im me bitch im me so who you youre not me youre not me and i know that aint fair but i dont care

3988481 there are no signs of the russians letting in anyone else
3988482 i dont really see it happening at the moment the russians are firmly in control
3988483 no point in us getting lost in a long debate today about responsibility for and origins of the escalation of the last few days
3988484 the only thing id say at this point is that the matter has been settled to all the parties satisfaction
3988485 it would not be in his interest to jeopardize the settlement in any way
3988486 kids are being introduced to a different variety at a younger age

3988492 no matter what they did they were going to look bad
3988493 people love to hear this stuff about the big bad airlines and how theyre picking on everybody
3988494 after recently hearing of the burden the military reimbursement process put on soldiers traveling to war zones the choice for us to forgo payment for a third checked bag from the department of defense was clear
3988495 if they tried to defend themselves theyd look like a horrible company that hates the troops even though they have the facts on their side
3988496 waiving the fee was the best move they could make given how this thing has snowballed
3988497 due to some circumstances there wasnt enough to give to the das office so it was never filed
3988498 i hope that his passing will bring some comfort to those he so deeply wounded
3988499 i think at some level we should be grateful that late in his life he acknowledged that he was hiv positive and i hope that prompted some of his victims to get tested
3988500 if theres a silver lining its that he cant hurt vulnerable children or young adults anymore
3988501 he was very personable very outgoing easy to work with
3988502 he was a good preacher and very popular with the congregation
3988503 he personally loved helping people he gave to a lot of charities ive seen all that
3988504 right now its just between him and the good lord

3988507 i have rarely heard of another nonprofit organization of that size without a development director
3988508 with a full time professional development director raising that 70 000 for china would have been completely doable
3988509 seeing any decline in our contributed revenues we now understand that our novel approach of having several volunteers instead of a single professional fundraiser was not a very successful solution
3988510 the only school numbers ive seen were combined so i couldnt confirm whether the dallas numbers if separated out are a drain on revenues
3988511 those numbers sound high to me but i dont have the precise documented figures in front of me
3988512 is never to break the bank of the ballet but to try to bring up its standards and our ticket sales have been particularly strong with those full length ballets
3988513 but i will still look to do whatever i can do to make the company successful
3988514 without effective planning our ability to protect the personal security of both our residents and visitors would be severely compromised

3988523 if carbohydrate blockers were the magic bullet for achieving weight loss the epidemic of obesity would never have become the problem that it is today the ability to choose what foods move from your plate into mouth is the most powerful carbohydrate blocker and weight loss aid on the market every product touted as a weight loss miracle pales in comparison to our own ability to control food selection and intake amount

3988661 the problem with homelessness is that you cant get out of it its almost like a catch 22
3988662 we made more money in the rain there last year than we did the previous year
3988663 its been a chronic problem weve had investigators in and out of the facility for quite some time
3988664 the important thing here is everybody is held to the law with regard to the treatment of animals
3988665 this year was a huge step in the growth process that weve had because were reaching out to so many different age groups and ethnic groups
3988666 the addition of gospelfest is really a great event to add this year because of the interest in the performers and bands that will be taking part on the main stage
3988667 when you go up there its not like they put a number on you saying youre hitting fourth today
3988668 he comes to play hard he come up with big hits
3988669 youre never going to replace any guy on this team you just try to manage when theyre gone
3988670 last night we were able to make it up but tonight you cant keep expecting to try to make that up
3988671 we made it a little more interesting than we needed to
3988672 the charges against mr villegas are part of a larger investigation that encompasses mr mcdougle and that investigation is ongoing
3988673 i have not heard from anyone the district attorney or the fbi that there was anything new of relevance against my client
3988674 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
3988675 they are forcing me to lie because they want to convict kenny smith
3988676 they told me if i dont give them the testimony they want me to testify to theyll revoke my plea agreement
3988677 i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years
3988678 i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years
3988679 we saw and tested the movie and we believe a strong movie deserves a strong play date
3988680 youll find us all down there in the end zone doing a little dance
3988681 its a little different but at the same time i think its going to be a good experience
3988682 of course arthur has more size to him and he knows the game roane hes learning too he picks up fast quick thats what i like about him
3988683 chemistry wise it would have been different had vernon left post spring ball
3988684 but because we got that chance to work in spring ball we already got a little bit of rhythm going with those guys
3988685 i got out on my front foot but i was able to keep my hands back which is obviously the key to hitting i got it a little off the end but i obviously got enough of it
3988686 been seeing the ball well and swinging the bat well here particularly the last third of the season
3988687 he was frustrated early in the season just getting back in the groove again its really nice to see him swinging the bat right now when we particularly need him going into the stretch run i think hes feeling confident at the plate and i think everyone else is confident when hes at the plate
3988688 on first at bats were always going to be patient and try to see a lot of pitches so we get a read on a pitcher no matter what night it is
3988689 so him going deep in the count and fouling off tons of balls it just worked out that way
3988690 the first prototype was built partly while on a camping holiday with my wife a small tool kit and lots of pieces of curved metal
3988691 eventually i fabricated one that worked and showed it to innovation specialists at the caparo innovation centre at wolverhampton university who helped me refine and validate the design after talking to several potential investors it was presented to caparos ceo angad paul who immediately saw the potential and agreed to back it through to production
3988692 we are full time investment dragons with a proven record of success
3988693 when we back something we have done our research and we know it is going to work
3988694 it was interesting watching the contrasting approach applied to a rival product recently featured on dragons den
3988695 our system has spent eighteen months at our technical centre undergoing the same rigorous development and validation processes that are required by our prestige vehicle manufacturer customers
3988696 it provides the same levels of durability performance and safety as the rest of a high quality modern car and will not corrode or rattle it is thoroughly developed and currently in the final stages of production testing before delivery of the first batches to vehicle fleets whos professional managers have already recognised its potential to save time and money
3988697 the deceleration in export growth was the main reason for the slowdown in industrial output
3988698 a rise in enterprise production costs have also impacted industrial output
3988699 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
3988700 alans father was a mountain and his mother was a washing machine he kept a roof over their heads and she kept their clothes clean
3988701 i always say i dont mind being joe armstrong anyway
3988702 the audience is every four years for the olympics or when lance armstrong was winning the tours thats american cycling so i hope that winning a gold medal will bring the fans out for more than just one day every four years
3988703 its good to get a game like this under our belts
3988704 its good to have your backs against the wall every now and then it shows how we keep fighting were not just going to let down because another team is competing with us
3988705 you can throw her outside and she can beat you you can throw it inside and she can beat you you can throw it in the dirt and she can golf it you can throw it 10 feet over her head and she can tomahawk it
3988706 we all kind of laugh because she can do almost anything that she wants
3988707 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
3988708 i block that out of my mind i dont worry about that
3988709 hes just an incredible athlete and i wish him the best
3988710 we actually hung out a little bit this offseason at some different events were fine we talk like normal people we dont worry about the comparisons
3988711 there were a lot of things left on the field that could have been better williams said
3988712 hes going to do big things in this league for a long time bush said of williams
3988713 a lot of pitchers give hitters too much credit pauls a guy whos reinvented himself multiple times in his career
3988714 one thing thats always been consistent is his strike throwing
3988715 but we dont just go for size we go for athleticism and size we have three pro bowlers in the offensive line
3988716 they won super bowls with it they are good at what they do they come at you from all angles it presents an interesting challenge for us
3988717 hes a big aggressive receiver who likes to go get the ball owens said
3988718 i felt 38 today im not going to lie to you
3988719 there will come a day when they get the point theyll know were not leaving
3988720 after all people dont actually get over experiences especially profound ones as much as they incorporate them into their character and personality a
3988721 el centro se est cayendo a pedazos mandan unos auditores que no hacen realmente su trabajo
3988722 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3988723 its a huge situation for me after 35 years because ive wanted to bring one back
3988724 this whole thing unfolded about two weeks ago when these two boys came on a talk show here in the states and announced theyd found a bigfoot body
3988725 the commentator asked them if they could send someone to see the body and they said the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body is the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
3988726 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there
3988727 i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being
3988728 we trekked in for a day a half what kind of lunatic would be out here in a monkey suit i saw the thing i touched it
3988729 theyre fine guys one works for the police department in georgia and the other was a correctional officer theyre pretty credible guys
3988730 well release the dna analysis and well have the body right next to the two boys then you can see its real that its not all bullshit
3988731 as long as his part time business doesnt affect his work ethic
3988732 his claims of finding bigfoot is entirely a different matter unfortunately thats spilling over into his police life and thats where we have concerns when he comes back from medical leave well have to sit down and address those issues
3988733 hed bring a lot of leadership a whole lot of leadership and a whole lot of smarts
3988734 he understands the game of football i learned an awful lot from him while i was out in denver it was great playing with him i was fortunate i came in right when he got there it was great for me just to learn the game of football from someone with that experience and hes won a super bowl title before so he knows what it takes to win too
3988735 i loved playing with him he was a great teammate hes going to do whatever he can to help the team win hes a smart player he always knows whats going on hell pick up the defense in no time hell bring one more leader to this veteran group
3988736 the rolex monterey historic automobile races is great for all fans because most people have only seen these cars in magazines or static locations the event is literally a rolling museum of these historic vehicles that fans can hear smell and touch
3988737 monterey historics is the place if you love cars all the best racing cars in the world take part its toys for big boys
3988738 this is the premier event for historical race cars that have so much history and prestige car enthusiasts like me have enjoyed this event for years
3988739 why not talk only about the positive aspects of reaching mid life
3988740 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
3988741 im very pleased that finally justice has been done mainly for my soldiers because it was them who actually fought face to face with the enemy
3988742 they fought over and above what would be expected of young national service soldiers with very little experience
3988743 they repelled wave after wave of assaulting suicidal attacks and not one of the enemy got inside our position thanks to them
3988744 it was just sad that we lost 18 soldiers that day
3988745 its good to see a situation where we are now getting some justice with respect to these long standing issues
3988746 every single one of the men who were involved in this contact and battle have the right to be very proud today
3988747 unskilled and unaware of it how difficulties in recognizing ones own incompetence lead to inflated self assessments

3988765 in the end we felt it was more appropriate to honor the el caminos unique place as part of chevys heritage and not use that nameplate on a pontiac
3988766 its not everyday that a manufacturer announces a vehicle that creates a whole new segment in a market but with this the first ute export to north america in the form of the g8 sport truck is exactly what pontiac is doing

3988782 millions of people live and work in terrible conditions but the government doesnt think of them
3988783 they have spent our taxes on buildings and who does it help it does nothing for the people of this country
3988784 its all for beijing but what about the rest of the country
3988785 what about those who lost their homes in the earthquake what about the people who try to feed their families and send their children out to work
3988786 this contract is a further endorsement of the strength of our brand in our core markets and our ability to deliver industry leading buses
3988787 were not immune to the market downturn and our business model anticipated losses arising from some of our lending the slowdown in the wider economy means we believe those losses may come about more quickly than expected but were taking the necessary action to contain them
3988788 we said at the start of the year that 2008 would be a year of consolidation rather than growth our focus on maintaining our financial strength including rigorous control of costs while satisfying our existing customers means we are weathering this storm and will come out stronger
3988789 a lot of our stakeholders would see the sale as a natural step
3988790 i have looked in detail at each area of our operations and how they could be improved and believe there are sufficient opportunities in our three other divisions that can lead to an exciting future for nwf
3988791 this is another significant contract win and augments our order book which at the end of june was already 32 per cent ahead of 12 months ago
3988792 we anticipate that order intake and trading performance will remain strong throughout the year and that we will make further good progress in the second half of the year
3988793 the remaining specialist distribution businesses are well placed to weather a challenging economic environment and have several platforms for development which the group will continue to work on
3988794 if values have fallen by 20 per cent and your costs have gone up the question is of viability no one is going to develop a scheme with no profit
3988795 the situation at stockport is undoubtedly a blow for them but the question is now is it the tip of the iceberg and i think it will be unless the creative minds from all sides get together to find a solution
3988796 we need to debate and innovate or at best a lot of these regeneration projects will be delayed until better economic conditions at worst they will fall away
3988797 one area has to be of financial risk sharing because the banks are so wary about funding at the moment which i think will enable delivery of regeneration schemes
3988798 the virtual drying up of debt funding from the banks has been key if the public sector could inject real equity into projects as partners then i think the banks may be more minded to fund projects
3988799 if we dont try and find a solution then i think its going to be a pretty dismal time for regeneration
3988800 we have a good track record of innovation and trail blazing in this part of the world and that gives me heart that a solution can be found
3988801 on the sites where we have delayed work we will wait until the tide turns it may be a couple of years before the banks are in a more positive mode but i have faith in those sites
3988802 we cant bury our heads in the sand and ignore the wider economic picture we just have to work twice as hard
3988803 i think in times like this you really have to play to your strengths and that is sectors like creative new media it and financial services
3988804 wed be fooling ourselves if we didnt realise that some projects are going to be postponed
3988805 but manchester has a fantastic complementary offer to london that is why despite the market conditions i am pretty confident
3988806 our project pipeline is the strongest it has ever been our investment bank strategy is progressing well and we hope to have some very positive news for manchester soon
3988807 i think the situation we are in is a blip its just a question of how long this will last
3988808 we are in a difficult economic period money is scarce and to the extent that it is available its usually more expensive
3988809 in manchester our strength is the diversity of our economy

3988816 it is clear that the credit crunch has hit the uk hard
3988817 we approached stagecoach as it has become increasingly difficult as a small operator to compete with the major players particularly as fuel prices have risen so much

3988824 we have placed the conditions in the standing committee and it would be approved soon the deeal should be implemented within the coming month
3988825 the stadium was available at a token rent and mostly used for other purposes the icl proposal will be discussed with the standing committee chairman and a consensus will be drawn
3988826 during the riots we saw many relatives of patients hunting desperately for food most of them poor we started this tiffin service in 2002 says hemant patel one of the do gooders
3988827 our aim is to provide fresh food the menu includes roti sabji khichdi and shiro people can rent a tiffin carrier by depositing rs 150 when their kin is discharged from hospital they return the tiffin box and get a refund
3988828 our service is on humanitarian grounds irrespective of caste or community but some people pressurized us to exclude muslims however we have restarted our effort for us there is only one mantra ishwar allah tere naam sabko tiffin do bhagwan
3988829 i just kept it in my head that my dear generals eyes would be watching over me and that encouraged me to lift this weight
3988830 i am overjoyed by the fact that i have brought great joy to our dear leader this is the biggest present for the 60th anniversary of the foundation of the republic
3988831 i wanted to bring joy to the people of the dprk but i failed to do so
3988832 we will not let down our country or our leaders
3988833 i thought of our great leader and i knew with his encouragement and trust in us we would get the victory
3988834 i looked to the skies of pyongyang and drew inspiration from him i only wish he could have been here in person i hope that our great leader kim jung il gets the news of this victory and that he is happy
3988835 later i found out that they were the cheerleading team that had gone to south korea
3988836 im pretty confident im hitting the ball really well which is good tee to green im really well
3988837 im working on my putts a little bit i feel good about the way im swinging the club
3988838 im working the best to my ability to fix it you know and i think its improving its a step but its improving
3988839 i think everybody can enjoy it over here its not very long so you dont really need you know to hit driver every hole
3988840 a lot of guys coming over here its a tight enough golf course where you can enjoy it as well it requires attention and theres a lot of tricky holes out there its got a lot of variety
3988841 im not going to think about the future right now
3988842 michelles global notoriety will no doubt attract a following at ottawa hunt and im sure golf fans will offer her a tremendous welcome as she challenges the worlds best players
3988843 im really excited to play here and im really excited to be here too
3988844 its a great golf course and i think its going to be a great last event
3988845 people need to be waking up to the realities of the world and that the days of easy money have come to a pretty sudden end
3988846 there is an awful lot of talk about big transfers and major demands of players but you will find throughout the uk and europe that money is not quite as easy to obtain as it used to be
3988847 were expecting the levels of transfer fees this summer to still to be quite high but probably not as high as the record that was set last summer
3988848 euro 2008 happened towards the start of the summer transfer window
3988849 the level of transfer activity at the start of a window sometimes decreases when there is a major tournament taking place
3988850 another factor is that the 2008 09 season is the second year of a three year broadcast deal and the level of broadcasting revenues to clubs this year will be broadly similar to what they received last year
3988851 so were not seeing a step change in the amount of revenues that clubs are getting year on year
3988852 another point is weve not seen anything like the number of changes in club ownership in the last 12 months compared to the previous 12 months
3988853 there arent several new owners of premier league clubs for whom this window is their first opportunity to buy and sell players so i think thats another factor
3988854 we are paying for a childs complete education cost per student comes to rs 12 000 a year
3988855 many students have shown interest but cant donate enough money people can also support schooling in partnership or give a fixed amount every month
3988856 we will be handing over these kits to district supply officers mid day meal scheme officers and consumer campaigners wanting to provide unadulterated food to people
3988857 till now it used to take considerable time to make checks samples would have to be sent to special laboratories in bhuj rajkot and vadodara and it would take days for results often officers would be sought to be compromised but now all of it will be in the past
3988858 a booklet to guide consumer campaigners on how to use the kit will soon be put on the website its a very simple exercise
3988859 the states science colleges too will be given one kit free of cost so that students can learn how to check adulterated food a chemical in the kit can find out whether there is urea in milk or if castor oil has been added to groundnut oil one can easily say that with this kit as many as 1 225 mobile laboratories will be added in the state
3988860 they have given statements according to their wish we are not conducting narco analysis test where an injection is given to bring the subject in semi conscious state where he does not have control on his mind
3988861 we will get the reports from the fsl in the next few days we do not want to take any chance and are exploring all the angles
3988862 we have not zeroed in on anyone as of now but hope to get important leads soon
3988863 we had received records of more than 15 lakh cell phone numbers which were short listed by a team of experts after a lengthy and brain racking exercise we zeroed in on few suspected numbers that were contacted just before or after the blasts
3988864 we traced a simi activist from juhapura through his cell number and detained him during his interrogation he confessed to having orchestrated the serial blasts
3988865 the simi activist told us that after consultation with a fellow simi member in surat he had convened a meeting of some youths in juhapura where all participants were handed bombs wrapped in plastic bags the participants left the meeting venue with bombs wrapped in plastic bags strung on bicycles and just after two hours or so the blasts were triggered off

3988867 we saw media reports on the issue whether it was sharif khan or not is a mystery we are now in touch with interpol and trying to get some information on the person who was detained at the jeddah airport along with anees
3988868 the only way to ascertain whether this is indeed sharif khan is to get a fingerprint test carried out apart from masterminding terrorist conspiracies like haren pandya murder and isi conspiracy in gujarat khan is also wanted for several other offences red corner notices have been issued in this regard
3988869 all the lifes wisdom can be found in anagrams anagrams never lie
3988870 let me say today that all the work that council has done to date indicate that the straight through option has firstly the lowest impacts in fact almost minimal impacts on the local community
3988871 secondly it also has the highest benefit to cost ratio and thirdly it has the best business case
3988872 i am not particularly happy with the ramps for that connected option
3988873 as a state were not aware of the full details yet as a matter of fact i think the council is still forming its own views in that and when they have a proposal to put before us well give it due consideration
3988874 but i can assure you well work very closely with the brisbane city council to get good outcomes for the motoring public of brisbane
3988875 the hale street outcome is one thats been worked through
3988876 while the wii may be getting most of the attention for video game related injuries its not the only non conventional controller capable of causing some serious bodily harm and as this latest incident shows not even professional athletes are safe when detroit tigers pitcher joel zumaya was sidelined for the first three games of the american league championship series earlier this year the cause of his bad arm was kept under wraps but now the source of his ailment has finally been revealed with team president and general manager dave dombrowski telling wxyt am that too much guitar hero was to blame after zumaya gave up the game his arm improved enough to pitch in the world series of course this all could have been avoided if hed rigged up a full size guitar for guitar hero instead of rocking out for hours on end with the bundled pint sized piece of plastic that dares call itself an axe

3988884 with the tax rebate effects dissipating and the labor market weakening we should see consumer spending slow through the remainder of the year
3988885 we are in the midst of a long term trend in inflation
3988886 it wasnt a good result for us because they used a substitute team and they scored one goal as visitors

3988889 when we look at alliances in different regions we have had discussions with multiple companies in russia
3988890 at this stage there is no formal discussion going on but there was an inquiry

3988892 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3988893 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3988894 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3988895 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3988896 there is at least one silver lining and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
3988897 while none of us would have planned for the sharp downturn in the industry or the dramatically accelerated segment shifts we are seizing the opportunity
3988898 retailers are cautiously optimistic that this weekend will be a success
3988899 we have to give the customers extra deals to get them here
3988900 furniture stores became a popular destination spot during tax free weekend
3988901 we want to sweeten the deal for customers during this tough economic time
3988902 creates an extra headache for retailers because they need a bigger staff to help customers
3988903 its just condensing sales that would have been spread out throughout the month
3988904 this is exactly what i needed to push me over the edge
3988905 they feel they are producing something as safe and secure as their relationship with the lord
3988906 trying to match what the buyers need with whats being planted
3988907 we deal more on the handshake personal commitment look the grower in the eye
3988908 if you have a quality product consistently packaged dont top dress by taking the worst and putting it on the bottom all that is the way you build your name here at the auction
3988909 it is a trend that is not favorable to us
3988910 the possibility of a continued decline in sales tax revenue should serve as a reminder that while we want to get each district the best possible facility some extras might have to be scaled back
3988911 if we can save a roof today more than likely we will not have to rebuild a building in five years

3988920 antes de emprender un proyecto siempre trato de comprender el contexto general de impregnarme de la civilizaci n involucrada y de aprender de menos los rudimentos del idioma s lo entonces estoy en condiciones de alcanzar con una gran libertad lo que cartier bresson caracteriza como actitud decisiva del fot grafo toma su fotograf a con un ojo muy abierto que observa el mundo a trav s del visor mientras que el otro cerrado mira el interior de su alma

3988923 it was a professional display from the players and im delighted that weve opened the season with two victories and two clean sheets they are well organised and it was always going to be tough but the second goal came at a stage where they were having a decent spell and killed the game off for us
3988924 the lads gave it a good go in the second half but birmingham had too much quality for us
3988925 the adoption is now advanced all the government is waiting for is madonna to forward the petition of adoption formalities then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life
3988926 madonna has not made an attempt to adopt this baby earlier this year or now
3988927 there is no truth to this rumor its an old one wasnt true then or now madonna is starting her tour in a week
3988928 this is an in depth detailed examination thats beyond what has been broadcast in terms of these typical type of biographies
3988929 we created a new sesamestreet org that kids and parents can enjoy together and that also encourages preschoolers to explore and learn on their own
3988930 just like the tv show we put the famous muppets center stage where they directly address their young audience and guide them through a structured play space that was designed to be safe friendly and easy to use the entire online channel was redesigned to bring an updated broadband experience to their newest generation as well as long standing fans of the show
3988931 magnani caruso was integral to the overall strategy and direction of this project
3988932 they helped define and prioritize our requirements and designed a user experience that truly brings sesame street to life on this new site
3988933 dat was ik niet hoor dat was mijn lichaam en dat is alleen maar vel met een spook erin
3988934 i will be exalted among the heathen i will be exalted in the earth
3988935 this is dangerous because were doing just enough to lose right now
3988936 thats not good we have to start doing the things that it takes to win
3988937 its kind of like a day off but not really
3988938 it just kind of gives the legs a break trying to get back instead of overworking them and trying to do too much
3988939 i didnt know when i was coming back but im happy that im back here now im just ready to get after it again
3988940 we had seven quality at bats wednesday in 32 plate appearances we have to swing at better pitches thats pathetic
3988941 when you have seven quality at bats in 32 plate appearances youre not going to beat anybody much less a first place team
3988942 they get excited for different reasons here in china it seems like
3988943 theyre quite sad you didnt make the ball over the net
3988944 on a double fault youre like ok double faults happen
3988945 but theyre like oh no how bad for the guy so its actually quite a unique experience its a different cultural experience in a way honestly i enjoy it
3988946 the longer the point went you know the happier they were
3988947 sometimes they get quite excited during the point which is quite distracting for us
3988948 but its very difficult to explain to them in chinese during the point we are really fighting hard to play each ball and you hear such loud applause during it and you kind of get confused
3988949 its just hard coming off the individual competition you fence so hard and you only have so many days later
3988950 im not looking for excuses but we werent fencing up to our potential
3988951 ive never seen anything like it but ill take it
3988952 thats the sign of a good team taking advantage of your opportunities
3988953 the guy throws strikes he moves it around the zone
3988954 his command was good again tonight thats what moehler has to do and thats what hes been doing
3988955 i want to go out there and give us a chance to win
3988956 we dont have a lot of wins when im out there but i dont think ive had too many starts i dont think where we didnt have a chance to win
3988957 i did say that the olympic games will help china open up and reform better
3988958 china is developing quickly people enjoy more freedom and they have a lot to say if you ask the ordinary chinese on the street they will say the same
3988959 you have to believe the majority of the people otherwise you are misled
3988960 everybody can see that the olympic games are a great platform people are optimistic about their own future
3988961 i feel people come here to be critical that doesnt mean we are not fulfilling our promises
3988962 i say the games will open up the horizon about china
3988963 we are very pleased with how the organisers are putting up a great sports event
3988964 these tournaments are such a fine line between in and out
3988965 you walk that line and it goes one way or the other and sometimes you just need a call here or a call there to sort of push you in the right direction
3988966 i want people to know were not far away from doing well in tournaments like this
3988967 were getting close and i think with a few fortunate bounces in this tournament we would have been through to the quarterfinals sitting pretty
3988968 im very disappointed with the way things ended but i want people to know were getting close and when the world cup comes around i hope we do great
3988969 playing the way we did does help but in the end it is the results that matter in these tournaments and there are times i think i wouldnt have minded if we played terrible and got three wins
3988970 there are a lot of things we can improve at the international level but were going in the right direction
3988971 you have to understand them rather than ask them to understand you you need to understand what kind of situation they are in and what you can ask of them
3988972 you start with the easy things and make it more difficult and repeat and repeat thats another kind of patience you have to have otherwise you cant do it
3988973 the biggest reason i did that is my eye capacity when you get old you cannot judge the distance at high speed and your riding gets slower and slower
3988974 i wasnt qualified as a rider because of my age
3988975 if that makes me a little bit more famous than the others then thats not so bad
3988976 if somebody hears what i am doing or if what i am doing helps to motivate him or her that will be nice

3988978 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd

3988980 do you want me to go play baseball the son asked
3988981 i did everything possible but i was never home and thats what hurt
3988982 as close as we were i didnt feel like i was there enough but if i was there it would have happened anyway because god has a date for everybody
3988983 getting hurt in the first game after all that rehabbing was a shock he said
3988984 and then my dad i couldnt get my mind off him
3988985 i dont know if im going to end up doing what im supposed to do like i did in boston in the last year
3988986 but like anything else with petey mets general manager omar minaya said
3988987 the arm is great the velocity is fine so far he hasnt had command the walks the home runs are because of command and the only way he gets that back is if he gets on the mound and pitches its going to come
3988988 if hes healthy i dont think hes ready to walk away said minaya adding that whether martinez returns to the mets in 2009 depends on what he shows down the stretch
3988989 im not planning to go away from the game if im healthy
3988990 im only 36 ill be 37 next year his birthday is oct 25 but one of the things im thinking about is my family i lost my dad how long will it be before you lose another one you love like your mom its difficult to think about somebody else
3988991 if you take part of this arm that i have you will go pretty far this arm pitched for a long time
3988992 for me hes accomplished the goals of what we wanted him to do minaya said
3988993 he gave us respectability in the marketplace he promoted the brand we dont get
3988994 youre the hope that my heart is holding on to
3988995 when the european parliament and some members of the united states congress called for the games to be sent elsewhere
3988996 the political maneuvering backfired and beijing instead may have picked up another 10 votes from ioc delegates said mario pescante an italian member
3988997 its handling of every aspect of the games including construction of new olympic arenas the treatment of foreign visitors and reporters and the political climate in which the games are held will be closely monitored by the world
3988998 the ioc and the world at large should make clear that granting the olympics to china is not meant as a reward
3988999 the olympic authorities must insist that no journalists athletes or spectators seeking to attend the games be denied entry to china or find their activities once there restricted even if their political views are abhorrent to the chinese government international media should have unrestricted access in covering preparation for the games and all areas of chinese life during the olympics including human rights and chinas criminal justice system
3989000 must also insist on the right to monitor labor practices at olympic construction sites as well as to oversee security measures leading up to the games
3989001 do you agree with the continuation of the process of change led by president evo morales ayma and vice president lvaro garc a linera
3989002 thanks to the income of the nationalized gas industry in little over two years urban unemployment has decreased from 8 15 percent to 7 66 percent the minimum salary has increased from 440 bolivianos to 577 7 the foreign debt decreased from 4 94 to 2 9 billion for the first time in decades there is no fiscal deficit and we add that the president vice president parliamentarians and ministers have lowered their salaries and increased those of the health workers teachers and workers in general

3989004 you will be astonished to know about the activities of dr afia
3989005 we know that you are connected to higher ups but do not make an issue out of your daughters disappearance
3989006 i call her the grey lady because she is almost a ghost a spectre whose cries and screams continues to haunt those who heard her
3989007 she rented a post office box to help a former resident of baltimore named majid khan alleged al qaeda suspect to help establish his us identity
3989008 we know that you are connected to higher ups but do not make an issue out of her daughters disappearance
3989009 i think everyone was shocked to hear that the americans were holding this woman at bagram in afghanistan from the information coming through i am told she is being held in exactly the same conditions as the men and has absolutely no privacy when it comes to toilet and shower facilities
3989010 this would never happen to a western woman and it shows just how women are viewed by the us military there is even a suggestion she has been mo lested and se x ually abused by her captors we need to demand the truth
3989011 i was released on humanitarian grounds mercifully my treatment was good respectful and decent although still terrifying
3989012 i remembered moazzam telling me about the womans screams and how he first imagined they could be from his wife in truth i thought maybe he had just been listening to a tape recorder as part of a form of mental torture
3989013 however we now know the screams came from a woman who has been held in bagram for some years and without compromising anyone we can also reveal from impeccable sources that her prison number is 650
3989014 this information has been enough to scramble the pakistan media into action by demanding the return of this woman to her homeland immediately
3989015 prisoner 650 is just the tip of a very nasty iceberg of human rights abuses illegal detentions and rendition flights it is a shameful episode in pakistans history which must be put right
3989016 i wonder how can we hand over our sister to the non muslims for their illegal trial by men whose history is full of rape and other abuses to prisoners
3989017 i began to hear the chilling screams of a woman next door why have you got a woman next door they told me there was no woman but i was unconvinced those screams echoed through my worst nightmares for a long time and i later learned in guantanamo from other prisoners that they had heard the screams too
3989018 while on the run one not only confirmed he had heard a womans screams but said he had seen her
3989019 my story made international headlines front page pictures and major stories on tv but there has not been one word not one paragraph about prisoner 650 the grey lady of bagram a murderous detention facility under control of the u s military and intelligence services
3989020 all like the grey lady of bagram have been illegally abducted by secretive intelligence agencies they began disappearing in 2001 during the so called war on terror
3989021 weve always seen him probably running some cup races this year but thats not related necessarily to running the whole thing next year
3989022 what we kind of look at for him is when hes ready and the time is right well go
3989023 theres a good possibility of something like that nothings been ironed out completely on what were going to do but its been talked about a lot well just have to see
3989024 w ere hoping they rule in our favor because i think that any zoning overturned its the beginning of a lot of people doing the same thing we think our zoning is fair
3989025 sams family is jewish lindsay has learned a lot about judaism from sam and admires its beliefs
3989026 no one can doctor or misconstrue what has been said
3989027 those who have allowed themselves the luxury of being present with patients as they are dying come away realizing in a whole new way that there is only one divine physician and it is he alone who sets the timetables of our lives
3989028 how it was what he said how he died i want to know all about it
3989029 concerning this sect it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere
3989030 you will be hated by all nations because of my name
3989031 woe to you when all men speak well of you
3989032 if they have called the head of the house beelzebul how much more will they malign the members of his household
3989033 we are his people the sheep of his pasture enter his gates with thanksgiving
3989034 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me
3989035 whether our god gives to us or takes everything from us we will follow him
3989036 brother we dont want to judge but we cant help but be curious how can you in good conscience put those chemicals referring to the coke in your body
3989037 even though we had three children our family wasnt really fully complete and we knew there was such a great need in china
3989038 libby was found in a box outside of a police station when she was only a baby god led us to her and we got her from an orphanage when she was 1 year old
3989039 its that god had blessed us so much we wanted to bless another child
3989040 starting over with a baby at almost 40 was a challenge
3989041 but weve received more of a blessing than shell ever get from us
3989042 we like to say that theres international conflict every night in our house
3989043 when we get together its like a gathering of the united nations
3989044 we wanted them to see the environment libby was from to have an even greater understanding
3989045 my children have learned how to love others in a deeper way its been an enrichment to the whole health of our family
3989046 its a rocky road there are a lot of attachment issues they have from being in an orphanage
3989047 it made it difficult for her to trust us at first
3989048 and she brings an incredible amount of joy to our lives joy we never thought possible
3989049 we had teenage twins and i thought we were done my wife didnt though
3989050 shed been convinced for years and i finally saw beyond my selfishness
3989051 the biggest blessing is just to see this child who when we met her was basically a human being simply existing barely existing to see her bloom like a flower shes becoming the person who she is the way god fashioned her to be
3989052 he has used us in a small way both to rescue her and give her hope for the future
3989053 and he thought thats what you do to get brothers your mom does paperwork
3989054 when joshua was little he equated his birth with us getting him from china
3989055 the children have all been simply brothers and sisters from the beginning
3989056 how they became parts of the family has not been relevant to the fact that they are all equal parts while we hear questions from time to time the questions have little sticking power because they have been answered from the beginning both with words and with relationships
3989057 joshua asked me that once when he was 6 or 7
3989058 and i told him that there were parents in china who could not provide the care their children needed so they loved their children enough to put them in a safe place until their new parents could come get them
3989059 i have told them that their birth mothers were like moses mom who loved them enough to put them in a safe place so they could be found cared for and raised to love and serve god
3989060 were all humans arent we every human life is worth the same and worth saving
3989061 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3989062 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3989063 is to inspire promising young men to become vigorous advocates of the american ideal caring men dedicated to serving others dynamic role models for african american boys losing hope and leaders with the integrity to stand for real solutions regardless of prevailing sentiment
3989064 not what we going to be careers but im concerned about who we going to be
3989065 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3989066 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3989067 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3989068 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3989069 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3989070 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3989071 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3989072 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3989073 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3989074 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3989075 i broker domains every day in the nfl betting industry
3989076 im so happy for gagnier fitzgibbon finally an award for the right person
3989077 well keep everyone abreast of continued new nfl betting product releases
3989078 this was very hard for tom everyone recognized that paula has been a disaster but to his credit he wanted her to have an exit with honor
3989079 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3989080 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3989081 i want to know the truth about god jesus who shot jfk life darwin all of it

3989086 so bene che il primo servizio che posso rendere alla chiesa e allumanit quello della preghiera chi crede non perde mai la speranza
3989087 sono stati giorni di serena distensione ha detto durante i quali non ho cessato di ricordare al signore quanti si affidano alle mie preghiere
3989088 e sono veramente tantissimi quelli che mi scrivono chiedendo di pregare per loro mi manifestano le loro gioie ma anche le loro preoccupazioni i loro progetti di vita ma pure i problemi familiari e di lavoro le attese e le speranze che portano in cuore insieme alle angustie connesse alle incertezze che lumanit sta vivendo in questo momento posso assicurare che per tutti e per ciascuno ho un ricordo specialmente nella quotidiana celebrazione della santa messa e nella recita del santo rosario
3989089 chi prega non perde mai la speranza anche quando venisse a trovarsi in situazioni difficili e persino umanamente disperate questo ci insegna la sacra scrittura e questo testimonia la storia della chiesa quanti esempi in effetti potremmo recare di situazioni in cui stata proprio la preghiera a sostenere il cammino dei santi e del popolo cristiano
3989090 apparentemente le loro esistenze potrebbero essere ritenute una sconfitta ma proprio nel loro martirio risplende il fulgore dellamore che vince le tenebre dellegoismo e dellodio a san massimiliano kolbe vengono attribuite le seguenti parole che egli avrebbe pronunciato nel pieno furore della persecuzione nazista lodio non una forza creativa lo solo lamore e dellamore fu eroica prova la generosa offerta che egli fece di s in cambio di un suo compagno di prigionia offerta culminata nella morte nel bunker della fame il 14 agosto del 1941
3989091 testimoni che riuscirono a fuggire dallorribile massacro raccontarono che teresa benedetta della croce mentre vestita dellabito carmelitano avanzava cosciente verso la morte si distingueva per il suo comportamento pieno di pace e per il suo atteggiamento sereno e per il comportamento calmo e attento alle necessit di tutti
3989092 il suo eroico atto damore e la morte di martire ha detto salutando i fedeli polacchi sar sempre segno del trionfo della potenza di dio e della nobilt delluomo sullimmensit del male
3989093 ave maria fu lultima invocazione sulle labbra di san massimiliano maria kolbe mentre porgeva il braccio a colui che lo uccideva con uniniezione di acido fenico commovente costatare come il ricorso umile e fiducioso alla madonna sia sempre sorgente di coraggio e di serenit mentre ci prepariamo a celebrare la solennit dellassunzione che una delle ricorrenze mariane pi care alla tradizione cristiana rinnoviamo il nostro affidamento a colei che dal cielo veglia con amore materno su di noi in ogni momento
3989094 in einem umfeld das in deutschland und international durch schlechte nachrichten und eine zunehmende unsicherheit ber die weitere entwicklung der konjunktur gepr gt ist halte ich dies f r ein erfreuliches ergebnis
3989095 there are those who wish to use children and schools as social engineers with a view to creating a different society but we should not even be trying to do such things
3989096 children need to be nurtured educated and cared for not thrown into the frontline of social reform muddled thinking is guaranteeing failure for the noble aspirations we all commonly hold for the education of the young
3989097 simply do not have the contact time to create behaviours and attitudes within children they are not and cannot be social engineers and social workers and surrogate parents as well as subject teachers all rolled into one
3989098 for everyone with gas prices increasing every other day this card lures us with 2 cash back on travel and 1 cash back everywhere else including costco

3989108 we budgeted for higher costs but we havent budgeted for this level of increase
3989109 our members have said this is one of the more difficult seasons they can remember
3989110 we use a lot of gas not only on our properties but also prospecting
3989111 were still losing money on the gas but it helps out a bit
3989112 for the most part people have been pretty understanding about it they understand that were pretty heavy users of gas
3989113 its our philosophy to offer really fair affordable and competitive prices

3989368 to be completely honest i despise running hate it competing in these insane 100 mile running races all weekend long and all the training that goes with it is utter torture
3989369 that said i continue to do it because i hate spending time with my family a thousand times more than competing in this ridiculous sport
3989370 my strict training method consists of running about 20 to 30 miles a day in preparation for my weekend races that take place twice a month
3989371 i pretend to need total concentration while running so i ask my family not to call me
3989372 do you want to play guitar hero or go kill some ants
3989373 it keeps him happy he sure seems to love it
3989374 like most of the races this one is in the desert about a million degrees i usually puke on average about ten times a day from dehydration and exhaustion but that doesnt deter me not even the hallucinations can stop me its sooooo much better than watching dance recitals and soccer games
3989375 im motivated by that not seeing my family high that many runners get after logging in a few miles on the pavement it makes all the leg cramps eroded cartilage third degree sunburn pants crapping and the intense stabbing pain that jets up through my spine every time i begin to move my feet all worth it
3989376 i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can if i can do that ill be fine
3989377 the most important thing is being able to separate the two events and just move on ive trained for it im used to it the biggest part for me in the psychological part
3989378 what a great way to finish with a gold medal and a world record
3989379 for us to break the record by so far is amazing i really look back to sitting back and cheering for the aussies
3989380 i did my best and ran out of room at the end
3989381 it definitely gives me more motivation im a little bit tired and i have a full day to recover
3989382 i cant believe it after the relay i could have sunk but i told myself that after all these years of hard work i cant let myself go down my legs were shaking at the start i was really tense just like the other seven guys
3989383 its a new generation and its now time to step aside they did a great job im from the previous generation
3989384 i was so calm that i think i could have seen each face in this venue

3989392 following conflict with the anti wind group the leader of the group is in prison
3989393 i think that the wind on jeju island is owned by jejus people the wind impacts the people wind is very close to the people both in history and culture the dialect here is very short and strong because of the wind so the wind has deeply impacted the local people also when people make houses here they think only of the wind because they need protection from such a strong wind and because the houses need to be made sturdy enough to withstand strong storms
3989394 the image of wind in jeju island is not good its very negative but wind companies think of wind as very positive so theres a kind of historical and cultural inequality between the wind companies and the local population
3989395 i cant even afford to hardly drive to work paying 80 bucks a week in gas

3989431 i just go on stage and do im used to it
3989432 its more than just the movie one of the cut scenes from the movie was the jitterbugs
3989433 the four characters trying to find their way going through all that hard stuff
3989434 i have to be afraid of everything and im not normally
3989435 its amazing the amount of families that come through with their kids and buy stuff for their kids that they couldnt get at christmas
3989436 we started out by helping pads in wheaton and grew to the six organizations we help now
3989437 its the families the little children that are put out on the street thats the thing that bothers me the most
3989438 im inspired every time i go by a church in the morning and i see people stumbling out of it because they spent the night there
3989439 its unbelievable that in this day and age we still have people who are homeless
3989440 the problem with homelessness is that you cant get out of it its almost like a catch 22
3989441 we made more money in the rain there last year than we did the previous year
3989442 some of its educational some of it is to truly help kids understand what theater and arts are about
3989443 shes been dedicated for 23 years now its just time to move on to doing other things
3989444 i do not think either one of the craigs like the way things in the village are going
3989445 shes been a model of dedication and leadership and caring thats what i see
3989446 never forget that you are here to meet the needs of the people of hanover park
3989447 this year was a huge step in the growth process that weve had because were reaching out to so many different age groups and ethnic groups
3989448 the addition of gospelfest is really a great event to add this year because of the interest in the performers and bands that will be taking part on the main stage
3989449 karl was a truly unique individual who willingly shared with me his knowledge of the chicago dental society and provided counsel and guidance whenever needed
3989450 his great humor storytelling and ability to send me to the thesaurus will always be remembered and cherished
3989451 it was either incorporate or be swallowed up by streamwood and forever lose their identity
3989452 from camelot to metropolis a chronical of ontarioville and hanover park illinois
3989453 i look at this as a new beginning a celebration of who we are and what we represent
3989454 this must be an age of restoration restoring the natural resources of this country so that the younger generation will not inherit a country in which the air is filled with smog the water is polluted and our parks are desolate because we didnt do the right planning
3989455 for many years people looked at us as a bedroom community but were continuing to build and improve
3989456 weve evolved into a community of great diversity a place where people can afford to bring their families
3989457 i think the cost is justified to bring some pride to our community
3989458 yes i know it is quite a project right now but it is starting to come together now
3989459 some people aspire to be something else but she cherished being a mother
3989460 she was truly an awesome person i was always totally amazed by her humanity and grace
3989461 she was a matriarch of so many things in st charles the school delnor community hospital and the city
3989462 she was able to further the community to be generous to the community and at the same time she was modest and caring
3989463 we budgeted for higher costs but we havent budgeted for this level of increase
3989464 our members have said this is one of the more difficult seasons they can remember
3989465 we use a lot of gas not only on our properties but also prospecting
3989466 were still losing money on the gas but it helps out a bit
3989467 for the most part people have been pretty understanding about it they understand that were pretty heavy users of gas
3989468 its our philosophy to offer really fair affordable and competitive prices
3989469 thats always been important to us but its even more important now
3989470 my gut says to keep it tight watch your costs and do good work
3989471 what direction does each of us want society to go and how
3989472 youre not going all political on me are you im not
3989473 no themes are so human as those that reflect for us out
3989474 were going to have so many empty stores its ridiculous
3989475 it was unlike anything the village has experienced in recent history
3989476 at the end of the day it wasnt in the budget and that budget was approved by the entire village board
3989477 where did the money go i want to know what the hell went on
3989478 i want to know exactly how much money should have been in there with accrued interest how much money is there now and if in fact there is a deficit exactly how much it is
3989479 we dont want projections we dont want guesstimates we ought to know to the penny exactly where its at
3989480 we have never been given any kind of accounting or tally sheet that represents where we are how much money was in the ssa
3989481 the board of trustees has never been provided anything more than year end summaries of what was spent that particular year we havent been given a formal report about what money is left
3989482 if we were doing our jobs in terms of reporting and keeping track of whats going on we would have known about this a long time ago
3989483 is the village board to blame for not watching this more closely there are those who would say we are and ultimately that buck stops with me
3989484 if somebody is giving us bad information then we are going to make bad decisions
3989485 we are not suddenly going to discover it the money in some bank account we forgot about
3989486 its gone really what we need to focus on in my mind it isnt so much where the money went but what are we going to do about it now
3989487 were going to use the information we received from those stakeholders and the information we receive at the meting to put together a preliminary plan
3989488 currently the industrial market based upon the expansion of ohare is dictating redevelopment from smaller industrial and warehouse facilities into larger logistic and airfreight facilities
3989489 if its still as promising as it is now well go on to phase two in 2009
3989490 eat sleep and swim thats all i can do get some calories into my system and try to recover the best i can
3989491 its been a chronic problem weve had investigators in and out of the facility for quite some time
3989492 the important thing here is everybody is held to the law with regard to the treatment of animals
3989493 i am satisfied i wont be staying up all night worrying about buses
3989494 students wont be on the bus for 50 minutes or an hour this year
3989495 we are starting out with a great bank of drivers
3989496 what we do need are powerful reliable communications that help manage costs and enable the nbc olympics team to do their jobs most efficiently
3989497 the company is enabling greater mobility by allowing calls made to an employees extension to also ring on their cell phone changing locations and remaining mobile is now possible and easier to ensure streamlined flexibility
3989498 maar de eerste bevindingen zijn voldoende hoopgevend om er mee verder te gaan
3989499 indicators that were meeting our goal of creating lifelong learners
3989500 at the heart of it whats most important is the kind of experiences students have in the classroom
3989501 these scores reflect a work ethic of students who are encouraged to do their best and strive for excellence
3989502 while we are certainly most proud of our students accomplishments
3989503 we recognize that this achievement has been a collaborative effort involving talented and hard working students outstanding and dedicated teachers and supportive and encouraging parents
3989504 we remember being told by lowes that they would be a good partnership and that they wouldnt be an eyesore or cause any kind of problem
3989505 they were going to go over and above to meet our needs
3989506 there are several trees that need to be replaced from the original installation throughout the site
3989507 the contractor is aware and will be replacing this material this fall under better planting conditions
3989508 nothing personal bill but i think especially at this time when were looking at cracking down on landlords and the condition of our rental units in the city i believe the entire board of the aurora housing authority needs to be replaced
3989509 im not saying its any one individual but its obviously not working there is nobody that can look at that and say that organization is working properly it is a huge problem in this city
3989510 right now theyre a warehouse full of low income renters and theyre doing nothing to help those people succeed and exit the system
3989511 the conditions some of these folks live in are appalling
3989512 rentals are not a blight to this community and they never have been especially with our scattered site houses
3989513 you wouldnt be able to pick our home out of any neighborhood we have them in because we dont want them to stand out
3989514 we attempt to get our tenants involved in local social services but the constant turnover rate we face and our funding levels makes that difficult
3989515 negative impact they have on our school district police department and community and as a whole
3989516 they dont understand their role and as far as im concerned theyre there to pick up a 75 check twice a month
3989517 maybe they got involved to help but they quickly got in over their heads and havent bothered to get out
3989518 this is an excellent board every single one of them is very involved in the community and the housing authority
3989519 theyre all aurora residents and are very involved in the city they live in
3989520 were making policy based on only receiving 81 percent of our funding and that has always been a concern
3989521 i dont know any other entity that could operate as well as we do with a 19 percent cut in funding
3989522 i agree with lawrence and share many of his concerns about the housing authority
3989523 but that is a discussion we all need to have for a decision that we all need to make that decision cannot be made by one person
3989524 they are forcing me to lie because they want to convict kenny smith
3989525 they told me if i dont give them the testimony they want me to testify to theyll revoke my plea agreement
3989526 avec des personnes qui sa connaissance ont des ant c dents judiciaires ou sont des membres dun gang de rue
3989527 mccains problem is that his campaign is full of washington lobbyist types
3989528 this is such a perversion of what parents are supposed to be
3989529 daniel and andrea kelly have inverted the maxim in which a child kills his parents and throws himself on the mercy of the court claiming that he is an orphan
3989530 according to the investigation the van was at fault and violated traffic rules
3989531 this evening when i get together with them i will certainly be talking about the fact that reno was just named a top adventure town by national geographic and we will make sure they have that information to take back and tell their potential clients
3989532 this type of national recognition will be very useful for us when we are out of market recruiting skilled workers this helps tell the story that reno is not just a gaming town but also has skilled jobs a wonderful lifestyle and is a place where people want to settle down
3989533 not only do they have the action they have a plan
3989534 reno and tahoe are making a serious joint bid for the 2018 olympics but the smaller sister city has enough chops to merit consideration in its own right parked next to the aspen fringed mount rose wilderness reno has a wealth of hospitality jobs a refurbished downtown and a new 1 5 million whitewater park all reasons enough to stick around
3989535 im proud that i am georgian and they hate us because we are georgian
3989536 i should imagine that we should have some sort of indication by early next week what the situation is
3989537 the crews elected to be involved in some passive work rather than be stood down
3989538 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
3989539 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
3989540 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
3989541 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
3989542 ill be there to tell our story and do so in a fashion that we build good relationships
3989543 part of it will be to rekindle the relationships that jim vanden huevel built before he passed away
3989544 there are actually more summer sport voting members of the olympic selection committees than there are winter voting members so our fate will be decided by a lot of the people that will be in beijing
3989545 people can donate anything from a buck to 100 bucks or any amount they want
3989546 if the pigeons want to add their own additional emphasis well by all means they should feel welcome
3989547 i was informed that he was going to get help for a problem with prescription drug pain killers
3989548 for several days the vice chairman paul biane was running the board and i was running the 1st district office there was no interruption in county service
3989549 supervisor biane considers bill to be a longtime friend and longtime political ally
3989550 he called on the assessor to respond or resign so he can focus on getting well if he truly is having a drug addiction problem
3989551 i was led to believe that he was cured and was never aware that he had any type of relapse
3989552 i never had any evidence or observation to believe otherwise
3989553 all he has to say as to the allegation of illegal substance is i dont do that
3989554 if not he needs to say something that explains why he should not be viewed in a negative light because of the allegations
3989555 spanish valley nearly single handedly makes up the states wine industry and competently so stumbling block to the recreation center comes from county attorney
3989556 our tribal complex building held up but most of the tribal members in the local area are without power and some are still without power
3989557 when the ioc looks the other way at claims like these it does so at its peril

3989590 this particular platform is more about how it develops in the future

3989592 the helio acquisition is transformative for us the addition of a post paid platform outstanding data services and compelling handsets will enable us to offer more value to our entire customer base prepaid hybrid and post paid alike
3989593 we have seen our prepaid usage be fairly stable throughout the first half of the year and right in line with what we projected for the year if not slightly better so while we did come into the year with that mid single digit decrease we have seen very slight decreases in usage which is a normal trend as you come out of the first quarter with a lot of new gross ads into the second quarter it s very consistent with what we modeled and very stable right now
3989594 there was no distress no sadness she was her bubbly self we talked we laughed and we were making plans she was telling me how she would be coming home sooner than she expected and certainly would be home for christmas which was her favorite time of the year

3989600 set the tent ablaze in a failed attempt to cover up her crimes against herself
3989601 lavena johnson was raped beaten and murdered by someone on a military base in balad iraq and the army doesnt want you to know about it army officers most especially didnt want her parents to know about it so they concocted the suicide story informing them that their daughter had shot herself in the head in her barracks
3989602 they said my daughter shot herself in the head shes right handed and the bullet hole was on the left side of her head
3989603 horrific photographs from the autopsy that clearly showed the extent of their daughters injuries
3989604 it proved that the original black and white photos of lavenas body originally sent to them had been doctored also on the disk were damning sketches of the crime scene that gave her parents further information contradicting the armys statements
3989605 but im finding out that very few people do as compared to jamie leigh jones theres a couple of big differences as to why one womans story is virtually unknown while the other was covered by brian ross and abc news jamie leigh jones is white shes alive to tell her tale lavena johnson is black shes been dead now for over three years

3989612 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3989613 we do not want there to be any potential misunderstanding or miscalculation
3989614 i really do believe that the russians understand that pushing the envelope here would have significant consequences for russias standing in the international system
3989615 that may have been the product of the fact that the europeans have more leverage with the russians on georgia than does the united states
3989616 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected its leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbors than what it thinks about u s policy

3989672 in the literary world we seek to heighten public awareness about the online casinos industry and how it works this is absolutely essential for those in the academic literary and research fields
3989673 because the work that has been done in the online casinos literary area has been huge
3989674 were releasing chrest stillsons work online in a weeks time
3989675 we stocked our shelves with double the normal number of first editions for this major online casinos biographical novel release
3989676 and we expect to sell out very fast phylis wadmans online casinos book brought hundreds of pre sale orders and numerous bulk order requests so the question of whether or not well sell out is moot
3989677 but were doing it to make sure no unauthorized copies get resold we want to avoid plagiarism and pirating as much as possible furthermore this will be our new procedure for future releases by author chantell grenko who has pledged support for this system
3989678 with the release of trudgeon tuckes new online casinos book were going to see record traffic levels
3989679 i fully expect a sequel to be release within six months
3989680 typically we see interest wane a year after the initial release so it is important to stay on schedule and release subsequent books at pique points of public interest
3989681 i think barnhouse hendrikss new docu novel leads readers astray there is too much focus on making the fictional characters function whereas more attention should have been paid to the facts
3989682 i like the fact that it reaches out to those outside of the literary world this is a wise decision and proves a good way to educate others about new things
3989683 i think teaching this story will be highly educational for my online casinos students irregardless of what critics believe
3989684 heck if we always listened to critics nothing would be sold they serve a purpose but i leave the fact checking to qualified historians and researchers
3989685 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3989686 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3989687 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3989688 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3989689 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3989690 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3989691 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3989692 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3989693 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3989694 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3989695 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3989696 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3989697 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3989698 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3989699 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3989700 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3989701 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3989702 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3989703 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3989704 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3989705 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3989706 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3989707 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3989708 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3989709 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3989710 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3989711 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3989712 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3989713 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3989714 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3989715 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3989716 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3989717 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3989718 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3989719 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3989720 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3989721 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3989722 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3989723 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3989724 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3989725 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3989726 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3989727 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3989728 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3989729 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3989730 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3989731 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3989732 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3989733 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3989734 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3989735 if they cant read and they cant do math its going to be tough on them
3989736 in todays mobile society family history is a new subject to so many kids
3989737 but in last summers library reading program at the carver branch children from daycare programs to sixth grade were really curious they were asking questions about their family history
3989738 alices workbook is just what my students need to develop an interest in family history while using skills such as reading writing organizing information and finally presenting a speech on their findings
3989739 it was a multicultural class in florida because parents from japan mexico thailand and vietnam came to work in pensacolas port
3989740 they liked the subject especially the unit on food from different countries as part of tradition
3989741 and how far back they can fill in their ancestry becomes a competition
3989742 we are always looking for something to do with our grandchildren
3989743 we had to get permission from the principal to let him bring in a weapon

3989754 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3989755 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3989756 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3989757 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3989758 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3989759 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3989760 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3989761 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3989762 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

3989768 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3989769 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3989770 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3989771 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3989772 thats why we now find we are in a position to cut interest rates
3989773 we set out to bring inflation back within a target range and are confident we are on that path

3989793 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3989794 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3989795 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos

3989799 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
3989800 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
3989801 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
3989802 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

3989805 we overestimate the risk to society and we underestimate our own risk
3989806 it is the other persons behaviour that needs to be controlled not mine
3989807 human attention in the best of circumstances is a fluid but fragile entity
3989808 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3989809 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3989810 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3989811 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3989812 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3989813 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3989814 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3989815 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3989816 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3989817 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3989818 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3989819 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3989820 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3989821 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3989822 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3989823 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3989824 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3989825 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3989826 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3989827 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3989828 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3989829 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3989830 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3989831 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3989832 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3989833 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3989834 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3989835 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3989836 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3989837 since the essentials of this school have already been explained in detail in the epistles letters of rennyo there should be no one who disrupts the teaching
3989838 just as i have acquired shinjin from the epistles each member in local provinces should attain shinjin from the epistles
3989839 crap the pipes just broke wheres the shut off valve who should i call how much money is this going to cost me
3989840 shilpa and i were to co host bigg boss and after being inmates at bigg boss and big brother wed have made a nice pair but unfortunately this film where i play a psycho required immense preparation my character is like many animals rolled into one sometimes hes a hyena sometimes he becomes a rabbit i avidly watched the national geographic channel for weeks to understand and imbibe animal traits this is the most complex role of my career and thank god for my co stars all of us danny saab mithunda and of course imran are one big boys club we work and party together and women are not allowed in fact ive adopted danny saab as my guru theres no rivalry no one upmanship all of us have well defined very rugged and sporty parts
3989841 the tools for entry to new media are not as much of a barrier
3989842 you need airwaves to broadcast but you can build a website online and do something on your own in the new media world if you look at what
3989843 well have the stories and locations where they occured but we hope to have walking tours on the website that you can download and customize for your ipod and then take them out for a walk
3989844 it would be great for us to partner with local atlanta organizations that promote walking and biking like the atlanta bicycle campaign and then we could co host events with them and get people outside that way
3989845 so all the girls would fall in love with me
3989846 wow you are so lucky do you just taste wine all day
3989847 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3989848 hes young not a washington player all about change and of course its virginia
3989849 not an attempt to escort the clintons off the national stage
3989850 it is not a slight against clinton it means you get a couple of heavy hitters on the same night and that can only be good for barack obama and the party
3989851 were already experiencing that in traffic congestion in schools and in our crowded coastal areas
3989852 if you look up meat in the merriam webster dictionary it says a solid food
3989853 the animal meat paradigm doesnt own those words roast and deli similarly the dairy industry doesnt own the word milk
3989854 im not making fake meat being fake anything implies being lesser i sell grain meat

3989856 unsolicited statements provided by cruz as well as apparent blood on his clothing caused officers to believe that he was involved in the attack
3989857 all your nerves go stupid when i tried to step on it it was a step on a non existent leg
3989858 i know i was feeling down after the relay but i didnt want to get beaten i have been working years and years when i looked at the board i just thought wow i did it its a great joy to be here now i want to enjoy the moment
3989859 it was really fortunate to be in the first heat with britta steffen and libby trickett and have such a good heat to judge myself off of
3989860 i probably would have liked to have gone a bit faster than that
3989861 it felt comfortable so hopefully i can be good for tomorrow and bring something else out
3989862 i was not thinking about winning two gold medals at two consecutive olympic games i was focusing on these olympic games what i wanted to do was show my best performance here in beijing
3989863 i used to be so thin but after i had my kids i just never lost the baby weight
3989864 but you can put pineapple in jello weve done it
3989865 dc taxpayers would be outraged to know a building that the city government spent millions on has been left sitting vacant
3989866 the building was supposed to consolidate five public safety functions into one building to increase efficiency of the police department a year ago the fenty administration changed their minds on the plans so the multimillion dollar building is just sitting there empty the city spent an additional 1 million for the plans to renovate and has to date paid more than 6 5 million in rent
3989867 by the end of the week the office of property management will request someone else take over the lease and option to purchase the vacant building
3989868 you guysre just stumblin from one musical disaster to another aint ya

3989872 its one of those dreams you have as a child in america
3989873 ive been working for this for the last eight years especially the last four and to time everything right on one day is an accomplishment of its own
3989874 lance lives a life im not at all familiar with
3989875 no movie stars or million dollar bank accounts for me
3989876 i had started having some pain in my hips for a few months but im kind of a self confident person and thought i could diagnose myself
3989877 i would ice my joints and take anti inflammatories and just push through
3989878 my doctor said i needed to stop running and quit doing impact sports and i handled it real well
3989879 i went home and told my husband my life was over my husband is a funny guy too he suggested my life wasnt over i was just going to have to join the real world and get myself a job
3989880 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor for that matter in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same way in any country
3989881 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
3989882 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home

3989888 a few weeks ago in training camp ben came up to me and said get ready to set that world record in prelims
3989889 the more we talked about it the more we thought we had a chance of doing that that would be the second best thing we could do
3989890 it was really great to see them thats the first serious time ive had with them in a long time
3989891 i could live the life and how many get to do that
3989892 i had a great year training traveled the world a bit and was lucky enough to make it here im going back to cal in august i really liked school and im ready to put swimming on a back burner for a little while
3989893 my family has been very supportive but i think theyd say no if i didnt go back to school the college degree is my long term insurance i could go skiing one day and break my shoulder
3989894 swimming in this day and age can take you only so far
3989895 ngobrol ngobrol kayak gini ini yg bikin aku ngerasa nyaman seru dan nyambung soalnya
3989896 mbak astrid tau gak dari pagi aku ngrasa nggak nyaman banget nih secara underwear yg aku pakai ini udah melar nyelip terus jadinya
3989897 we are begging that president suleiman comes back from damascus with toufiq with him because hes an innocent man and his family is suffering
3989898 hes spent nearly a quarter century in prison and thats enough for any crime
3989899 we really want a positive relationship with syria and this is best achieved through the establishment of diplomatic relations the proper demarcation of our shared border and the resolution of all pressing issues including the question of lebanese persons still detained in syria
3989900 we are not saying all 17 000 are in syria but we know that there are a few hundred from the testimonies of family members and witnesses
3989901 i say to the families of those missing and those detained that he who has been patient for 30 years can wait a bit longer
3989902 beer is proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy
3989903 will the west help us or are we on our own
3989904 une photographie cest un fragment de temps qui ne reviendra pas
3989905 basically i got a lot of stuff on my album thats not that simple its just basically a way to calm things down
3989906 weve been playing some good one day cricket we were number one in the world earlier this year and were a proud nation
3989907 for us to come over here and win a test series and a one day series in england would be a big achievement and were all really keen to do that
3989908 ive tried to keep myself fit during my time off and played a couple of games for durham and then after that club cricket but adapting to international cricket again is going to be my big challenge irrespective of the conditions
3989909 getting used to the intensity that international players play at again is going to be my biggest step
3989910 he mendis is a bit different and the batsmen need some time to settle in we have to be positive but ultimately it comes down to how we play him in the middle
3989911 its tough to say anything right now but we know what he have to do we know our abilities and are quite confident
3989912 after a long time we have two match winning spinners we now have more attacking options
3989913 murali has now got the support he needs and there is also support for vaas its quite a relief for a captain to have such an option in mendis for us it is always a team game
3989914 we are not complacent because we know the one dayers are a very different game we are confident with the way we are playing and have to make sure we execute our plans as we did in the tests
3989915 it is always difficult to replace him tendulkar as he contributes not only with his batting and bowling but also comes out with brilliant suggestions
3989916 too weak to scratch himself hes turned it round and hes rocketing around now hes ready you can tell when hes ready through his body language hes taking the piss out of me all the time so he must be going well
3989917 preparation has been perfect all the coaches have been fantastic
3989918 en algunos casos las indagaciones se basan s lo en un testimonio
3989919 ms p e teacher is as aggressive as a damselfish
3989920 according to the investigation the van was at fault and violated traffic rules
3989921 the olympics isnt any ordinary competition theres definitely more pressure
3989922 i didnt play to my full potential but it was good training for me psychologically
3989923 when i was behind 1 0 and even when i was trailing in the second game to be able to come back from that psychologically that was good for me i think itll be helpful for the upcoming games
3989924 fantasy football is such an enormous revenue generator the numbers are staggering and thats reflected on our site
3989925 considering the sheer number of armchair analysts and kitchen quarterbacks voicing their opinions and a lot of these people are really funny very entertaining it made sense to put them all in one place and have it coincide with the upcoming season
3989926 something like this is a really interactive program and to do this kind of program requires a fairly complex cooperative effort on the side of the sponsor and our side so we cant just roll them out
3989927 it has huge potential for other sponsors who want to work with us on these things it can be scaled really well
3989928 provides a new way for us to engage our core customer base and challenge them to become part of our online community
3989929 we firmly believe that the network model is not the right model agencies are looking for
3989930 may signify to advertisers that centro is a place to aggregate more of their budgets
3989931 we pick up new advertisers in the transition although there is a significant overlap of industries between the two
3989932 we have the ability to take those clients and overlay them across our ad management platform
3989933 its a new generation and now its time to step aside
3989934 i think he has been a tremendous sportsman and i respect him very much
3989935 i know michael does too everyone loved watching him race
3989936 its been a very long time my fourth olympics my fourth 100 freestyle final but ive swum my last race
3989937 the olympics is very special to me when i was 10 years old watching matt biondi in seoul i was inspired and wanted to take part in the olympics
3989938 it is bitterly disappointing for luke and we wish him all the best for a speedy recovery but both brett sheehan and sam cordingley have been putting up their hand and are itching for the opportunity to play in the nine jersey
3989939 back in the early days i always had a little smoke and fire not only for misdirection but to emphasize that something magic had just happened
3989940 but as the magic and magician mature you see that you dont need the bigger props
3989941 the area between my butt cheeks is filled with liquid

3989948 today i woke up feeling energetic to my utter amazement i had the house cleaned up children fed and dressed and even exercised with 10 minutes of fun dancing to music in the living room and all on time
3989949 frederic i just want to say thank you for not only letting me participate in the 21 day challenge but also for being such an inspiration you are lighting that fire under me that i needed you were sent my way when i needed you thanks again
3989950 whats interesting is that with other goal setting programs i have participated in they said to never say everyday because you would set yourself up for failure they said to plan on 5 or 6 days a week so if we miss one day of doing what we planned in our challenge do we consider that a failure just wondering so far i have met all my daily goals and this is a great push to help me to improve my health
3989951 until one is committed there is hesitancy the chance to draw back always ineffectiveness the moment one definitely commits oneself then providence moves too all sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred
3989952 you couldnt find the time to do your three habits
3989953 were sputtering offensively and with johns struggles we arent getting production there bochy said of bowker who was hitting
3989954 we need some more offense and thats why theyre here
3989955 it might have been for him but thats the art of our business hes struggling and you cant deny a kid ishikawa with a combined 24 home runs and 94 rbis
3989956 we dont want to overexpose anybody here especially a guy who hardly
3989957 they gave me a chance to come up and help the team and i felt i did that for awhile bowker said
3989958 those first couple weeks i was just in a hot zone
3989959 but i was getting myself out swinging at pitches i shouldnt be ill get out of it i know i will
3989960 what was going on there i cant even describe it i dont even know what i was doing
3989961 there were a few nibbles on him before the july 31 non waiver deadline interest in infielder rich aurilia remains nonexistent sabean said
3989962 the move is more a function of getting rohlinger up here knowing that next year were going to need somebody at that position with a bigger bat sabean said
3989963 the kind of language he uses and the kind of behavior he exhibits in the public domain toward women objectifies them and
3989964 christ matthews helped to destroy delicate hillary clintons fragile shot at the presidency
3989965 hillary clinton bugs a lot of guys i mean really bugs people
