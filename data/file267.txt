2670000 life isnt about simply stating the problem and hearing arguments from both sides
2670001 its not always black and white we listen challenge traditional thinking and empower listeners by giving concrete options for change
2670002 interpersonal edge breakthrough tools for talking to anyone anywhere about anything
2670003 want some mom whose son may have recently died to see the commander in chief playing golf
2670004 ask the headhunter reinventing the interview to win the job
2670005 have it all one bank one rate one statement and access to 50 million in fdic insurance for your cds
2670006 were not really seeing customers concerned about flagstar bank but they are concerned about other relationships
2670007 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2670008 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2670009 here in a sporting context and theyve confirmed their participation very much in the light of respect friendship athlete to athlete we have no reason to have any concerns on that
2670010 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2670011 we are trying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing
2670012 i see all the nations get together i am very upset about it i wish everybody would be at peace especially during the olympics
2670013 im finding this extreme sense of urgency to cut to the core to get to the truth
2670014 it strikes me that theres a real lack of protest songwriters out there
2670015 not to sound too harsh but with this record im not concerned who im going to lose or pick up
2670016 because everything felt more urgent the environment a war based on deception i had to take a leap of faith that a lot of people are feeling the way im feeling
2670017 i had been squaring it up pretty well all day so i wasnt really nervous
2670018 i saw that so many people were dying i just and you know this is this is crazy this isn t want i was supposed to be for
2670019 oh great chance for promotion and i can offer you a signing bonus etc etc oh i don t know much about the nbc tech trade but as an infantryman you ll blah blah blah
2670020 i thought you were the boss you always refer to yourself as the boss
2670021 ah i see when there are problems to be solved you are not the boss
2670022 things that were not in the interest of the company
2670023 its not so much that i have lost my place more that the position i play has been lost
2670024 previously it had been two banks of four and wayne rooney off a striker obviously the striker could be anyone but that position needs to score goals
2670025 now however you want to describe it its been more of a 4 5 1 sometimes even with steve gerrard just pushing forward to support the front man
2670026 as it stands there seems to be only one space when there used to be two basically wayne has taken that space in the games i have been available for
2670027 me and wayne were a partnership up front now its steve who is pushing on so really it depends on the formation if i have a chance of playing or not
2670028 the formation may change and if wayne is not available for the czech friendly i am ready i have never lost my belief
2670029 i would dearly love to beat that record its an unbelievable milestone so is going past 100 caps but a few people have done that
2670030 what would i rather have well there would be only person with the record wouldnt there so its probably more of a record to have
2670031 it would be fantastic to achieve but obviously the only chance ive got of getting it is if i play
2670032 for the sake of the environment it is critical to look at future steel vehicle as all vehicles from a life cycle assessment lca perspective
2670033 based on the recent lca study and model developed at the university of california santa barbara implementation of more efficient powertrain systems elevates the importance of the emissions from material production placing greater emphasis on selecting a low greenhouse gas intensive material such as steel
2670034 compared to other materials used to reduce vehicle weight these advanced high strength steels produce five to 15 times less ghg emissions during the material manufacturing phase which greatly reduces a vehicles life cycle carbon footprint
2670035 were not just looking at the vehicle design and its impact on ghg at the tailpipe
2670036 were concerned with the whole life cycle of the vehicle from the emissions produced and energy used to create raw materials all the way to the impact of recycling if the whole life cycle is not taken into account there is the distinct possibility of having a net increase in ghg if the wrong material choice is made this isnt just speculation weve got very clear models that demonstrate this
2670037 today is eight eight eight so lets go for dinner
2670038 my accident is well recorded i had 23 operations i am five inches shorter than i used to be and i was in hospital for six months it was just awful but it wasnt the reason for my divorce
2670039 my marriage ended because john mccain didnt want to be 40 he wanted to be 25 you know that happens it just does
2670040 while they will face several challenges but they will overcome these
2670041 no one thinks its odd that arguably the nfls no 1 tv draw will spend his final year or two in new york
2670042 israel will not be the first nation to introduce nuclear weapons to the middle east
2670043 it has always been our intention to develop a nuclear potential we now have that potential
2670044 we do have the capacity to produce nuclear weapons and if the arabs are willing to introduce nuclear weapons into the middle east then israel should not be too late in having nuclear weapons too
2670045 built a nuclear option not in order to have a hiroshima but an oslo
2670046 the more active you are the better the insulin works but if you have an active lifestyle you need to test more frequently
2670047 you become astute how your body reacts to various situations
2670048 insulin counteracts carbs so youve got to keep track of your carb ratio and it can shift depending on time of day if im sick or stressed i can tell if im frustrated about work or something my sugar goes way higher
2670049 id pass out and slam my head into the ground and split my head open and patch myself up because i didnt want to go to the hospital
2670050 youre a 13 year old kid trying to fit in and you have to take shots and blood tests
2670051 youre different and if you get too much blood sugar you get dizzy sweaty confused and scared its tough on a kid but they can be active i was
2670052 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2670053 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2670054 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2670055 and the funny thing was i didnt even want to finish that i thought im going to overload on sugar it was too much i guess my taste buds have heightened
2670056 menopause set in and i went to the doctor and said hey im putting on weight what can i do
2670057 he said nothing youll have to live with this i thought theres got to be something i cut out butter and mayonnaise thinking thats where my fat was coming from that didnt work i really needed something else
2670058 what a portion size is to me that was the big thing if its bigger than the palm of my hand its not going in my body itll be two meals instead of one i do that all the time when i eat out
2670059 usually i have friends willing to split a meal with me my friends always say they get the better half of the deal i always want the smaller portion
2670060 im more satisfied with less and not miserable anymore i always tell people my favorite thing to order in a restaurant is a fork because then i can eat off my friends plates
2670061 i thought i was getting enough but i wasnt even close i exercise almost daily now yoga once a week a home gym walking at the sunrise mall
2670062 i put in a home gym because i absolutely hated the health club because i didnt want people looking at what i used to call my fat jiggles walking at the mall is good because no dogs chase you its an enclosed area air conditioned and costs you nothing a good pair of tennis shoes and youre off
2670063 at weight watchers ive started a maintenance circle for people whove already reached their goals its important to hear from people who have done it long term
2670064 my husband jerry he lost 40 pounds sort of on the sidelines because i wasnt going to cook two meals and i will have a bowl of strawberries in the evening so good a big treat
2670065 french fries used to love them now i taste grease when i eat french fries i dont want them now whereas before i called them salt licks because id take the fries and dip them into salt that craving is gone
2670066 a good pair of tennis shoes is all you need and youre off
2670067 its one of the most i dont want to say primitive but basic forms of training
2670068 you dont need a lot to get a good workout at home a simple tool like that you can do so many things with
2670069 you can do a ton of different stuff with one
2670070 i cant think of a workout where i dont use one
2670071 it helps the core which is kind of necessary for everyday life
2670072 i think its great for people who arent as motivated to go to the gym and work out you can get a great workout at home
2670073 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2670074 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2670075 most of what i know about writing ive learned through running every day these are practical physical lessons how much can i push myself how much rest is appropriate and how much is too much how far can i take something and still make it decent and consistent
2670076 i know that if i hadnt become a long distance runner when i became a novelist my work would have been vastly different
2670077 if pain werent involved who would ever go to the trouble of taking part in sports like the triathlon or the marathon which demand such an investment in time and energy
2670078 its precisely because of the pain precisely because we want to overcome that pain that we can get the feeling through this process of really being alive awakening to an awareness of the fluidity within action itself
2670079 we start you off right away with jumps forward backward fall in and then finally dive
2670080 weve had people start competing after just six or seven lessons we get all ages i had a middle aged woman just the other day start diving she said she hadnt done it since 1983 but wanted to start again
2670081 some people stand close and play defensive then there are people like me who hop around jump and slam
2670082 even if youve only played in your backyard well get you in a group to match your skill level it takes time to get proficient
2670083 at the higher levels youll see forehand topspins coming at you at 90 miles per hour
2670084 most kids start on whatever single speed bike theyve got in the garage if you get into it then you can shop for your first bmx dedicated bike
2670085 the course theyre using in beijing is radically more hard than what youre going to find at roseville or rio linda
2670086 theyre much tamer tracks dont let the scariness of the olympics keep you from giving bmx a shot
2670087 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2670088 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2670089 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2670132 even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall in the way of running mates senator obama should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket
2670133 first there was his call for americans to check their tires which is common sense advice but hardly has the makings of a national energy strategy if we cant drill our way out of the problem it seems even more unlikely that we can inflate our way out of it

2670183 but there have been times when ive run into a market quickly to grab a few things and didnt keep the receipts
2670184 with fewer new condos being built there will be a drought at some point
2670185 the biggest selection is now and in the next six months to a year once those units are sold the builders will wait until the economy gets better to build again
2670186 the big guys like horton centex and lennar closed the doors to new projects by early 2007 and most got out alive

2670189 if you go to north hollywood there were 20 condominium projects for sale last year and most sold if they didnt the developer sold some units and held the rest for rentals
2670190 we went to 15 to 20 open houses looking at places and used it as a way to choose our realtor
2670191 in general i think there are some good deals out there now but there are still some that are overpriced
2670192 even though the market has dropped off dramatically there are sales taking place in high end pockets
2670193 were almost 40 pre sold in the project before its finished
2670194 the bigger problem for us is getting qualified buyers to requalify under current lending requirements
2670195 no new project has started in our county in the last two years
2670196 weve seen 12 builders and developers in san diego county consolidate with their orange county or riverside county operations or close their offices
2670197 we had projects in the pipeline for irvine palm desert pasadena and anaheim and are continuing forward with them but have shifted them to rental instead of being for sale properties

2670204 theyre actually the first ones that evolved and they are able to tolerate the warmer waters that we have in southern california
2670205 this is really significant because of climate change the fish up north cannot tolerate the warm waters so as northern streams become warmer we may hold the key to having steelhead trout

2670227 the more mitt romney speaks the less believable he becomes mitt romney has spent a year trying to convince granite staters that he is trustworthy it looks like they arent buying it and for good reason
2670228 we talk about our ability to see through the baloney if a candidate is a phony we assure ourselves and the rest of the world well know it mitt romney is such a candidate
2670229 mitt romneys in good company the concord monitor attacked ronald reagan george bush in 1980
2670230 regardless of your choice for president who do you think has been best at saying what they believe rather than saying what they think the voters want to hear rudy giuliani mike huckabee john mccain mitt romney or fred thompson
2670231 indicted for dealings involving figures with ties to the mafia
2670232 romney got tough on drugs like meth he never pardoned a single criminal and mike huckabee he granted 1 033 pardons and commutations including 12 convicted murderers huckabee granted more clemencies than the previous three governors combined even reduced penalties for manufacturing methamphetamine on crime the difference is judgment
2670233 john mccain an honorable man but is he the right republican for the future mccain opposes repeal of the death tax and voted against the bush tax cuts twice mccain pushed to let every illegal immigrant stay here permanently even voted to allow illegals to collect social security and mitt romney mitt romney cut taxes and spending as governor he opposes amnesty for illegals mitt romney john mccain there is a difference
2670234 in just one week iowa voters will kick off the 2008 presidential caucuses and primaries and in just one week ill be on my way to the republican presidential nomination and to the white house thanks to your support p s its a long road and we have asked a lot i assure you that it will all be worth it when victory is clear

2670240 toda la sociedad andaluza y espa ola que lo recuerde
2670241 mitt romney is now running the most negative campaign of any presidential candidate in either party
2670242 huckabee defends record on crime romney thompson attack him over meth law pardons commutations
2670243 romney attacks on immigration ads criticize huckabee as favoring benefits for illegal immigrants
2670244 romney fires off first attack ad targeting fellow republican presidential hopeful huckabee
2670245 and he is very orthodox on gays guns and god but he knows theres more than just these issues
2670246 playground diplomacy which has shocked many in the republican community these are hard lines considering mitt romney as governor of massachusetts was much more like bill clinton then mike huckabee ever was
2670247 politics is tough but when john mccain compared me to bill clinton and said i was untrustworthy thats over the line
2670248 all these leaders that most of the national media dont recognize theyre all coming to huckabee
2670249 youve got the home school network youve got the right to life network youve got networks of megachurches
2670250 the huckabee campaign apparently understands something about the evangelical community that people outside dont that its highly decentralized
2670251 and if they hear something good about a candidate from someone they trust through a religious network theyre a part of it can be quite effective
2670252 i got into a little trouble this past week because i actually had the audacity to say merry christmas
2670253 im not here to make a political statement or deliver a political message
2670254 i dont think americans want a political race about whos the best christian and therefore whos going to make the best president
2670255 a lot of people who might not be household names to the general public but are important constituencies on the religious right
2670256 pyramid mentality somebody here shares 10 references with somebody here who then shares 10 references
2670257 there are many channels of communication within the evangelical community

2670268 its one of the hardest races and id like to try other events
2670269 the event starts to hurt halfway through it so for him to do what he does after that last turn and go that fast its pretty much inhuman
2670270 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2670271 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2670272 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2670273 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2670274 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2670275 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future

2670281 national wealth and power to further enrich itself and its cronies while the marginalized regions of the country suffer from terrible poverty
2670282 it does have the potential to be the breadbasket of africa
2670283 this is shocking because i thought the government had done a lot to ensure safety
2670284 i think this might hurt chinas image in the world but i dont think itll disturb the olympics per se
2670285 you do the best you can and its not always pretty
2670286 here you have a bunch of people dead and several diminished and youre charged with solving the crime you try not to step on peoples toes but sometimes it happens
2670287 people who would kill their sisters or daughters for bringing shame on the family would do anything to avoid being labeled a debtor
2670288 why do we do this by what justification and is this ok

2670290 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2670291 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2670292 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2670293 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2670294 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2670295 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2670296 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2670297 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2670345 clearly from the investor standpoint alaska has become a less attractive place to invest exploration and production dollars
2670346 it was a bad idea in the 1980s and it is an even worse idea today

2670447 heres a twist take your choppy qt movie and export it to a wmv youll need flip4mac the resulting wmv on my system plays fine in both the windows media players and quicktime but in qtime pro take the same wmv file and re export it as a quicktime file and its back to its choppy self again so it seems that the problem with quicktime is reading quicktime files windows wmv files play fine of course that doesnt help those if us who depend on qtime to make a living my daw is not going to read a wmv file it wants to see a qt file and so do i darn it caveat may or may not apply for those without sound i have not had that problem but would be interested to hear from folks who do and if exporting to a wmv works to fix what as well apple really needs to make this a high priority fix
2670448 the common denominator of 99 of such problems and most of us have encountered some is the plain fact that no one not even apple can beta test all conceivable permutations of system and software installations that we might have and i doubt whether even two are identical
2670449 i couldnt agree more i have a close friend who writes the system decimal updates at apple and it is very complex work difficult to test every configuration
2670450 you cannot install quicktime on this volume a newer version of this software is already installed

2670511 theyre actually the first ones that evolved and they are able to tolerate the warmer waters that we have in southern california
2670512 this is really significant because of climate change the fish up north cannot tolerate the warm waters so as northern streams become warmer we may hold the key to having steelhead trout

2670522 but he was pretty relentless on the court hed go after every ball play every possession he was a kid that when you saw him play you couldnt wait to go see him again because he had just an infectious demeanor

2670538 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices

2670556 when we first looked into finding a web hosting service provider we were completely stumped the sheer number of web hosting service providers and available plans made it hard even for us to make a decision about which one to choose this site was made with the intent of making the whole process a lot easier for you than it was for us
2670557 part of what makes our sites so successful is the fact that we arent afraid to tell people who dont have a clue what theyre really getting out of the service
2670558 no this provider doesnt have a money back guarantee but they will refund any time for unused months of service details like that
2670559 we want people who visit the site to have an enlightening experience whether they know something about web hosting or not

2670601 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2670602 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2670603 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2670604 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2670605 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2670606 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2670607 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2670608 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2670611 this seems a good time to acknowledge a little history about one of the countys oldest arts organizations the slo art center the story is one of impressive achievement considering that for close to its first 30 years it operated with all volunteers chief among these was arne nybak
2670612 arne an accomplished painter accepted the job of curator when the art association built the building at broad and monterey streets for 30 years he coordinated the calendar for the nine major shows a year in the gray wing selected artists designed the installations and was a mentor to many who served on the board of directors or in other capacities as docents and volunteers
2670613 arne was never paid a dime his contributions of leadership financial support and skill proved to be a lifeblood for the art center many many others joined forces in the dedicated effort to make the art center a thriving organization the grassroots foundation upon which it stands speaks triumphantly to the power of community
2670614 i actually start with no concept as much as i can
2670615 we were going to take the art world by storm
2670616 i had no idea that this was going to go on for 17 16 years now
2670617 if fuel prices stay the way they are right now or even go up a little higher as they say they may in a couple more years i dont know what were going to do
2670618 we just stay in one spot longer and travel a heck of a lot less
2670619 after 9 11 the rv industry went through the roof

2670623 we stopped at costco before we left and loaded up all these bins with cold drinks and sandwich meat and stuff like that

2670625 and if its more than its worth you just dont go
2670626 were fortunate enough to live in such a nice place where we can drive on a tank of fuel and be in pretty incredible places
2670627 what weve seen in the past five years is a whole new phase of the internet one of the most important principle of this is participation everyone can easily set up blogs upload videos and create music and podcasts for the first time we are not just consumers but are enabled to become creators so we have this doubling of media space leading to a world of infinte content of infinite entertainment
2670628 to me web 2 0 is not a technology revolution its rather users accepting the idea of collaborating
2670629 in my talk i point to threadless com and our own make magazine as examples of two very old school businesses selling t shirts and a print magazine that act as and succeed as web 2 0 companies how they put their users front and center
2670630 marketing 2 0 is not about understanding or even mastering this blog flickr del icio us or youtube phenomena its rather to take action upon consumers and customers driving our initiatives and to me its above all for us to establish and maintain a transparent and empathic dialog with them
2670631 the proposal of polish prime minister donald tusk to hold a meeting of the european council at the level of heads of government has been accepted we dont know the date yet

2670634 full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
2670635 we did not accept military intervention by milosevics serbia in other former yugoslav states on the grounds of protecting serbian passport holders and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe
2670636 the eu and nato must take the initiative and stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy in the east of europe the russian federation has overstepped a red line
2670637 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2670638 we are a european democracy a small european democracy right now being butchered by this russian government

2670642 i had applied for a job at a supermarket and was scheduled for an interview when i saw an ad for a larvae sighter
2670643 when people see me hanging around their back yards they do want to know what im doing
2670644 they suddenly become fascinated with mosquito control and some even go into the woods to watch me work
2670645 i search for jobs on the internet and there are plenty to choose from
2670646 when i was younger i used to go into the woods all the time

2670651 he president saakashvili is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2670652 i dont think he can count on the us cavalry riding in
2670653 you dont bring in to nato a country that has this sort of trouble
2670654 it might be a signal to the russians saying that the 2014 sochi olympics will not go the way russia wants if there is no progress on the settlement
2670655 to re establish the authority of russian controlled negotiating and peacekeeping formats to capture georgian controlled villages in south ossetia and to dissuade nato from approving a membership action plan for georgia
2670656 the russians want a more direct confrontation with the west and i hope the bush administration has the wisdom not to give them that satisfaction
2670657 a full fledged adjustment phase has begun for the euro
2670658 whoop it up for the ragged trousers put the lazy greasy fizzle who cant pay his debts on the altar and bow down and worship him what we need is not the respect of our fellow men but the chance to get something for nothing

2670661 no doubt about it 2006 was the worst year for republicans since watergate

2670663 they see light at the end of the tunnel after eight years of bush
2670664 two years ago for various reasons there certainly was almost a national stampede to vote against gop candidates of any office
2670665 today people are much more looking at individual races and candidates
2670666 this wont be a referendum on party or incumbent its going to be candidate driven
2670667 if you run the right candidates and adhere to the principles of low taxes and fiscal responsibility the voters will stay with you
2670668 thats why what happens here is a microcosm for what happens nationally
2670669 how can that be how can a corporation own the copyright to code that is open source
2670670 i hereby assign copyright in this code to the project to be licensed under the same terms as the rest of the code
2670671 getting them back was like making a big deal without losing anybody
2670672 in the past id have said a lot of guys would be gone but with them signing hanley to a long term deal it shows theyre willing to make an effort but i dont know who else theyd do that with nothing is for certain nobody knows who if anybody will be gone
2670673 right now weve put ourselves in a position to win the division and we cant worry about anything else
2670674 im just doing my job why are you trying to give me more money
2670675 its getting a little tougher to go places thats a good thing a lot of things are changing more media more pub on tv its something that comes with the territory
2670676 believe me man if you were around here the two previous years theres a lot of hope for everybody
2670677 thats why most of us if were in this business long enough make bad decisions were all competitive the juices get flowing and you think boy if i added that one big name out there that would really put us over the hump
2670678 most of the time just because of the nature of the business that big trade or the big piece you went out and acquired doesnt get you where you wanted to go
2670679 its kind of unrealistic for a small market team to even think about the shotgun approach even if we wanted to
2670680 but i think we all agreed we werent trying to create an environment where we all of a sudden had that go for it mentality and we were going to try to win it all one year and then maybe spend the next three or four years digging out of last place
2670681 is imperative but its difficult at the same time as long as everyone is on the same page you can be patient
2670682 fans have to understand that everyone has to understand that but if youre patient and you have good acquisitions things can start working out these young players start developing and it can be something good for many years
2670683 ive been on a bunch of teams but this is special here its really beyond anything id consider a normal baseball atmosphere we blend together so well you dont understand how powerful that is
2670684 it lends itself to anything it lends itself for beautiful stories for cinderella stories stories of triumph stories of victory over adversity in baseball anything is possible
2670685 i was a rookie that year i didnt really know what was going on
2670686 when i look at 95 we did some stuff offensively
2670687 if we had this pitching staff on that team we would have run away with it and won the division by 15 or 20 games
2670688 he just took out nine years of frustration on the best team in baseball
2670689 thats like asking if on halloween theyre going to have trick or treating
2670690 it would be pointless to sit here and be mad over things i cant control
2670691 thats when you know youre screwed as a baseball player
2670692 im going to go home tonight and make some decisions because ive told my wife dont ask me anything
2670693 a couple things i read there really didnt make any sense
2670694 im gonna talk to him and a couple other guys
2670695 and hes used the phrase the starting pitchers like we as the starting pitchers were focused but some other people arent or something thats ridiculous
2670696 it didnt look good he carried us the last month and a half its a big hole to fill but were capable of filling it im just now starting to suck it up
2670697 i thought we really hit it off in expirat vineri noapte
2670698 i was trying to get in and he wouldnt let me in and he said whats your name
2670699 a cool machine designed to help just plug me in and do the rounds
2670700 its inhuman its in your lungs its in your legs its in your abs everything is just on fire
2670701 im just happy to get the first one under my belt
2670702 i started to get chills on my body and knew i was starting to get excited
2670703 you not only do your best time and break his old world record and you are still looking at his feet
2670704 ninety nine percent of the world they just see him go but they will never know how incredibly hard and ridiculous that is
2670705 i think its the most painful race youre just totally spent you start to feel the pain halfway through its inhuman its in your lungs its in your legs its in your abs everything is just on fire
2670706 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got like these cold chills
2670707 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2670708 its probably going to be the most watched game in the history of the world
2670709 its going to send a lot of chills through my body just to be there and be part of it
2670710 the ioc executive board upon receiving the recommendations from the disciplinary commission has declared her thanou ineligible under rule 23 21
2670711 indeed the executive board went further and unanimously voted under rule 45 to bar her to send a firm signal that she has brought the olympics into disrepute
2670712 there were a whole string of events in this sorry tale
2670713 these resulted in a scandalous saga that overshadowed the athens games
2670714 it was a very serious prejudice against the olympic movement
2670715 i think jon fitch is a future ufc welterweight champion and my money is on him this weekend no one is unbeatable in mma matt hughes seemed unbeatable a few years ago but it didnt stay that way i think fitch has a great chance to pull off the upset on saturday but even if he loses i think hell get the belt within the next year or so hes very very good
2670716 plus dala lama que le dala lama lui m me
2670717 there is a different competition level on the field its much higher than in the dominican plus a lot of these kids are going away from home for the first time
2670718 the pressure on some of these kids from back home is tremendous
2670719 a lot of these kids are the only providers for their families for the majority of the cases they represent their families only hope when you have that pressure already it can eat you up
2670720 i tell them to learn as much as they can when they are not on the baseball field to enhance their cultural experience
2670721 i think if they are comfortable in their surroundings they will play better on the field i want them to know there is life outside casper ghosts second baseman angelys nina 19 heads back to his host familys home after riding his bike to the bank to cash his paycheck hyoung chang the denver post baseball i dont want them sulking and thinking that a 0 for 4 night with three punchouts is the end of the world
2670722 its kind of neat to see all the guys whove come through here
2670723 he traveled a lot and it was comforting to know that other people were taking care of him its important to have a place to call home
2670724 when everth left he cried and hugged me and told me he loved our family
2670725 so i guess we really did help him out he still calls me
2670726 his english is much improved and hes more outgoing hes been my biggest project and its so gratifying to see him taking off in some ways he reminds me of ubaldo
2670727 i was like wow there are a lot of blond people a lot of blond girls
2670728 and everybody was white and everything was about rodeos and cows and horses it was so different
2670729 when i was growing up i wanted to go to america and play baseball
2670730 i was so excited to be there i hardly ever missed home i always thought something good was going to happen here
2670731 i told strength coach brad andress in spring training that i would get 70
2670732 there are not a lot of players out there like me i will be honest with you
2670733 i would like to stay here with this group of guys
2670734 no one can understand what its like to run that much
2670735 its a lot of wear and tear on the body
2670736 we thought we had a good team in spring training but we knew we had a lot to prove
2670737 when i traded karstens and jose tabata for nady and damaso marte i had buyers remorse
2670738 thats how i knew it was a good deal for both teams
2670739 hes about as steady as they come when he wants to play and clearly he wants to play right now
2670740 i hate it thats a 4 50 era i dont want that guy on my team

2670752 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2670753 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2670754 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2670755 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2670756 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2670757 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2670758 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2670759 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised

2670761 we applied for funding but were not awarded funds in the first round
2670762 the parks and recreation authority had a second round of funding and we were fortunate enough to get funding
2670763 martha wolfe town clerk then contacted the two families who owned the property at guilford and perry road to see how they felt about selling the land they were ok with us buying the property
2670764 this will be a very passive park we want to keep as many trees as possible but we will have to take out some vegetation
2670765 we also envision some really colorful landscaping but there will be opportunities for the community to give their input before we get to that part
2670766 and an increase of 157 in controlled substance you could actually say that was the whole increase basically thats what fueled it
2670767 there was more aggressive investigation and arrests we probably did more drug sweeps with the dogs than weve done in the past and frankly its available everywhere
2670768 one of the things i hear from the kids is its just so easy to get their hands on marijuana i even had one kid tell me its harder to buy cigarettes than it is to buy marijuana cigarettes youve got to have id
2670769 you have to understand working in a school is like a mini city
2670770 the school resource officer will take care of anything that happens in the day to day business of their city
2670771 the high schools got what 2 400 students and theres another 1 100 in the middle school next door
2670772 im not sure of the population of biscoe or seagrove but thats probably about the same size these schools are their own little community for nine hours a day
2670773 youre not going to see any bullying shoving matches simple assaults burglaries things like that
2670774 this is a very specific report and its just for very specific offenses
2670775 thats not to say they didnt have any incidents they just didnt have any that matched the descriptions of these 17 incidents that go to the state
2670776 greensboro grew and now we will have to spend time knitting things together again
2670777 we want to be more than the people who park in front of their houses on sunday
2670778 we hope to get volunteers from the neighborhood to help with that too
2670779 we invite anyone from the surrounding area to bring their lawn chair relax a little enjoy music and have fun
2670780 well that doesnt happen you can see which one of them has really done their homework
2670781 the va is overtaxed sometimes and often veterans feel theyre not getting needed services
2670782 sometimes vets have been rejected or are in an appeal stage so theyll come to me with that and ill find out their status in the va system
2670783 if it comes back not favorably for the vet i go through the appeal with them and if that doesnt work i go through congressional channels
2670784 for some veterans getting through the bureaucracy is like punching blind on a keyboard
2670785 steven knows which keys to punch he runs with it and gets things done
2670786 he stays on top of changes and he gets answers one way or another
2670787 you have to remember that when many were discharged after serving in world war ii there was a shortage of metal so medals were a lower priority
2670788 i told him this country cant pay you enough for your service
2670789 these world war ii vets are such a national treasure
2670790 if a husband died from complications from a service related disability the widow is due a widows pension
2670791 also if a vet or surviving spouse makes below a certain income level the va has a mean standard of living for them
2670792 the n c general assembly authorized helping veterans from these wars who joined the service before graduating from high school finally get their diplomas
2670793 i had one 83 year old who cried when i presented his because he had always felt like a second class citizen because he had not graduated
2670794 sometimes my wife says my work with the vets is like a full time job
2670795 ill do it until my wife says enough i get burned out or i die
2670796 i spent 36 years and five months in the u s army god my country and the army have been good to me and this is my way of paying them back
2670797 chicagos greenway system has been layered for 40 to 50 years and has been integrated into how people live
2670798 a survey says the current greenways arent being used because theyre not convenient to where people live and want to go
2670799 its a good system but its been developed as part of the parks system and not the transportation system
2670800 and be linear to downtown in a meaningful way i think more people will use it and in a way other than for just health and fitness
2670801 if shoppers went out while the item was tax free and on a good sale maybe they bought another notebook or something for their childs class or another pair of jeans with the savings
2670802 four dollars a gallon gas gets over that very quickly
2670803 energy cost is the first thing that people mention to me every day we need to become the state that says alternative energy sources are important to us we need to be helping people with manufacturing solar panels and windmill parts creating those jobs in north carolina once we do that those jobs arent going to be outsourced
2670804 were not sure how long it would take on some of the development there
2670805 i think weve got to do it all we need that comprehensive policy
2670806 the price mechanism of the free market is an amazing thing
2670807 without deliberate attention by anyone it devotes the most attention and resources to the most efficient source of energy possible
2670808 the less the government is involved the more efficient the market would be
2670809 neither is talking a lot about the role of nuclear power in the role of energy production
2670810 both candidates reflect their national parties in terms of their plans
2670811 kay hagan is a hypocrite of the highest order for attacking senator dole for being too close to oil interests when she herself is an oil baroness and is profiting from the very product she is condemning
2670812 it is no wonder that hagan has no energy plan she is profiting from the status quo
2670813 i had the opportunity to take classes with world class scholars in college but didnt take the initiative to meet them personally
2670814 i later wished that i had pushed myself a little harder to go up to them after class or see them in their offices
2670815 and i found professors who were willing to take a personal interest in me and help me grow in my own learning
2670816 one of our classic texts teaches the bashful student does not learn whether bashful or um just unmotivated thats a good lesson
2670817 when i began college 60 miles away from my small farming community in indiana it was like i had been dropped off on another planet
2670818 as i often tell my students i not only lived through the 60s i can remember them since i didnt do drugs
2670819 folks were going down in flames experimenting with mind altering substances
2670820 my quaker faith which teaches that it is of paramount importance to keep the mind clear as god communicates directly to each person and wed darn well better be clear headed when she chooses to talk saw me through unscathed
2670821 and honestly the young people i know are much wiser than i was at that age i often feel i am learning from them
2670822 my hope is theyll trust that deep inner wisdom because that is one of the ways god speaks to us
2670823 and as always i hope my daughter will remember to call her mother
2670824 whatever you do reflects upon your family as well as you
2670825 as a result there were parties and things that i didnt get invited to but i found out that wasnt the end of the world
2670826 our personalities are more malleable during these years than they will be again many of the vices that are considered necessary for college life are easy to put on and hell to take off they become marbleized into our personality growing as we mature so they are not easy to extract
2670827 he could kick my tail running with his long legs and not even breathe hard
2670828 he would talk about theology or women or both while i wheezed trying to keep up
2670829 im the furthest thing from a prude there is a great goodness to life that god has given us that is meant to be enjoyed including alcohol and sex
2670830 however many destructive habits like abusing alcohol dipping smokeless smoking cigs or weed cruising porn etc began in our college years when they were considered hip long before they started to scab over
2670831 after several months of sitting in front of a computer scanning documents i realized i was not cut out for work in the business office
2670832 not long after i accepted an opportunity to work in admissions and serve as a host for visitors and guide for prospective students this was a perfect match and i ended up loving it
2670833 i falsely believed the approval of others forged my identity
2670834 when others see our confidence they will either choose to associate with us or find another friend
2670835 experience and training prepare us for gainful employment but without passion our work is just a job
2670836 we thought it would be good to have shelters and rescue organizations come out to let people know that there are so many animals in need of homes shelters in need of donations and volunteers
2670837 we had a husky get out of the yard and when we went to get him from the guilford county animal shelter i was stunned at how many dogs they have
2670838 these dogs they cant stay there forever they need homes
2670839 about a dozen businesses are participating and we hope to have opportunities for people to adopt animals if we can get the shelters to do something like that
2670840 i love being able to walk to the grocery store
2670841 you dont have the lifestyle like this you dont have everything right here its not half as appealing
2670842 we can often sit there in the evening and watch the world go by
2670843 there are a lot of choices in the conventional suburban areas what were seeing is more choices in a more urban lifestyle
2670844 a lot of people around this age group tend to want to live in urban areas
2670845 i really didnt see anything i liked in a lot of the suburban complexes
2670846 they didnt know how to deal with something that was part residential and part commercial now its a little more common
2670847 when you see what it is that the mix of uses is complementary it becomes more acceptable
2670848 were actually a little bit behind the curve here in greensboro
2670849 with gas prices rising sprawl is becoming a real risk factor in real estate
2670850 thats kind of what southside did it proved there was a market
2670851 its just kind of a match made in heaven youre kind of killing two birds with one stone
2670852 they want to live in the building above port city java
2670853 you have to make sure you dont have partying going on upstairs or downstairs that interferes with the other
2670854 its easier to go out to the edge of town and grow horizontally rather than vertically
2670855 theres a lot to make people think about changing their travel habits
2670856 were still new to the game and the learning curve is still very steep
2670857 i think we will see more of this not less
2670858 i am responsible for 32 employees and for marketing and public relations i respond to clients needs both individuals and institutions also i still conduct hands on treatment i usually handle the most complex work
2670859 my mom used to take me to museums a lot thats where i learned to appreciate these materials she also used to draw and paint
2670860 he introduced me to a number of conservators and i was able to have internships and they provided me with guidelines
2670861 you can take two paths the first is an extended apprenticeship and the other is to apply to graduate school with the appropriate qualifications those being either a background in library science or the study of art or art history and a knowledge of basic and organic chemistry
2670862 a lot of patience projects can take from several months to several years it also takes extreme attention to detail you might be working on a map thats 50 inches by 60 inches and youre concentrating on an area thats 1 square inch
2670863 you also need good sturdy hands like a surgeons you need to know your material and understand what materials you need for your work and aging properties of the materials
2670864 you need to have good manual dexterity and you cannot be colorblind this is still very much hands on work
2670865 some projects are extremely large and highly valuable and can be complicated to treat because of the extent of the damage you never know without prior knowledge of their treatment what materials were used to glue things down with
2670866 anything a conservationist applies to an object must be reversible for future treatment
2670867 observing the beauty of an object once its been fully conserved knowing what bad condition it came in
2670868 a conservationist has an obligation to maintain the integrity of the artifact its not the conservationists goal to make it look brand new the main objective is to stabilize the object for future generations and make it aesthetically acceptable for exhibition purposes the object is a period piece and it should look like it
2670869 being in the industry like i am i had high expectations
2670870 they definitely exceeded our expectations its exactly what we were looking for and then some we would never in a million years come up with some of the ideas that nora did
2670871 it was probably a typical kitchen of a 20 something year old house
2670872 a lot of what makes a kitchen is the lighting so the electrical work is a big part of what we do
2670873 im the kind of person who enjoys taking on projects and seeing them through to completion i enjoy the details as much as the tactics involved in getting it done im not the big idea person im the one who likes to take a big idea and turns it into a tangible product and outcome i enjoy working with a team of people that is as flexible and fun as they are focused on getting the job done right
2670874 we would get knee deep mud out there its only a quarter inch deep here
2670875 it was just like a lake going through there we had to get up under there and dig that muck out we were on our knees with shovels you just do it a bucket at a time
2670876 i guess nobody had been up in the attic in many years and just didnt know what was going on
2670877 theyd been up there so long the guano was a health hazard
2670878 were here till the last trailers full and the floors are washed
2670879 we had to shore it up and take all the burn out you put a suit on and you still get covered it doesnt seem like it comes off of you for about a month it sticks to you like glue
2670880 yesterday i had a job where something was dead in the chimney a dead squirrel
2670881 you have to kind of crawl up the chimney and reach around the maggots and stuff come down
2670882 i actually found out about critter control when i was getting out of the navy
2670883 youve got more critters running around then snakes are out and about
2670884 from something real small like a bird in a dryer vent to something real large where youre netting and securing thousands of square feet of an industrial complex
2670885 dass es schwierig wenn nicht sogar unm glich ist sich im rat auf eine gemeinsame erkl rung zu einigen
2670886 bol to mlad bocian ktor mal parazity a s m by sa vo vo nej pr rode nevedel do i dlh ieho veku
2670887 i thought this is never going to get made no studio is going to back it
2670888 a native american woman whos not in buckskin shes complex she has depth and shes not standing in the background looking stoic thats what i loved about this film
2670889 the mohawk women the way they hold themselves thats so reserved thats definitely lilas main strength
2670890 i was interested to know more when i learned that they did it by driving across the ice
2670891 they needed to have enough courage to brave that one mile frozen expanse in order to make much more money
2670892 its sort of an ode to the westerns this lawless land where anything goes
2670893 sometimes the adventure in our life is the adventure of paying the rent which is not so glamorous and doesnt involve pyrotechnics to portray but is in fact as compelling an adventure of survival as any
2670894 i wrote my own play and directed it and acted in it
2670895 somebody in the audience filmed it and sent it to a casting director in l a she called the next day and asked me to submit a portfolio i was so green i didnt have a portfolio
2670896 id move back to seattle in a second if i could get the work
2670897 im writing my own stuff because theres just not quality work out there for the type of actress i am
2670898 i want roles that a native american could be that have nothing to do with the fact that im native
2670899 it happens live in front of an audience in a finite space my job is to reinvent the shrek story for the theater not to copy the film
2670900 i havent even gone back to watch the movie in the last six months
2670901 we wanted someone from the set and costumes school who could give us the whole picture tim is a very creative man who does both things brilliantly
2670902 its a big terrain he has to cover onstage and it wouldnt work if we made him super big with the actor wearing stilts
2670903 and the fur is fabric threaded with venetian blind cords to make it swing and move giving it more life
2670904 but this is not fashion its theater so its all about textures and how it moves under the lights
2670905 it was fine because i like simplicity and i come from a philosophy of creating good theater that doesnt have to cost gazillions
2670906 tim has come up with a fluency of stage language that isnt just about bringing a lot of set pieces on and off the design really morphs it moves it is really light on its feet
2670907 my main goal as a designer is always to support the story and the actors
2670908 for me the story of shrek is simple but it has a lot of meaning and a lot of heart what i do has to be part of that
2670909 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead
2670910 and ended up making six lousy movies two good movies and one great movie
2670911 bernie was an icon and one of the most successful talent managers in the business
2670912 he was a father to me and he was my mentor and my partner and the godfather of my eldest son and im going to miss him every day for the rest of my life
2670913 he worked with me every day until i left to become chairman of paramount in 2005
2670914 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2670915 im gonna bust your head till the white meat shows
2670916 now america tell me again why cant i whip that girl
2670917 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2670918 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2670919 bernie youve got to clean up your act next time
2670920 so what was it you were going to tell me
2670921 its a moment of truth for this city people are participating new yorkers are united with their city
2670922 participants start on bikes with back wheels the size and shape of rolling pins and then gradually move up through a succession of eight progressively thinner wheels
2670923 from the new yorker to shrek the art of william steig
2670924 this was not disconnected from the rest of his career
2670925 from the new yorker to shrek the art of william steig
2670926 steig loved children he loved to write he loved to draw
2670927 he said the secret to his success was that he never really grew up
2670928 because he didnt like to draw the same characters multiple times he liked to draw something then move on
2670929 shrek is an anti hero and steig always said the perfect hero is a flawed hero
2670930 wrote notes to the producers which i put in the museum show sharing ideas he had for the script
2670931 the first of the shrek movies is really the closest to his work
2670932 the culture the art world its not a fad of the west thats going to fade away china is a power
2670933 i think there are a lot of opportunities to collaborate and partner for a long time ahead
2670934 i do see in this new generation a new kind of art being made
2670935 maybe not new to the world but certainly new to china the first wave was political pop more direct and obvious work im seeing a much more introspective emotional psychological sexual type of work people investigating themselves and their identity sun xun is asking identity questions about his country where it came from where its going and the worlds perceptions
2670936 half life of a dream contemporary chinese art from the logan collection
2670937 a whole new generation is coming up with a new vision ten or 15 years ago some of these artists didnt have a penny now they are wealthier than i will ever be young people see that you can be an artist in china you can be respected you can make lots of money and you dont have to do traditional chinese landscape painting
2670938 has revealed itself to be more psychologically resonant than the facade of pop iconoclasm and gestures of ironic detachment might readily suggest
2670939 re enact the psychic aftermath of an era in which representations of specific human emotions were replaced with the idealized faces of the revolution
2670940 as the culture changes you see the subject matter changing
2670941 and this is the hotel that people book last people forget im here because im on the west side of town even that being my case the revenues are up
2670942 generally speaking in colorado the markets are relatively flat to declining slightly particularly in april may and june
2670943 its the economy slowing down oil and gas prices going up and a feeling of economic uncertainty among people
2670944 it does seem like its down over the whole state but it does not shock me that greeley is growing that much
2670945 its just been the trend weve seen since weve been opened i think theres a lot more business there than any of us really anticipated
2670946 people are so loyal to the hilton brand and the hampton inn is the first hilton product into the greeley market
2670947 maybe people who would have normally stayed in loveland because of a hilton product there perhaps theyve come to stay in greeley its due in part to the hilton central reservation system
2670948 as ive talked with lodgers month by month theyve noticed an increase in their business activity
2670949 theyre self conscious about people their own age or younger seeing them not able to do something
2670950 we want to know why theyre interested in swimming what prompted them to take the class what their water background is
2670951 we try not to ask what their swimming background is obviously its not a lot if theyre here for a beginner lesson
2670952 you can show a kid i want your arms to do this and theyll copycat you
2670953 you show an adult and theyll ask a thousand questions about why your arm has to move that direction at that angle
2670954 theyre self conscious about people their own age or younger seeing them not able to do something
2670955 and theyre a little self conscious about people they know
2670956 id always say it with a tinge of self deprecation
2670957 to the gentlemen aboard the monte carlo on july 26 at possession point you pulled our dad out of the chilly waters of puget sound and left before we could really thank you so thank you and hopefully you caught other things as well that day
2670958 to the unbelievably insensitive woman who got out of her car and screamed in my face telling me to move my car that was blocking traffic after i had just struck a pedestrian and was calling 911 after telling her this woman needed assistance she responded by screaming that traffic was backed up for three blocks as i helped the poor woman to her feet not one person at the very busy rush hour intersection of rainier and genesee bothered to get out of their cars to offer assistance classy seattle at its finest
2670959 to the wonderful good samaritan on her way to pegasus in west seattle on july 27 i am so appreciative that you took the time to pull your car over to ask if i was ok after i tripped on the sidewalk and landed flat on my face you kindly provided me with first aid items to address my wounded chin and you made sure that i had collected myself before you left from the time and care that you took to stop in the first place to the emotional support provided simply by placing your comforting hand on my arm you made an impact a heartfelt thank you for your tlc
2670960 to all of the coffee stands that allow the girl employees to wear bikinis or less what does that have to do with coffee a double rant to the city of seattle for allowing these coffee stands to do this whats it going to take to stop it these girls should find some self respect and get out
2670961 to the couple who stopped to help my friend who took a bad spill off her bike in ballard they unselfishly loaded up our bikes and drove us back to u village to my car they sacrificed their lunch plans to do that and wouldnt take a dime for gas thanks so much
2670962 the oil looks like cooking oil but is highly toxic
2670963 we have launched an investigation and have found that thieves are bottling the oil adding water and colourants and selling it to township fisheries as cheap cooking oil
2670964 people should be careful where they buy their fried fish and chips or other fried foods from now on
2670965 we are busy with a serious investigation into this peoples lives are at risk
2670966 a railway line is not a thing you can pick up easily and dispose of easily
2670967 i will put the copperheads on to it and see if we can link the dots we need to establish where these things are taking place and work on it
2670968 it is probably premature to say that the end is imminent to all the factors that have accumulated to squeeze consumers
2670969 we estimate that we are at least a year away from notable improvements in the consumers economic environment
2670970 the exchange rate of the rand also plays an important part it has been moving up and down in a very wide range over the past few months if we assume r7 50 to the dollar and an oil price of 105 at year end 93 octane petrol on the reef will cost about r8 56 a litre with the oil price at 60 petrol would be r5 59 a litre but oil at 150 would rocket the petrol price to r11 53 a litre
2670971 after which we might be near the top of the cycle but do not expect any rapid relaxation of monetary policy by the bank it will continue to battle inflationary pressures for months to come
2670972 it is possible but we believe it unlikely that the high interest rate cycle is over
2670973 tough times for consumers are not nearly at an end the downward movement of interest rates might be a year or more away
2670974 when that happens our view is that the reduction in rates will be relatively slow rather than the tumble that took place between 2003 and 2005 when the prime rate moved from 18 percent to 10 5 percent in only two years
2670975 interest rate cycles appear to have entered a period of being longer in duration
2670976 we remain of the view that a combination of weak economic activity and an improved inflation outlook will prompt the reserve bank to leave the rates on hold
2670977 high food and petrol prices coupled with high interest rates have affected consumers adversely the effects of high interest rates are reflected by the high incidence of houses and cars being repossessed by financial institutions
2670978 that does not mean that there is no debt stress there is clearly increased debt stress but bearing in mind the extent to which the cost of living and interest rates have been increasing the vast majority of consumers appear to be making changes to their budgets and spending patterns
2670979 data from credit providers show a drop in credit applications of 40 percent and more with retail clothing and furniture being the most negatively affected
2670980 our advice to consumers is that they must apply restraint and avoid new debt
2670981 consumers cant tighten their belts any further they are at the end of trying they are now borrowing money to pay for basics such as food and health care
2670982 his body is shutting down it seems to me and theres not much that can be done about it this thing is turning into a virtual death sentence
2670983 i have the medical reports from the prison doctors and i have seen schabir there is not much more to say
2670984 he had to go into the intensive care unit icu at luthuli twice because it was feared that the onset of a stroke was imminent
2670985 this can be treated with drugs but the problem is that the body grows progressively less responsive to the medication and then organ damage begins
2670986 i think its commonly accepted that many indian males are plagued by diabetes high cholesterol and high blood pressure and schabir has serious problems with the last two and i think hes developing diabetic problems rapidly
2670987 obviously this is a family problem but whereas the rest of us can monitor it and whereas schabir did his best to take care of it before he went to jail it seems clear that the five year ordeal of his investigation and trial and then going to jail tipped him over the edge
2670988 the department could if it wanted release him into correctional supervision at home or some kind of parole
2670989 there seems to be some kind of hangover from the apartheid days people who get really sick in jail and with whom the prison hospitals cant deal and who ought to be released on that basis are just never released they eventually get sent home in a body bag
2670990 i want to believe that the provisions of the legislation dealing with a matter like this are known to all those who are interested and the shaiks should be using legal channels for this matter
2670991 shawn i just want to say im so proud of you mijo
2670992 it doesnt matter if you dont win a medal you made your dreams come true im sorry shawn that i cant be with you in china i love you
2670993 i kind of already knew what he had what he was going to bring
2670994 but i kept my composure and finished the rounds ahead on points and i did what i had to do
2670995 i heard my family i appreciate the big support i try to look at them and it makes me fight a little bit more
2670996 hes a kid whos going to be going against men
2670997 because cathy is an artist i used bright iridescent colors in interesting combinations like chartreuse lavender lots of purple
2670998 i wanted the garden to be easy non fussy a beach garden
2670999 because this is just a summer garden it fires on all cylinders in june july and august
2671000 i like the garden to be a little crazy and wild
2671001 it was a good creative process scott listens yet he pushes his good ideas he makes my ideas better
2671002 cathy didnt like the idea of heather but i knew we needed an expanse that would be open like lawn without needing all that care or water
2671003 i dont think being first is especially significant to me
2671004 this was competing on home territory so i had special support from the crowd especially the chinese fans
2671005 so i dont think i was under great pressure what i was thinking of was to make every attempt good
2671006 polling tells us that americans are still not tuned into
2671007 fight s speculation driving up prices of oil and food
2671008 the vice president looks forward to participating in the republican national convention and continuing to work for the election of sen mccain and other republican candidates in the coming months
2671009 these people georgians think that under the protection of their foreign sponsors they can feel comfortable and secure
2671010 the fact that deputy tollison took his closed fist and struck the suspect in the face 13 times in my opinion was excessive
2671011 then they have the audacity to treat this man as if hes a piece of meat and taser him with electrical jolts to his body and then thats not enough
2671012 i feel like a whole different person did each of these books
2671013 and i cried the whole way through the interview bill reminds me of my father
2671014 the stories people told me were the stories i needed
2671015 dead people talk to the living this was the most spiritual thing ive ever written it was as if colton had lived for a book
2671016 young guys think working on a drilling rig is sexy like being a test pilot
2671017 he lived every day as if it would be his last drilling wasnt about money for him it was about being like his dad
2671018 his death made me look at my own life working 90 hours a week missing so much of my life
2671019 its a way of life accidents are inevitable colton knew he was required to have fall protection especially on an icy deck there should have been handrails
2671020 i cant believe it ive been up twenty four hours with another accident and now i got to deal with this bullshit
2671021 if theres one thing these companies are good at its drug testing
2671022 something makes me want to write about your friend something greater than you and me
2671023 many tries for conservation by people who love the place have come and gone over the decades
2671024 defeated by the prevailing attitude of show me the money by the congressional cold shoulder by lack of knowledge of what is in that high desert by the complex mixture of politics and culture and by the momentum of our times inexorably propelled by shifting global histories which like massive continental plates have thrust us into the present
2671025 theres only so much they can take away from us writers
2671026 they the teeth are absolutely invaluable it underpins everything that we learn about these animals theyre kind of like gold
2671027 having the teeth is quite unique because they were whole family pods and you dont get access to pods in any other way
2671028 to study these animals in the wild if theyre still alive and swimming around you just cant do it so even if you went to do biopsies for skin samples you just cant do it you never get the whole pod
2671029 you can count those ridges and it basically gives you the age of the animal
2671030 what tends to happen is if one individual has stranded the social bonds between that group mean that the rest of the group dont want to leave the area without that individual
2671031 max wahlberg is forced to battle enemies beyond the natural world
2671032 as the mystery deepens max wahlberg is forced to battle enemies beyond the natural world and face an unthinkable betrayal
2671033 as the mystery deepens max wahlberg is forced to battle enemies beyond the natural world and face an unthinkable betrayal
2671034 the hallucinations are a side effect of this drug thats been leaked onto the streets
2671035 a lot of the conspiracy comes from that max finds out that its a drug tested by the military to create super soldiers but someone has flooded the streets with it it makes crack look like chocolate he has to take it to keep up with the fight but yeah theres a definite theme of max fighting the devils inside theres a lot of action in this movie but theres also plenty of emotion and psychology it goes pretty deep
2671036 whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might
2671037 there is time enough for everything in the course of a day if we do but one thing at a time but there is not time enough in a year if we try to do two things at a time
2671038 but we must learn to let go to relax completely before each period of in tense concentration here is the working principle relaxation precedes perfect concentration a delightful illustration of this point is given by elizabeth towne six puppies were playing in the barn the barn door was closed and with the world shut out they were giving themselves up completely to the spirit of play two of them were staging a mock battle over a feather while the others were rolling over and over in the loose straw on the barn floor in utter enjoyment suddenly the barn door softly creaked instantly every puppy came to attention heads up tails up bodies rigid bright eyes fixed in intense concentration on that door as it slowly swung open a moment before they had been in a state of complete relaxation now they offered a perfect example of concentration as they stood at attention waiting and watching for the unknown danger that might be coming from the other side of the barn door all great mental achievement has been preceded by periods of absolute rest or relaxtion during this time fatigue disappears the nervous forces recuperate and the minds stores up fresh energy axed establishes a reserve to draw upon during
2671039 of relaxation will which he pointed out that continual tress and strain high tension without periods relaxation were responsible for much chronic fatigue and many a nervous breakdown
2671040 solitude is to genius the stern friend the cold obscure shelter where mould the wings which will bear it farther than suns or stars
2671041 silence is the element in which great things fashion themselves together that at length they may emerge full formed and mamestic into the delight of life which they are henceforth to rule
2671042 what a college and a crowd could not do for thousands of young men solitude did for the son alone he sailed the seas of thought with god for his only companion till at last he stood forth a mountain minded man
2671043 rielle is a private individual she is not running for public office she wishes to maintain her privacy and her daughters privacy
2671044 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2671045 the open web rules and the proprietary web is evil
2671046 rest is not idleness and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summers day listening to the murmur of the water or watching the clouds float across the sky is by no means a waste of time
2671047 when you sell antiques and vintage pieces it is hard to keep a store full
2671048 because of gas prices they could not afford to come back and drive
2671049 your happiness and your pleasure is entirely up to you you have to work and earn it and install your own moral values
2671050 complaint of the west against radical islam why do they have to keep asking god why cant they as it were make up their own minds well its much harder to install your own moral values than to have them imposed by other people or by the system
2671051 i did an internship this summer with gly construction so im trying to find a little niche there i just always liked buildings and architecture and my cousin is into that too so i just thought it would be something i would like
2671052 his last one graduation thats my favorite cd i just like everything he does people try to say hes cocky and what not but he doesnt let what people say get to him
2671053 i like it a lot ive been practicing all summer with my footwork and my eye progression at corner so ive been getting better
2671054 brandon was a little slower today than we thought but hell be ok
2671055 a minor strain of the hamstring on the outside of his left leg
2671056 it wasnt to the backside it was more to the side
2671057 and they said that would be something that would be a quicker heal for him they said if it was going to have to happen that would be one of the better places for it
2671058 they cant really give a time frame because it depends on how they heal but a uw trainer said he didnt think it would be too long and he would be back to ready to go
2671059 i have little doubt hell be on the field at oregon
2671060 but uw trainers have got it wrapped so tight because they want to keep it immobilized
2671061 we said itd be day by day hell be ready pretty soon and away we go
2671062 but i dont expect him to be anything but good what ronnie fouch is doing is what weve seen from him before its nothing new nothing unexpected
2671063 but thats not the presidents guess or the search committees
2671064 personally its time for me to do one job full time
2671065 here we have to be methodical and have a process get a search committee going they can just up and make a hire its a totally different animal
2671066 so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from god
2671067 go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor the crippled the blind and the lame
2671068 our initial idea was to empower users by creating a venue for demand seekers and solution providers this system has since evolved and will soon be a global lead delivery system this is just the first phase and a taste of where post net is headed
2671069 soon our users will have the ability to create custom sub portals and have the ability to advertise their own brands within the network this system is a testament to the evolution of technology with daily human interactions
2671070 come by shinkansen and stay at my house and go to a restaurant where we can have spaghetti pizza and dessert
2671071 what is your program for tackling the problems of poverty and oppression are you not the victim of an illusion if you imagine that a program for creating economic justice on a world scale will unite mankind is it not precisely in the conflict of ideologies that use words like justice and freedom as their slogans that the most murderous conflicts are generated what is your program for the unity of of humankind around what center and in what organized form do you propose to unite mankind
2671072 our imaginations have to be revamped to take in this large immense world of gods revelation in contrast to the small cramped world of
2671073 yang kau buang buang itu bisa jadi baik bagimu yang kau junjung junjung itu bisa jadi mencelakakanmu
2671074 hai segala manusia aku telah menjadikan kamu sekalian dari laki laki dan perempuan serta aku jadikan berbangsa bangsa dan bergolongan golongan supaya kamu sekalian berkenal kenalan sesungguhnya yang termulia pada hadirat allah itu ialah kamu yang terlebih takwa bakti kepada nya sesungguhnya allah itu maha mengetahui lagi bijaksana
2671075 allah tidak melarang kamu berbuat baik dan berlaku adil kepada orang orang yang tidak memerangi kamu lantaran agama kamu dan tidak mengusir mengeluarkan kamu dari negeri kamu sesungguhnya allah suka kepada orang orang yang berlaku adil
2671076 im not sure that amy has the proper image that ben amp jerrys wants to be connected with
2671077 theres this perfectly nice allegedly a 14 year old girl looks to be about 60
2671078 im surprised that he lowered himself to pick on a child and act like a child himself
2671079 yeah they offered me the role but its not really what i see for myself
2671080 there are at least six other famous women pregnant right now who arent getting picked on
2671081 it was a wonderful kind of artistic event and the twin towers provided the stage
2671082 i knew the story like many people who live in the city just as an anecdote that you collect or absorb by living here almost like a folk memory
2671083 and the fact that his life well philippe would say it wasnt at stake but everyone else knows that it was
2671084 one of the things that struck me as i made man on wire was that we were sort of re creating a new york that i wished still existed
2671085 its all caught up in the destruction of the twin towers ultimately
2671086 and in fact the new york of 1974 and the world trade center walk is a world id much rather live in i guess theres nostalgia about that which maybe is a dangerous emotion but nostalgia also has a kind of ache to it
2671087 it does bring back and evoke this city that we are in danger of losing completely
2671088 i felt that the choice of not engaging with the destruction of those buildings was essential
2671089 because everybodys going to be engaged with it anyway its the big fact the big documentary fact if you like its the defining fact perhaps
2671090 and the idea for me making the film was to get people not beyond it how could you but at least to a point where you could enjoy the towers being built and you could enjoy this sort of fantasy thats being projected onto them by this obsessed frenchman
2671091 you see the buildings really almost exclusively through his eyes in the film and that then becomes a legitimate way of bringing them back to life i think youre seeing them through someone who knew them knew their secrets and their secret noises because he spent so much time there as they were being finished as they were being built
2671092 if you told it as it was with the people involved you couldnt do any better than that
2671093 its a struggle to be a filmmaker in the u s and ive just given up on it now
2671094 its almost perverse to keep pretending im an american filmmaker
2671095 they knew full well that she had no access to her journalistic work product after they abruptly terminated her
2671096 were going to play on everything good that people know about wysp
2671097 nbc15 will allow me more creativity than i had in philadelphia
2671098 if its slower than me dumber than me and tastes reasonably good pass the salt
2671099 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
2671100 there is nothing that will take place today itll be tomorrow

2671110 the competition was a victory for sport because sport stands for friendship we have had so many big wars in the 20th century what we need is peace that is something politics can learn from sport
2671111 it shows that sport is the perfect example of bringing people together
2671112 it is very difficult for us georgians because of everything that is going on at home
2671113 last night the president mikheil saakashvili called and told us we better stay in beijing
2671114 they will continue participating in the games this reflects the olympic spirit and the value of the games the ioc says it is the right decision
2671115 they are participating in sport against whichever team they meet they are here to stay and to compete at the olympics
2671116 the olympic truce is the heart of what our values stand for
2671117 garrison mill thats where we want to be we love it we love it going to garrison mill
2671118 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan

2671120 the moneys there somewhere just let me take another look
2671121 to know and not to do is really not to know
2671122 make sure that your past does not hold your future hostage
2671123 this is clearly a criminal act in support of a campaign which has been committed with or without their knowledge
2671124 the question is will we see more and more of this or will this bring shame to the campaigns and will they make clear that this is not a form of acceptable behavior by their supporters
2671125 the interesting thing was that we had the same subject line from the same ip address and it claimed to be from different users from within the united states
2671126 i have not seen a malicious code sample yet that is sending these mails therefore i would say its likely that either they are using a botnet or they are using open relays
2671127 if it is true it could be done by a well intentioned yet misguided supporter or someone with bad intentions trying to embarrass the campaign
2671128 either way this is independent work and we have no connection

2671139 for the sake of the environment it is critical to look at future steel vehicle as all vehicles from a life cycle assessment lca perspective
2671140 based on the recent lca study and model developed at the university of california santa barbara implementation of more efficient powertrain systems elevates the importance of the emissions from material production placing greater emphasis on selecting a low greenhouse gas intensive material such as steel
2671141 compared to other materials used to reduce vehicle weight these advanced high strength steels produce five to 15 times less ghg emissions during the material manufacturing phase which greatly reduces a vehicles life cycle carbon footprint
2671142 were not just looking at the vehicle design and its impact on ghg at the tailpipe
2671143 were concerned with the whole life cycle of the vehicle from the emissions produced and energy used to create raw materials all the way to the impact of recycling if the whole life cycle is not taken into account there is the distinct possibility of having a net increase in ghg if the wrong material choice is made this isnt just speculation weve got very clear models that demonstrate this

2671150 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2671151 the absence of our great poet mahmud darwish the love of palestine and the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2671152 darwish is the essential breath of the palestinian people the eloquent witness of exile and belonging

2671160 bts retail market share of net additions of dsl and llu connections in the quarter was 31 per cent the eighth consecutive quarter of achieving 30 per cent market share or more the bt total broadband offering was further enhanced in july with the launch of the next generation hub 2 0 offering our customers the latest wireless functionality and increased security in addition we launched the bt total broadband anywhere package in may combining bt togo and bt total broadband services in the home the installed base of bt togo customers was 34 000 by june 30 2008
2671161 i believe investment in nga is essential for bt and it should generate a good return for decades to come on the other hand if bt doesnt renew its local loop infrastructure its existing copper network will be worth only scrap value within 10 years
2671162 fibre in the local loop combined with bts 21cn project allows bt to provide a complete ip based telecoms environment to the end user customers should get more flexibility for less cost and dreams like seamless fixed mobile convergence will become reality
2671163 bt stands to make good margins on this first phase of its next generation investment and needs to earn only about 3 per month per household for a good return
2671164 of course even 3 a month would be a heavy extra burden to put on the price of broadband services but the 3 is for the partial replacement of what broadband customers are already buying not for something additional
2671165 bt will also get lots of benefits from cost savings and other new services besides basic broadband so i dont think the nga investment should increase the cost of broadband overall although people will get a lot more for their money
2671166 innovative additional services and falling prices are helping the connections business to achieve vigorous growth fast internet connections are being offered today in combination with low priced telephone flat rates or online on demand services for movies and music
2671167 bpi has always believed that a partnership approach is the best way forward as we showed with our education campaign with virgin media launched in may
2671168 in addition the music business is constantly innovating to offer new safe and legal ways to enjoy music online and to create a future for digital music where creativity and copyright are respected this mou will help to create an environment in which such new digital services models can flourish
2671169 we expected the launch day to be very much an awareness raising event among partners with our sales teams and marketing communications promoting the availability of entanet 2plus broadband however we were delighted to see orders coming through immediately with customers modifying their existing adsl connection to adsl2 whats more some of these customers were even live on adsl2 within a couple of hours
2671170 taking wbc is a significant part of our strategy and puts us in an enviable position to launch both resale and wholesale adsl2 broadband to the market well ahead of cps who are looking to offer services based on bts more restricted managed wbc platform
2671171 starbucks decision to go to a virtually free wi fi hotspot model is having a profound impact hotspot owners are beginning to see wi fi as a cost of doing business and an operational expense rather than as a profit center
2671172 the first phase is likely to be a free or almost free service for good customers those who have signed up for loyalty cards charging for service is counter productive in the long run because the real money will be in value add content downloads
2671173 we are working on propositions across a number of sectors we have to be thinking in terms of what clawbacks there might be there are propositions we are working through right now this is flavour of the month but we have to ensure it is not a cashback flavour of the month
2671174 broadband has boosted the uk economy and is now an essential part of our customers lives we now want to make a step change in broadband provision which will offer faster speeds than ever before this marks the beginning of a new chapter in britains broadband story this is a bold step by bt and we need others to be just as bold we are keen to partner with people who share our vision for the next phase of the broadband revolution we want to work with local and regional bodies to decide where and when we should focus the deployment our aim is that urban and rural areas alike will benefit from our investment
2671175 the new hub will give you up to twice the wireless range of our competitors giving our customers much more coverage in the home even in those difficult to reach areas and more freedom to use their broadband wirelessly from wherever they want whether in the living room bedroom or even in a garden the n standard technology also helps to prevent your wireless connection from annoyingly disappearing by providing a much more efficient wireless signal put simply our new home hub reaches the parts other hubs cannot reach
2671176 the research shows that wireless networking is now a mass market technology and not only for the tech savvy consumer that very same consumer is the owner of their network and tools like our linksys easylink advisor help the consumer make sure that the network fulfils their expectations
2671177 the consumer is by no means a computer network administrator he or she is purely interested in the application of the network for tasks like accessing the internet wirelessly or printing wirelessly it is the application that counts and we enable this through the network as the platform
2671178 this is another major step in the preparatory work we are progressing so that people living in the northern isles can share in the benefits that our next generation network will bring
2671179 nearly 60 exchanges in the islands from the largest to the smallest will have existing equipment removed and replaced with 21st century kit
2671180 and it will be well worth the wait because every exchange no matter how remote will have the same capability as a city centre exchange
2671181 our test solutions have a proven track record since 2003 in the uk and europe helping service providers resolve complex faults correctly the first time lowering customer churn improving quality of service and reducing mean time to repair
2671182 industry increasingly looks to upgrade from the traditional copper network to the new fibre connections to meet the demand for greater speed to ensure it is competitive and above all can be developed to benefit britains broadband consumers at the earliest possible opportunity

2671210 la existencia aqu es dura pero estamos acostumbrados es parte de nuestra cultura a mi no me gusta estar en los campamentos de refugiados de argelia ni en las zonas ocupadas por marruecos vivir libre a pesar de las dificultades es lo mejor
2671211 desde aqu pod is observar los tanques los soldados y a veces sus aeronaves es una amenaza constante pero esta es mi tierra y de aqu no me van a echar
2671212 los restos del lucrativo negocio de las armas se encuentran por todas partes y lamentablemente muchos de los pa ses con responsabilidades hist ricas que pretenden mostrarse como mediadores neutrales se ven directamente involucrados en el desproporcionado rearme del ej rcito ocupante
2671213 obviamente este es el caso de espa a y francia
2671214 al pueblo saharaui no lo ha organizado ni las agencias de ayuda humanitaria de las naciones unidas ni ning n gobierno u ong fueron ellos mismos quienes mostraron una incre ble capacidad para crear estructuras en medio de la nada las mujeres mostraron una fortaleza y determinaci n decisiva que perdura hasta nuestros d as
2671215 se trata de una medida temporal pues para ellos es importante recordar que todo esto se realiz siempre con la idea de regresar a su tierra
2671216 es que la gente solo visualiza los campamentos de refugiados de tindouf y no sabe que ya existe un territorio liberado adem s del ocupado
2671217 el sahara occidental tiene cientos de kil metros de playas y mar ciudades y minas muy ricas no es un p ramo como a veces se da a entender
2671218 la gente en los territorios ocupados lo pasa muy mal los activistas pro derechos humanos son torturados desaparecidos y encarcelados si hubiese una orden pol tica de acudir en su auxilio la acatar a ahora mismo
2671219 aparentemente la milicia del polisario cuenta con un material militar que dif cilmente podr a contrarrestar la capacidad ofensiva de la dictadura marroqu pero esto mismo se pens en los setenta y la sorpresa fue que aguantamos y golpeamos durante mas de quince a os hasta el d a de hoy la voluntad de un pueblo es su mejor arma
2671220 aqu lo que hay es un claro intercambio entre espa a y marruecos si marruecos contiene la emigraci n ilegal espa a se calla sobre el sahara si espa a les vende tanques marruecos les deja el banco pesquero saharaui y as con la droga el terrorismo isl mico etc que me perdonen pero es la verdad
2671221 pero para nosotros lo mas doloroso es lo del psoe desde que felipe gonz lez vino aqu en los setenta hablando sobre nuestro derecho a la autodeterminaci n hasta la actualidad con moratinos hemos recibido una pu alada por la espalda tras otra al menos con en el pp sabemos que no tenemos nada
2671222 la mejor a y la buena vecindad que el pp nunca tuvo con marruecos
2671223 es como poner tiritas a un herido que se est desangrando
2671224 aqu cada observador de la onu tiene un veh culo nuevo un sueldo de ocho mil euros al mes los mejores hoteles helic pteros y todo para que qu observan cu ndo nos ayudan somos arrestados y torturados de manera sistem tica y ellos no hacen mas que mirar para otro lado
2671225 la represi n ha aprendido de nuevas formas de tortura menos obvias pero igual de terror ficas como son la ba era la bolsa y el pollo
2671226 los traen en camiones y autobuses desde las zonas mas deprimidas del reino llegan exhaustos y los dejan tirados a su suerte en la costa aunque ellos no sufren la violencia sistem tica que nosotros soportamos tambi n ellos son maltratados por el r gimen absolutista nuestra lucha no es contra el pueblo marroqu sino contra el rey mohamed vi y sus militares corruptos
2671227 lo est n empezando a hacer con los activistas mas valientes que como suele suceder muy a menudo son los mas j venes los violan y despu s los dejan abandonados en el desierto eso para la dignidad del saharaui es algo muy duro
2671228 eso es un infierno al que la onu no presta ninguna atenci n all se cometen cientos de abusos de los derechos humanos adem s de desapariciones forzadas hay mucha gente que ha sido arrestada y no se le ha vuelto a ver
2671229 quieren perder tiempo y asimilarnos que nos disolvamos en marruecos al igual que en otros conflictos el tiempo siempre juega a favor del ocupante aqu por ejemplo ya hay una especie de junta de saharauis pro marroqu es que viven muy bien es triste reconocerlo pero empiezan a ser muchos los que no han aguantado y se han vendido
2671230 incluso en el caso de que acept semos la falsa autonom a impuesta por rabat no vivir amos en un estado de derecho pues el marco de una monarqu a absolutista no es garante de nada aqu es hasta ilegal cuestionar de manera pacifica la integridad territorial qu futuro nos espera en un pa s as
2671231 marruecos no quiere un refer ndum de ninguna forma nosotros hemos aceptado incluso que todos los marroqu es que vinieron aqu antes de 1999 puedan votar pero ni a n as quieren permitirnos autodeterminarnos
2671232 las madres las estudiantes y las hijas nos organizamos junto con nuestros compa eros en la mas absoluta clandestinidad
2671233 y por supuesto tambi n sufrimos las palizas o los golpes de la polic a en nuestras manifestaciones no se vaya a pensar que por ser mujeres nos pegan menos
2671234 grabamos nuestras acciones y las colgamos en internet tenemos la esperanza de que la gente nos vea resistir y se sume a nuestras reivindicaciones democr ticas all en europa les importa mucho la democracia verdad

2671237 le hicieron un n mero ocho al compa ero fulano de tal
2671238 they told me that i was a hero and that they wished they could do the same in their countries
2671239 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2671240 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2671241 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2671242 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2671243 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2671244 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2671245 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2671246 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2671247 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2671248 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men

2671258 they know you and you know them so theres no real advantage there its more an emotional thing
2671259 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2671260 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2671261 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2671262 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2671263 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2671264 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2671265 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2671266 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2671267 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
2671268 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2671269 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2671270 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2671271 four dollars a gallon gas gets over that very quickly
2671272 energy cost is the first thing that people mention to me every day we need to become the state that says alternative energy sources are important to us we need to be helping people with manufacturing solar panels and windmill parts creating those jobs in north carolina once we do that those jobs arent going to be outsourced
2671273 were not sure how long it would take on some of the development there
2671274 i think weve got to do it all we need that comprehensive policy
2671275 the price mechanism of the free market is an amazing thing
2671276 without deliberate attention by anyone it devotes the most attention and resources to the most efficient source of energy possible
2671277 the less the government is involved the more efficient the market would be
2671278 neither is talking a lot about the role of nuclear power in the role of energy production
2671279 both candidates reflect their national parties in terms of their plans
2671280 kay hagan is a hypocrite of the highest order for attacking senator dole for being too close to oil interests when she herself is an oil baroness and is profiting from the very product she is condemning
2671281 it is no wonder that hagan has no energy plan she is profiting from the status quo
2671282 and the devil taking him up into an high mountain shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will i give it if thou therefore wilt worship me all shall be thine
2671283 hello first national bank hi how are you im just calling to tell you um that ive been embezzling for um the last four years heh heh i sincerely apologize heh heh really heh heh
2671284 and an increase of 157 in controlled substance you could actually say that was the whole increase basically thats what fueled it
2671285 there was more aggressive investigation and arrests we probably did more drug sweeps with the dogs than weve done in the past and frankly its available everywhere
2671286 one of the things i hear from the kids is its just so easy to get their hands on marijuana i even had one kid tell me its harder to buy cigarettes than it is to buy marijuana cigarettes youve got to have id
2671287 you have to understand working in a school is like a mini city
2671288 the school resource officer will take care of anything that happens in the day to day business of their city
2671289 the high schools got what 2 400 students and theres another 1 100 in the middle school next door
2671290 im not sure of the population of biscoe or seagrove but thats probably about the same size these schools are their own little community for nine hours a day
2671291 youre not going to see any bullying shoving matches simple assaults burglaries things like that
2671292 this is a very specific report and its just for very specific offenses
2671293 thats not to say they didnt have any incidents they just didnt have any that matched the descriptions of these 17 incidents that go to the state
2671294 well that doesnt happen you can see which one of them has really done their homework
2671295 if shoppers went out while the item was tax free and on a good sale maybe they bought another notebook or something for their childs class or another pair of jeans with the savings
2671296 i love being able to walk to the grocery store
2671297 you dont have the lifestyle like this you dont have everything right here its not half as appealing
2671298 we can often sit there in the evening and watch the world go by
2671299 there are a lot of choices in the conventional suburban areas what were seeing is more choices in a more urban lifestyle
2671300 a lot of people around this age group tend to want to live in urban areas
2671301 i really didnt see anything i liked in a lot of the suburban complexes
2671302 they didnt know how to deal with something that was part residential and part commercial now its a little more common
2671303 when you see what it is that the mix of uses is complementary it becomes more acceptable
2671304 were actually a little bit behind the curve here in greensboro
2671305 with gas prices rising sprawl is becoming a real risk factor in real estate
2671306 thats kind of what southside did it proved there was a market
2671307 its just kind of a match made in heaven youre kind of killing two birds with one stone
2671308 they want to live in the building above port city java
2671309 you have to make sure you dont have partying going on upstairs or downstairs that interferes with the other
2671310 its easier to go out to the edge of town and grow horizontally rather than vertically
2671311 theres a lot to make people think about changing their travel habits
2671312 i had the opportunity to take classes with world class scholars in college but didnt take the initiative to meet them personally
2671313 i later wished that i had pushed myself a little harder to go up to them after class or see them in their offices
2671314 and i found professors who were willing to take a personal interest in me and help me grow in my own learning
2671315 one of our classic texts teaches the bashful student does not learn whether bashful or um just unmotivated thats a good lesson
2671316 when i began college 60 miles away from my small farming community in indiana it was like i had been dropped off on another planet
2671317 as i often tell my students i not only lived through the 60s i can remember them since i didnt do drugs
2671318 folks were going down in flames experimenting with mind altering substances
2671319 my quaker faith which teaches that it is of paramount importance to keep the mind clear as god communicates directly to each person and wed darn well better be clear headed when she chooses to talk saw me through unscathed
2671320 and honestly the young people i know are much wiser than i was at that age i often feel i am learning from them
2671321 my hope is theyll trust that deep inner wisdom because that is one of the ways god speaks to us
2671322 and as always i hope my daughter will remember to call her mother
2671323 whatever you do reflects upon your family as well as you
2671324 as a result there were parties and things that i didnt get invited to but i found out that wasnt the end of the world
2671325 our personalities are more malleable during these years than they will be again many of the vices that are considered necessary for college life are easy to put on and hell to take off they become marbleized into our personality growing as we mature so they are not easy to extract
2671326 he could kick my tail running with his long legs and not even breathe hard
2671327 he would talk about theology or women or both while i wheezed trying to keep up
2671328 im the furthest thing from a prude there is a great goodness to life that god has given us that is meant to be enjoyed including alcohol and sex
2671329 however many destructive habits like abusing alcohol dipping smokeless smoking cigs or weed cruising porn etc began in our college years when they were considered hip long before they started to scab over
2671330 after several months of sitting in front of a computer scanning documents i realized i was not cut out for work in the business office
2671331 not long after i accepted an opportunity to work in admissions and serve as a host for visitors and guide for prospective students this was a perfect match and i ended up loving it
2671332 i falsely believed the approval of others forged my identity
2671333 when others see our confidence they will either choose to associate with us or find another friend
2671334 experience and training prepare us for gainful employment but without passion our work is just a job
2671335 there are lots of challenges in particular the recent hike in fuel prices and there have been six so far this year with the last one being very exorbitant
2671336 this places the company in a very difficult position as a good chunk of our costs goes to fuel and running the organisation

2671345 that i didnt see what i thought was going on was that they were like what the joke was from a lot of fans was like dont trip over a water backstage at a

2671347 we have not sold out and continuously for 20 years every arena because we care about just our appearance the music comes first
2671348 def leppard shouldnt be knocking anyone about their music since they just did a show called dancing with the stars in the u s and they got crucified because they fucking lip synched the entire show so before they bust anyones balls ive never lip synched a fucking thing in my life ever its the pot calling the kettle black

2671456 it is known that most gcc countries have limited fiscal tools at present to tackle inflation because of the peg between their currencies and the us dollar matching the us in cutting interest rates will only aggravate their liquidity problem
2671457 their only alternative now is to increase bank reserve requirements as was the case in saudi arabia or mop up liquidity through cds bonds or other instruments freezing or introducing price caps is only a temporary solution
2671458 the statistics division at dpe has selected a large list of food items and set prices for them so it will closely monitor the price movement on a weekly basis during ramadan the list includes all the basic needs of consumers and the index will be published on a weekly basis during ramadan
2671459 as for the past two months the dpe found that the rise in the index was a result of an increase in the prices of some basic items especially fish
2671460 the reason was that the fish at the society was obtained from another supplier who had signed an agreement to get 10 per cent to 20 per cent profit that supplier said he was charging more because the fish was imported from dubai and was quite different from the one available in abu dhabi besides the ice used to store it had also increased
2671461 a team from the trade protection section contacted the main rice supplier and it was found that the official price was dh35 6 the team then alerted abu dhabi co operative societies and they responded by reducing the price from dh62 to dh42 5
2671462 in a bid to maintain consumer awareness at the highest possible level the department of planning and economy in abu dhabi has launched a commodity index to monitor price trends of essential commodities
2671463 the commodity prices index is a vital project that would help create a positive and competitive climate for prices in abu dhabi

2671471 denver was a city run by city bosses really from the 1880s through mayor ben stapleton which means in the 1940s
2671472 whatever you can say about it mayors could get things done the price was it was not a very democratic way of doing business
2671473 a lot of the real decisions were not made in the convention but at the brown palace and at the albany hotel

2671479 this gene has been associated with a combination of kidney and eye disease in human patients
2671480 here we found a mutation that affects only the eyes suggesting that this gene might be a candidate for human patients with eye disease only
2671481 the new information that the nphp4 gene can be involved in eye diseases only can shed light on the etiology of some low frequency eye diseases in people where similar mutations may be involved
2671482 though there were areas of overlap we found that common motivations for self benefit included interaction with the birds a sense of achievement social interaction personal stimulation and enjoyment
2671483 past research shows that people take part in wildlife activities for many reasons and so require a sophisticated level of management our findings reinforce that
2671484 though self satisfaction motivations were mentioned most often people also had many unselfish reasons for taking part in conservation including helping this vulnerable species preserving nature for future generations and serving the community
2671485 with declining budgets most wildlife agencies are not well equipped to manage the growing number of species at risk so they are depending more on volunteers to help with wildlife management operations
2671486 the experiments by our collaborators at the university of california san diego demonstrated that this mechanism is present and our theory explained why and how it happens

2671498 its replacement could be wiisports a pentathlon of tennis bowling golf baseball and boxing
2671499 theres plenty of skill involved with perfecting the tennis power serve or getting the right spin on a bowling ball
2671500 there would also be the added joy of seeing a 9 year old win the gold medal
2671501 you found a dead body down the street every week
2671502 i tell him theres a naked fellow in the plane he said omigod can you show me
2671503 looking back im thinking theres not many naked people on this plane
2671504 its a bit like having a football league with no footballs
2671505 i tested it i threw it in the pool and it didnt move at all so ill still have to swim
2671506 here is a better idea use instant replay to double check birth certificates
2671507 shes always done what she thought she should do not what anyone else thinks she should do
2671508 shes been thinking about the olympics forever and she just decided im going to do it and nobodys going to stop me from doing it its amazing to me to see the kind of focus she has
2671509 before the race i told each of my teammates i wouldnt want anyone else to be on that relay with me swimming against them for the past four years in college those were the girls i was afraid of racing
2671510 its hard for people to understand how hard that is
2671511 you have to swim a specific time theres nobody to race youre in the pool by yourself and you have that weight thats telling you i have to perform or else to do it by yourself it was amazing she could go that fast
2671512 after the surgery the doctors told her we think youll be ready in a month but we dont know
2671513 we kept going up and down but shes been very upbeat shes had maybe one or two days where she was down
2671514 i left the hospital telling everyone i was going to be at my best
2671515 i was going to be able to swim i tried to stay positive i only broke down once i cried but it was just that one time
2671516 my parents came to my hotel room after it happened and i wasnt crying and i said to them i need you guys to stay positive i dont want you to cry i told them it was going to be ok
2671517 i said from day 1 our goal was to go to the world series the kids believed the whole time and they backed it up with action

2671525 i didnt expect them to be able to do some things against our defense that they did early
2671526 i dont think we tackled as well as we want to we missed a couple tackles that allowed some cheap extra yards some assignment errors that allowed some more cheap yards
2671527 i was empty at the end just in terms of fuel i just havent had seven hour rides
2671528 the guy that i raced today wasnt the guy who won the tours so i dont put myself in that category
2671529 at the end i realized i was thoroughly cooked but i said i am having a good time
2671530 an inch to the right it would have hit my spine
2671531 an inch to the left it would have hit a vital organ
2671532 im glad they are feisty but we aint got time to wait on them to get through fighting
2671533 you have to understand what liz bachman is to usa volleyball
2671534 shes probably the nicest person in the entire world her and her family her family is like our family
2671535 i told them we had to be strong that we had to show the spirit
2671536 its very difficult for players to move on when they have like three hours to deal with everything
2671537 the tragedy that happened with liz bachman is something that not only could happen to liz bachman but it could happen to anybody in the world
2671538 its still a tragedy but unfortunately it happened to one of our teammates
2671539 it feels like you have hot cream all over your body
2671540 we said what is this were not really sure what it is
2671541 some people say haze and some people say humidity it is best to give things like this a happy name

2671545 i knew he was a little bit slow and i could see us catching him and to get him on the last corner was pretty fantastic
2671546 i think this is the view dario had on the last lap in chicago last year
2671547 i just feel like a weight is off my shoulders just a huge relief
2671548 weve come close we havent been able to close the deal ive had to be patient
2671549 we felt it was the best thing that could happen for us
2671550 not necessarily can we win or how were going to play but to feel the olympic experience and to feel what an opposing crowd might be and the intensity might be
2671551 to have that experience right out of the chute i think is good for us
2671552 i dont know if either one of us has a lot to be proud of today
2671553 i think both of us will be looking to get some momentum in the morning hoping it will carry us through on whats going to be a long day
2671554 its a pretty difficult offense to learn and im sure the one ive been in the last 16 years has been difficult too itll take some time but i think well be fine
2671555 that seems like so long ago it seems like a dream
2671556 im not going to sit here and tell you that ive got this offense down that i know every guy in the locker room or they know me
2671557 its a routine and im just kind of following them thats different for me
2671558 i was really surprised that today i was as effective as i was and im not saying that that was good
2671559 im just saying i was able to take a snap call a play we were able to break a huddle and i was able to complete passes in some sort of rhythm
2671560 ive been tempted for a while especially with this horse to try american racing
2671561 there was no need for johnny to keep us in like that
2671562 i took the lead because i wanted to run my race
2671563 and he responded very well for me he quickened when i asked him to so i never saw what was happening behind me
2671564 it felt great for us as a team to move the ball that way
2671565 we continued to keep fighting and we persevered through all of those penalties and i think that it shows the character and focus of this team
2671566 im not downplaying this race by any means but i have to put that race behind me
2671567 i have to act like it never happened because i have so many tough races ahead of me
2671568 going into the last 50 and looking to my right and seeing that i was ahead of ryan and laszlo i sort of started smiling
2671569 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2671570 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2671571 we had a deal i told bob that i wanted this to be my last 400 im he said i have to end on a record
2671572 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2671573 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2671574 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2671575 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2671576 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad
2671577 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2671578 it was the third day aug 5 of our trip when i caught the king motor mooching a cut plug herring with only six pulls of line out
2671579 showed me his face and then dove three times before he was able to lift it back up to the surface
2671580 my wife tessa who is a rookie fishermen helped me net the fish
2671581 that fish is the biggest ive ever caught i got really lucky
2671582 weve had at least one 50 pound fish caught almost every day since we opened
2671583 they were getting limits in an hour or two on opening day
2671584 we have at least 2 500 sockeye to fish on and it should last until midweek aug 13 or later well get new numbers tomorrow on what is coming in
2671585 it was pretty good from my perspective and we hooked 10 sockeye and landed four off a shelf on the north shore of the lake in a matter of hours
2671586 the fish were just pouring into the lake and you could look down in four feet of water and there was all kinds of fish moving up into the lake
2671587 there was probably 80 boats in the water and it took us only 15 to 20 minutes to launch our boat but i would expect more of a crowd by the weekend
2671588 the fish arent bright and shiny by any means but the meat is fine and real firm
2671589 weve had some real good fishing and the charters were back at the docks early in the morning on aug 6 7
2671590 most of the chinook were in the high teens up to the mid 20 pound range and the boats were finding them down in the ocean off willapa bay
2671591 there are less and less people turning out for what has been a good year and i think we got some pretty bad press back in the spring when many were led to believe that the whole west coast was closed for salmon
2671592 that is not the truth and we may have enough fish to last through labor day
2671593 the quality of the coho caught are nice getting up to 10 pounds dressed and they look like theyve been weightlifting
2671594 each roof and panel is chosen for its unique character and carefully removed from the unused substructure in such a way as to preserve the original factory finish
2671595 everyone has to learn so that they can one day teach
2671596 we have been pleased at the growing recognition of the quality of wikipedia
2671597 some things get really bad histories politics gets controversial that doesnt get settled easily
2671598 why does spam exist because some people respond to it why are ineffective pharmaceuticals so heavily marketed because some people demand that doctors prescribe them why are so many local stores struggling because so many customers cross the street to the big box stores

2671626 it seems that as soon as we work out a child can see we thrust letters in their face read them books carefully pointing out the words so they know were not making it up and then when they get to school we count down the days to literacy
2671627 i am not an innocent bystander in all this fuss we did everything we could to get child no 1 to read when she was just two now this may sound competely ridiculous but it wasnt at the time we labelled everything in the house using the pretty comic sans font visitors were astonished but soon appreciated the fact that they could easily find the bathroom it was at least three more years before child no 1 made much of the signs

2671675 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province

2671689 thats why infertility is such a quiet issue thats why no one talks about it because its painful and personal
2671690 infertility is indeed a very painful struggle the pain is similar to the grief over losing a loved one but it is unique because it is a recurring grief when a loved one dies he isnt coming back there is no hope that he will come back from the dead you must work through the stages of grief accept that you will never see this person again and move on with your life the grief of infertility is not so cut and dry infertile people grieve the loss of the baby that they may never know they grieve the loss of that baby who would have had mommys nose and daddys eyes but each month there is the hope that maybe that baby will be conceived after all no matter how hard they try to prepare themselves for bad news they still hope that this month will be different then the bad news comes again and the grief washes over the infertile couple anew this process happens month after month year after year it is like having a deep cut that keeps getting opened right when it starts to heal

2671697 this reflects the olympic spirit the ioc believes it is the right decision especially for the athletes as it is a once in a lifetime experience for them
2671698 we were informed last night saturday that discussions were going on
2671699 we had an update this morning sunday but we didnt intervene at any stage

2671738 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense

2671792 war started today in south ossetia when georgia attacked russian peacekeepers in the disputed region apparently putin also said later the defense ministry deployed reinforcements in the region
2671793 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2671794 the absence of our great poet mahmud darwish the love of palestine and the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2671795 darwish is the essential breath of the palestinian people the eloquent witness of exile and belonging

2671799 but im having real trouble seeing a legitimate reason for withholding details of the attack from the transit authority itself
2671800 on the plan ride over i was kind of thumbing through it looking through it just trying to remember it
2671801 one thing we have to get straight is this chad thing
2671802 were going to have to call him rook or call me c p or something
2671803 i dont know he looks a little thin he needs to eat some chicken wings or something
2671804 hes cool though ive played against him so many times he owes me some money though because i get all those personal fouls against him every year so i might take his shoes or something and maybe hell give me a ransom
2671805 its going to be a lot of fun im looking forward to it i really do
2671806 i dont have revenge on my mind or anything like that i have one thing on my mind and thats a victory period
2671807 i think when youre in this business you know that things can happen anytime
2671808 being in it now this being my second year ive seen things happen throughout the season the last year where hey its just the way this business goes its the nfl and you have to be ready to live with whatever happens it went down
2671809 they said over and over again theyre going to do what they have to do to help this team win
2671810 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia
2671811 what to do with all of the great stuff you bought at the farmers market
2671812 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2671813 we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2671814 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2671815 cammino nella mano destra la spada nella sinistra la ragione nel petto il cuore
2671816 i can only imagine the strength of moral fiber necessary to resist the evils of video games on a full time basis herculean feats of endurance matched only by their determination to protect the youth of america from the immoral filth manufactured by developers like rockstar wearied exhausted republicans dripping with sweat having spent the whole day resisting the temptation to fuck kill and profane everyone around them truly they are heroes indeed
2671817 all those years on the couch playing nintendo and playstation appear to be paying off for surgeons

2671820 he hasnt put a foot wrong here hes a world class horse and the cross country course monday will suit him
2671821 she gives the best of herself she was very relaxed
2671822 hes kind of a show off i hoped it would work to his benefit and it did
2671823 im so so excited for the rest of the weekend and that i put up a good score for my country
2671824 making the first tackle of the season its a pretty big deal
2671825 at the same time you have to realize youre only a day away from being cut at any time i mean shaun alexander was the mvp two years ago and then the seahawks cut him in april theres no certainty in this league other than the fact you have to give it your best every day
2671826 you have to really enjoy it because it can be taken away in the blink of an eye its a cutthroat league sometimes it allows you to do a lot of cool things but theres also a lot of pressure and a lot of stress that comes with it its not a glamorous as people think
2671827 yeah its a lot harder to learn these two or three positions than it would be to just focus on one
2671828 if i was with this team for two years and was familiar with the schemes and all that it wouldnt be so tough i study more now than i ever have in my life
2671829 me duele quedar eliminado tan r pido hice todo lo que pude pero mi rival tuvo m s potencia trabaj bien la distancia e hizo un mejor boxeo sencillamente fue mejor que yo
2671830 entrenar tanto durante cuatro a os para s lo competir una vez es muy duro
2671831 jugamos una vez contra ellas y las estudiamos pero hoy hicieron todo lo contrario y tuvimos que modificar nuestra estrategia durante el partido
2671832 al principio estuvimos muy ansiosas y tratamos de hacer demasiadas cosas despu s nos calmamos
2671833 es normal estar nerviosas al principio porque era el primer partido
2671834 youre going to look back just like i do now and man memories are all youve got left and friendship
2671835 farani tavui se encuentra en buenas condiciones est perfectamente consciente se mantendr en observaci n y ser sometido a otros ex menes
2671836 that i said i would retire if we beat the u s team was a joke i just wanted to clarify how difficult it is to win them
2671837 we felt it was the best thing that could happen for us
2671838 not necessarily can we win or how were going to play but to feel the olympic experience and to feel what an opposing crowd might be and the intensity might be
2671839 to have that experience right out of the chute i think is good for us
2671840 estamos absolutamente devastados por lo que ocurri por la p rdida y por todo lo que est n pasando

2671843 beijing es una ciudad segura pero desafortunadamente no somos inmunes a actos de violencia
2671844 the first touchdown felt good because the first team was in there against their first team
2671845 it was crazy my first block out there was zach thomas
2671846 once you do that nothing really worries you anymore once you get out there its football
2671847 we didnt turn it over or have any penalties in the first half thats a good sign that youre not making any silly mistakes in the first preseason game
2671848 ive been definitely able to see progress at training camp and we were able to carry it over from practice to the game
2671849 hopefully by the last preseason game ill be ready and focused to go my timing is messed up right now but ill be alright man
2671850 we didnt play our first group very long offensively and defensively
2671851 that was on purpose one they looked sharp when they were in there two we needed to look at the rest of the guys
2671852 to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self defense

2671872 kandungan gizinya bisa sama dengan makanan segar karena toh makanan kaleng diproses dengan cara tertentu sehingga kandungan gizinya tak hilang
2671873 pada makanan segar pun bisa terjadi penurunan vitamin c vitamin b dan mineral pada saat pencucian dan pembersihan atau penurunan vitamin c dan thiamin akibat pemanasan
2671874 lalu ada lagi pemberian zat zat tertentu supaya makanan menjadi awet yakni ditambah garam natrium agar menarik air atau diberi gula supaya bakteri tertentu tidak bisa hidup pada kekentalan tertentu
2671875 kalau lemak tinggi yang menjadi sebab pada fast food atau makanan cepat saji pun juga demikian
2671876 yang paling penting adalah frekuensi kalau sesekali seminggu dua kali selama seseorang tidak mempunyai penyakit tertentu seperti darah tinggi yang harus menghindari garam tinggi saya pikir tidak masalah
2671877 tentu saja masalah halal atau tidaknya itu menjadi prioritas terutama untuk sebagian besar masyarakat kita yang beragama islam lalu keutuhan kaleng artinya tidak penyok tidak berlubang meski hanya kecil tanggal kedaluwarsa serta kandungan isinya
2671878 karena biasanya dimakan bersama susu ini baik untuk sarapan te tapi akan lebih baik lagi jika sarapan itu dilengkapi dengan sayur dan buah buahan
2671879 itu sebabnya kalau kita makan di restoran restoran besar selalu disediakan buah buahan untuk sarapan pagi
2671880 apalagi biasa nya ada telur serta ikan ini me rupakan diet seimbang
2671881 jangan abaikan makan pagi ini terutama untuk anak anak yang masih dalam masa pertumbuhan
2671882 makanya jika anak tidak sarapan dia biasanya akan merasa lemas atau lesu sebelum tengah hari karena gula darah dalam tubuhnya sudah menurun
2671883 makanan dalam kaleng menurut saya masih merupakan kebutuhan insidentil belum menjadi pola yang memasyarakat
2671884 apalagi dari sisi harga makanan dalam kaleng itu relatif mahal
2671885 apa yang terjadi di negara negara barat toh mereka akhirnya ramai ramai mengumandangkan back to nature termasuk di sini dalam soal makanan
2671886 saya yakin bumbu bumbu instan ini lebih banyak diminati daripada lauk pauk dalam kaleng selain pertimbangan rasa pertimbangan ekonomi juga menjadi sangat penting berapa banyak sih masyarakat kita yang mampu membeli lauk dalam kaleng untuk makanan sehari hari
2671887 aromanya tidak bisa menandingi bumbu buatan sendiri dan lagi standar resepnya beda dan belum tentu cocok dengan selera
2671888 buat sekaligus agak banyak sehingga bisa untuk beberapa kali masak
2671889 tumis bumbu bumbu itu sebelum dibekukan dengan ditumis kemungkinan terjadinya kontaminasi bisa dihindari

2671937 buying the uptown is one thing rehabbing it is another
2671938 this will have to be a partnership between the city the state and ourselves
2671939 no private entity could afford to put that amount of money into a theater
2671940 the uptown can only reopen with the necessary funding from the city
2671941 we would first want to see a solid redevelopment plan
2671942 just because the theater is located away from downtown doesnt mean it doesnt deserve the same kind of funding as the loop theaters
2671943 this is a theater that will serve the entire metropolitan area
2671944 a lot of people will be looking over the new owners shoulders

2671961 desi mallu masala movies are very popular in south india desi masala mallu movies are seriously
2671962 we tried to look for ideas in every choice that we make in our homes hoping that everyone who goes through it will be inspired to make some change on some level
2671963 some people will walk away and want to do an entire new home or some people will think when they go for their towels next and go for organic linens
2671964 it is happening but the industry needs to do a better job of getting information into peoples hands when theyre looking for it
2671965 i like not making a negative impact on the earth
2671966 its got so much to be said for it because it uses nature and natural materials
2671967 its open you bring the outside in and you can even bring the inside out its a house built for humans its plausible in real life
2671968 the impression that green building has to be modern weird solar ugly
2671969 one of the things thats fundamental to green building is that it can look like anything it can be a regular craftsman house or a cape cod house in new england or an adobe house in santa fe you dont have to change what the home looks like to make it green
2671970 but we hope people will make informed decisions when theyre building when theyre renovating

2671975 with fewer new condos being built there will be a drought at some point
2671976 the biggest selection is now and in the next six months to a year once those units are sold the builders will wait until the economy gets better to build again
2671977 the big guys like horton centex and lennar closed the doors to new projects by early 2007 and most got out alive
2671978 they finished up phases of projects but have not been willing to go forward with future projects
2671979 related cos hasnt been able to assemble the financing so theyre uncommitted as to when theyll start now
2671980 if you go to north hollywood there were 20 condominium projects for sale last year and most sold if they didnt the developer sold some units and held the rest for rentals
2671981 we went to 15 to 20 open houses looking at places and used it as a way to choose our realtor
2671982 in general i think there are some good deals out there now but there are still some that are overpriced
2671983 even though the market has dropped off dramatically there are sales taking place in high end pockets
2671984 were almost 40 pre sold in the project before its finished
2671985 the bigger problem for us is getting qualified buyers to requalify under current lending requirements
2671986 no new project has started in our county in the last two years
2671987 weve seen 12 builders and developers in san diego county consolidate with their orange county or riverside county operations or close their offices
2671988 we had projects in the pipeline for irvine palm desert pasadena and anaheim and are continuing forward with them but have shifted them to rental instead of being for sale properties

2672002 its a whole different world i never would have realized it until you get into it get more ingrained in how different it is
2672003 a division i school has a choice in what it believes in and were going to make this choice
2672004 we cant go to our same ticket base or annual fund base and expect to get another 160 000 out of the same people
2672005 so what we do is attack it on the endowment side
2672006 you cant control how much money donors are going to give you
2672007 but you can control how much relationship building and how many specific proposals you make each month
2672008 we asked our coaches to schedule the toughest schedule they could possibly get
2672009 to me recruiting is still the most important thing we do at this level
2672010 but now that were division i scheduling is not that far behind
2672011 but then again who knows when we played kentucky and illinois who knows what impression that made on eighth graders and freshmen in high school in our region thats the immeasurable
2672012 recruiting starts in brookings then brookings county then south dakota then the region and maybe nationally most programs in the country understand that you have to have the local best coming to your university
2672013 our main problem in the state is just trying to keep the very very best players at home
2672014 that didnt used to be so difficult but with aau and stuff its harder
2672015 early on we were na ve enough to think we could just really present our case and it would be so compelling that they would take us
2672016 but the bottom line is the conference is always going to have a plan for what fits the current membership and their needs
2672017 tom was able to sit in a position that he knew a lot about our schools
2672018 he had seen our schools in action in football he had been on our campuses he know the scope of our academic programs he knew that we might fit well we were in the right position
2672019 last season will continue to loom large over us until we win a game people wont forget it until that happens
2672020 i think it is fair to say we looked like a team with seven new signings as a team i think doncaster were more comfortable playing with each other
2672021 i am aware that we need to gel pretty quickly there are games a lot of games that we can win this season not like last season when the feeling was we were going to be beaten
2672022 i would call it a good start after 10 games not after 90 minutes
2672023 we made a poor start last season so we wanted to get a first win under our belts as quickly as possible
2672024 i thought that marcus tudgay was excellent and akpo sodje showed just what a player he can be for us
2672025 wednesday didnt have to work hard because they were soft goals
2672026 we took the game to wednesday in the second half but it was too big an obstacle to overcome
2672027 como apunte charlize theron sale guap sima en esta pel cula es su mejor pel cula en cuanto a lucimiento f sico impresionante
2672028 i really am bothered that only three out of a city this big qualified
2672029 i looked at it and i didnt see any fire truck around
2672030 it made me wonder if they had a truck i dont think the whole city would have burned

2672038 this is the biggest change mandated from the state in my memory
2672039 we believe its going to cost more than the allocation from the state
2672040 we had to cut down a number of our costs
2672041 theres a new demographic in the west more latte and less lasso
2672042 i think well win in a lot of places that people dont expect us to and we hope arizona is one of them
2672043 senator mccain has always overwhelmingly earned the votes of arizonans but we wont take anything for granted
2672044 when you have races decided by less than 1 percent its very difficult for campaigns to decide what issue worked in the past or didnt
2672045 the effort here will be to get out that vote
2672046 the race has yet to be run and mccain is in it
2672047 theres going to be democrats everywhere celebrating and that creates a bubbling atmosphere that can energize and excite people
2672048 that may push obama up 1 2 3 percent of the vote and in a close state that can make a difference
2672049 and when you start to compare it to national concerns such as the economy health care war yucca doesnt trump those

2672060 she was 10 or 15 feet away and she was smiling and laughing and saying daddy
2672061 then she was just gone it looked like she had been shot
2672062 that was i dont know why the saddest day of my life
2672063 its not like we were working at jack in the box

2672070 with nuclear proliferation posing a greater threat along with weapons of mass destruction our unilateral policy of no first use necessitates that india possesses a credible and survivable nuclear deterrent including submarine launched

2672113 that one might argue that they constitute little more than outdoor zoo populations
2672114 cannot be expected to expend funds indefinitely to maintain condors in nature
2672115 progress toward recovery is not sustainable under current conditions because reintroduction of more condors simply increases the costs required to keep wild birds alive
2672116 an extensive outreach effort to rally support for replacement of lead ammunition
2672117 poisoning from ingestion of spent ammunition in carcasses is so severe and chronic
2672118 that condor recovery cannot be achieved so long as such lead exposure continues
2672119 removing lead ammunition is not only right for condors it is right for other scavengers and it is right for hunters and their families
2672120 may be highly problematic california fish and game has done little to educate hunters and nonlead ammunition is not readily available or identifiable in many retail outlets
2672121 unlikely to comply as long as lead bullets are easily purchased

2672160 a democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government it can only exist until a majority of voters discover that they can vote themselves largess out of the public treasury

2672164 the x rays we took prior to her waking showed damage in the area of her brain we were all happy that she did in fact wake up but we needed to confirm that she was ok we did more x rays and found no lingering problems the damage we documented while she was still comatose was no longer evident
2672165 that wedding must not take place tomorrow and if it does you will not exist

2672167 most frogs produce skin toxins but the dart poison frogs from central and south america are the most potent of all the golden poison frog called terribilis the terrible is so toxic that even touching it can be dangerous a single terribilis contains enough poison to kill 20 000 mice or 10 people it is probably the most poisonous animal on earth

2672174 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2672175 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2672176 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2672177 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2672178 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her

2672181 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2672182 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2672183 my views developed in the course of time but i have always believed in what i did and never acted against it
2672184 the soviet government had let the genie out of the bottle and however hard they tried later they couldnt put it back in
2672185 russia can neither be grasped by the mind nor measured by any common yardstick no attitude to her other than one of blind faith is admissible
2672186 broke russias back the red terror unleashed by its leaders their willingness to drown russia in blood is the first and foremost proof of it
2672187 the bitter russian experience which i have been studying and describing all my life will be for us a lesson that keeps us from new disastrous breakdowns
2672188 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2672189 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2672190 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2672191 theyll remain deadlocked and each side will use it to become more deeply entrenched in their positions

2672193 i think theres a great denial among young people in this country with regard to melanoma
2672194 the concept had been on the table for some years now all countries have finally agreed on the formation and implementation of the saarc food bank
2672195 properly realised it would serve as a milestone in strengthening the existing cooperation among the nations of south asia
2672196 this involves the construction of new food warehouses in member countries local procurement and the international purchase of extra food grains and developing an administrative system and a distribution network so it is likely that it will take some time before operationalising the saarc food bank
2672197 a person working in the bank reported it we have several teams looking for her we have to be certain

2672212 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2672213 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2672214 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2672215 i was expecting if you like a more conventional correction that followed the patterns of a straightforward downturn this has clearly been far more than that weve seen massive disruptions of the financial markets particularly liquidity problems which were not anticipated
2672216 possibility of real economic downturn continued difficulties in credit markets
2672217 at the moment i do not see anyone who can give anwar a run for his money
2672218 no way i have resigned in 2003 and i have said that im not coming back
2672219 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2672220 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2672221 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2672222 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2672227 with a young guy like that with his talent its a pleasure to see him go out and play hard every day hes very tough he wont shy away from any kind of contact and he hustles all the time just watching him makes everybody else raise their game
2672228 we know what he can do from last year and we just want him to come out and continue where he left off
2672229 hes a playmaker and thats what you want on defense youre going to have your solid guys but you need guys who can step up and make plays
2672230 the thing with david is that he anticipates a lot
2672231 i learned a long time ago that if you can anticipate where things are going youre a step ahead he understands his read responsibilities and before the play is run hes almost there already
2672232 it probably means more playing time for me especially if anything else happens
2672233 it puts more pressure on me because mentally i have to really push myself to get this stuff down before the preseason is over with
2672234 i have to get all the communication we need down pat as far as making line and secondary adjustments im in charge of all that
2672235 ive been a jets fan for over 40 years and this to me is the biggest thing theyve ever done im a big chad pennington fan but you cant argue with this
2672236 people are coming in buying multiples of jerseys the demand is unprecedented the tent opened up on friday at 11 a m and we had the first fan waiting here at 7 oclock its like a feeding frenzy of favre
2672237 you cant help but get excited on a scale of 1 to 10 id have to give this deal about a 12 im thinking super bowl well have two losses at the most this season
2672238 hes always been my favorite player and id much rather he be here than with any other nfc team so im ok with this
2672239 i went to lambeau and saw his last regular season game and i thought that was it when he retired but im glad hes still playing and hes in new york so i can get to watch all his games
2672240 im pretty happy but im going to wait until he does something to get all excited
2672241 were going to go 1 1 against new england in the regular season and then beat them in the second round of the playoffs 17 14
2672242 im not surprised by the response from the fans its great
2672243 theres been a lot of ups and downs not only the last week but the last couple of months i think everyone was kind of ready to just get on to football i was overly excited as i started practicing im going to pay for it tomorrow i feel rough
2672244 i would watch brett all the time on tv when i was growing up i never thought id be playing on the same team with him
2672245 there had been speculations all off season im one of those guys i believe it when i see it now i believe it
2672246 my transition here how are the guys very basic questions
2672247 if this was a movie script how would this end
2672248 is that like a trick question or a prediction or something
2672249 id be foolish to think opening day i would know this offense like ive known the offense that ive been in in the past
2672250 ive always felt like in any offense or defense throughout the nfl theres way too much volume the coaches have way too much free time
2672251 i guess when i figure that out ill tell you
2672252 right now ive been here a few days theres nothing more for me to do but try to get this offense down get acclimated to the guys and the system that will take a while and that will be tough
2672253 the opening game of the national football league season is four weeks away and today new york football fans have the number 4 on their minds for another reason and thats because the legendary 4 brett favre has now become jets favre
2672254 it has four dollars worth of fare on it it seems like just the right amount if you had picked a number higher we would have gotten more money on your metro card
2672255 the bottom line as we all know is to win games
2672256 i looked over at mike and said the pressure is just building the attention ive got since ive been here has been overwhelming
2672257 i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i will give the new york jets and the people here in the city the best year possible
2672258 my job is to play football and be a leader for these guys its that simple
2672259 there is no other reason for me to be up here
2672260 it takes chemistry and to me thats the most important thing
2672261 you can have all the talent in the world and if the chemistrys not there it wont matter i think we can achieve that
2672262 we want to keep you focused so here is your key ring
2672263 you will notice it does not have a key on it but you win the super bowl and i promise you that you will get a key to go on your transit authority key ring
2672264 i talked last week about how he popped off the screen he had a nice day
2672265 they threw the ball over our heads twice for two big plays and that will kill you
2672266 i think i do and i hope i can bring something to the team
2672267 i was really happy with david clowney he had a nice day
2672268 there are two ways to look at it your glass is either half full or its half empty
2672269 im going to approach this like its a great opportunity for me well see how things play out in the long term but you dont get that many opportunities to learn from a guy like brett favre
2672270 what were doing now is what we do in any case like this is to take every precaution
2672271 you have to dive into it the only way youre going to know these guys know how they play and know the coaches is to be in meetings and is to go to practice
2672272 why did you do that thats not what we talked about
2672273 well ok when you stop knowing then well do it the other way
2672274 what organization gives me the best opportunity to be a professional and to succeed
2672275 the advertising industry can no longer clutch to the excuse of uncertainty or fear the time has come to allocate a significant portion of advertising dollars spent to reach consumers in the online environment

2672279 it wasnt the canadian heart that was torn it was the canadian psyche that was ripped by an uppercut to the paranoia
2672280 must participate in that event if they participate at the olympic games
2672281 we want basic skills basic knowledge of what it takes to succeed
2672282 it brings all those things to a much more conscious level
2672283 once you understand that your situation at work really can change

2672285 i pretty much instantly fell in love with the town
2672286 i didnt see one ugly yard or neighborhood everything was beautiful the campus was amazing and the coaches were awesome i felt really welcome there
2672287 but over the years theyve come a long way and now theyre one of the better teams in their conference theyve recruited a lot of new players this year
2672288 signing trevor was a big pickup for us because we were trying to fill the third base spot that we had open
2672289 trevor has good size he looks like a normal third baseman and a typical baseball player he came in did a workout for us and we liked what we saw we were able to make him an offer that worked out for both of us
2672290 the fallon baseball program is very excited that trevor is going to play at sioux falls
2672291 were very sure he will do well at the next level
2672292 i told him that i wanted to go to that style of defense and asked him if he knew of any young guys that could put in his scheme
2672293 it was the right time to do it woody widenhofer had decided to retire
2672294 the defense puts players in a lot of different positions byu and new mexico run it dont know anybody in the wac that does
2672295 the 3 4 was more of a read and react defense were a little thinner a little smaller and probably faster
2672296 everybody is going to be running to the ball no matter what
2672297 we dont have to worry as much getting beat deep well give the underneath ball all day
2672298 he has put up terrific numbers and put forth a heroic effort last season its his last shot his best shot
2672299 wes neiman performed very well both he and kyle got some great experience
2672300 kyle smith patrick blount and joel buschman all had good springs
2672301 for one day my work isnt in vain im going to live with this as long as i can
2672302 then we go back downstairs there are 1 500 like her but to have this end in this happy way is just always gratifying tomorrow it will be the rimer kids the next group
2672303 it made me realize how many kids are out there and how hard we work for one child
2672304 theres hundreds more theres thousands more although i was happy and excited and felt relieved i also felt like wow weve got a lot of work to do

2672306 if peter were married to paula there would be no tax consequences
2672307 with peter married to paul you have a capital gains tax and the capital gains tax is 15 percent
2672308 the biggest surprise about the whole thing is that there really has been no surprise
2672309 he was certainly a hero of mine and i think that he was always a fair and open minded person
2672310 i am confident that at some point in the not too distant future gay marriage will become the reality across the country
2672311 when early 20th century progressives designed californias ballot initiative process they envisioned that it would act as a safety valve enabling citizens to supplement the work of the legislature when it failed or refused to act
2672312 todays initiative process however has outstripped this vision an emerging culture of democracy by initiative is transforming the electorate into a fourth and new branch of government
2672313 she is a good and honest person the sweetest and most caring woman one could ever hope to meet
2672314 do you think its easy for us to just sit back and let everyone rip her to shreds and not defend her honor
2672315 she wishes to maintain her privacy and her daughters privacy
2672316 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2672317 was extremely useful for making the case that the cpsc really is exporting banned and recalled products to less suspecting countries
2672318 an ethical country that believes children should be protected should not at the same time ship unsafe products to other countries
2672319 be communicating with parents consumer advocates and industry on how the law will be implemented and how consumer products will be made safer
2672320 our agency through our governing statutes cannot claim much moral superiority over the chinese or any other foreign country when it comes to our own export policy
2672321 why would we take something off the shelves here only to ship it off to another country and put other children at risk that makes no sense
2672322 i think the gamesmanship frankly is immature it is not the type of decorum that i like to have on the floor i think it reflects that we are not doing business in the manner that we should
2672323 im glad that schwarzenegger stepped up to this but lets be clear he doesnt have any support in his own party yet for this tax increase and unless he can get republicans to agree with his point of view we could be here for an extended period of time
2672324 i can only conclude that the lack of negotiations stem from the democrats unwillingness to talk about any solutions that do not include a tax increase we can balance this budget without tax increases and it is imperative that we do so now
2672325 there is a strategic focus on sending messages to high level officials within the government
2672326 i live because god is great i dont know how else to explain it
2672327 i work in a restaurant i cant take off a whole shift to go sit in a caucus we need to all be on the same primary system
2672328 why should 2 000 people in iowa have the same say as 2 million in pennsylvania
2672329 caucuses inherently disenfranchise the elderly disabled shift workers single parents and others whose circumstance prohibits participation in caucuses

2672358 in response to mr biazons question why american government is sending the aircraft carrier uss ronald reagan hmm well he should know better he was a former military correct
2672359 in the 80s and early 90s the vietnam war vet was the other
2672360 it is the self licking ice cream cone of hollywood they make a war movie based on another war movie
2672361 its important to tell the full story not a story based on a weird vietnam era idea of what the military is like
2672362 in the past have there been instances of disagreements with scripts yes
2672363 the message i would send is give us a try
2672364 they are trying to put the best spin on what they are doing
2672365 of course they want to publicize what is good but it doesnt mean that it is true
2672366 this is what southern california looked like 100 years ago
2672367 there have been so many changes to this area but this place has stayed the same
2672368 a gravel mine of this magnitude is a massive change to the ecosystem
2672369 this is the only linkage between the coast and the mountains and you would suddenly have a 1 000 foot quarry in the middle of it
2672370 we dont have enough properties like this in the world to sacrifice for this kind of thing
2672371 nobody in their right mind wants a rock quarry in their backyard
2672372 there is no benefit to us facts dont matter statistics dont matter go to any of these houses and ask them and theyll tell you nobody wants a rock quarry in their town
2672373 we need the business we need the jobs and thats a positive especially when you have a company that wants to work with you
2672374 i am hopeful that all the other issues can be mitigated
2672375 if people keep saying no no no to everything what are we going to do when we need new parks and schools
2672376 i think a lot of people tried them because they felt sorry for us
2672377 i looked up to people in tobacco never have i thought that no i dont need to get involved in tobacco
2672378 one could argue what kind of example am i setting why am i smoking i need to consider that
2672379 there wont be zero coca but there wont be free cultivation of coca either
2672380 the u s required growers to quit planting coca before they could access alternative development programs without considering that their families needed to eat now the cato guarantees the farmers income giving them the chance to take risks with new crops
2672381 the total area used for coca is unlikely to be reduced significantly given market prices
2672382 before we rejected alternative development because it was an excuse for u s interference
2672383 in august well start burning the hills to prepare the earth and in october and november well be planting
2672384 as someone who has been working in the travel industry since 1981 ive never even after 9 11 seen conditions this severe
2672385 the scarlett ohara fiddle dee dee ill think about this tomorrow mentality wont work
2672386 i think its more difficult for people that are young
2672387 theyre trying to raise a family they have huge mortgages
2672388 i can see them having trouble going to the grocery store
2672389 more important this year than even years past to book as early as you can
2672390 you have to be aware that not all of the cuts have come into play yet
2672391 if you look at the traffic jams in nairobi you have no option but to walk
2672392 if we dont do anything to decongest nairobi soon i have no doubt it will come to a standstill in a decade
2672393 when you are stuck in a jam you feel a headache you feel disheartened and agitated
2672394 you want to flout all the rules just to beat the traffic
2672395 the only way we can stop sea level rise is if people believe we can
2672396 when i first met carl i thought he was a philosopher

2672401 ugly sump surrounded by a bathtub ring of sterile white alkali encrustments
2672402 the demand for wind technicians is such that some colleges have been trying to keep companies away from the program because they want everybody to graduate first
2672403 in some cases students are being picked up after only a couple of months
2672404 youre looking at several hundred jobs in just one year
2672405 the natural question was is there anybody doing any training
2672406 its a fairly rigorous program and there are some students who dont make it through
2672407 the job outlook in the wind industry is virtually unlimited
2672408 you never know what you may have to deal with
2672409 when you are 300 feet in the air it is not always easy to get a hand from another person
2672410 employers are coming to us saying we want to hire 50 people this summer
2672411 its definitely a big challenge for the industry right now
2672412 typically were a bit more flexible in bringing on a new program
2672413 theres perhaps less bureaucracy community colleges are known for responding to current needs in their community or current opportunities in their communities if theres a need out there theyre probably going to be the first to recognize it
2672414 were one of the leading states for wind development we ought to have a wind tower technician training program here
2672415 these are good paying jobs with a lot of upside potential
2672416 it is in our best interest to make sure that when those students leave that program they are as well trained as they can possibly be
2672417 it could be the largest fish in the world and we know next to nothing about it
2672418 ive spent five years on the mekong looking for rays and only saw two or three they were nowhere near the size id heard about
2672419 of the two dozen or so species of giant fish about 70 percent are threatened with extinction
2672420 is it truly a freshwater species where does it breed what are its migratory patterns
2672421 when you see them in the flesh it is quite humbling
2672422 why do i keep seeing a 3 07 on the scoreboard
2672423 thats probably your 300 meter split at the olympics in the 400 im
2672424 i guess you can say i went out too fast
2672425 we still need to push very hard in the development of the car and the reliability but even in a worse case like this were still in the championship completely
2672426 were still in the fight well be pushing very hard over the break
2672427 we are very sad for felipe because he did in my view the best race of his career today
2672428 it was fantastic in the way he attacked and the way he managed the race so we are very disappointed for that
2672429 i think im still growing a lot and learning race to race and that can help for the championship the confidence and thats the most important thing
2672430 i think for the moment everything is completely open we have three cars in a very small gap in terms of points
2672431 we got the impression he didnt want to extend the lease
2672432 its a real pain you have to shove the boat down an embankment
2672433 its particularly tough for people who arent as savvy with boats and trailers
2672434 its a pretty difficult offense to learn and im sure the one ive been in the last 16 years has been difficult too itll take some time but i think well be fine
2672435 somethings not working somethings not right something has to change thats the bottom line
2672436 becoming a suitable engraving for a tombstone should this season end dead with no playoffs
2672437 ive been on a team thats been in first place and fired their coach things happen
2672438 ive seen great players have bad seasons and go thats the nature of the beast right now weve got to do something whether its formation personnel whatever
2672439 they dont give possible wins at the end of the year they give wins and losses
2672440 its something different out of the ordinary and obviously a chance for these people to be on tv and win some big bucks
2672441 and these people are used to running in front of a couple hundred people not thousands of people
2672442 i dont hire a maid but my kids are grown so i spend my time having as much fun as i can
2672443 i travel all over the country dragging my wife and three kids around to these races
2672444 i come up the road from colorado springs and finally make the field
2672445 of course it shakes you up were in a foreign place when something like this happens it kind of makes you take a step back
2672446 were all here representing our country if anything happens to any one of us then were all touched by it were definitely going to be a lot more cautious were all hoping it was an isolated incident of violence and nothing bigger or something that was directed at us
2672447 we feel pretty good about where hes at hopefully with no setback
2672448 but you learn from it i will be watching film tomorrow
2672449 i need to work on being a little more aggressive on the run
2672450 its just hard when you lose by three though i feel kind of bad about that ive got to go back and figure out what happened and come back next week and be better
2672451 its early still ive still got to be kind of patient
2672452 they came to everything they were like little usa nomads
2672453 they were some of the biggest fans weve ever had
2672454 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2672455 ive talked to three or four families already they didnt voice any concerns to me but that doesnt mean they dont have them
2672456 but i think the chinese are saying that its an isolated incident and you just have to feel that its an isolated incident
2672457 there is a different competition level on the field its much higher than in the dominican plus a lot of these kids are going away from home for the first time
2672458 the pressure on some of these kids from back home is tremendous
2672459 a lot of these kids are the only providers for their families for the majority of the cases they represent their families only hope when you have that pressure already it can eat you up
2672460 i tell them to learn as much as they can when they are not on the baseball field to enhance their cultural experience
2672461 i think if they are comfortable in their surroundings they will play better on the field i want them to know there is life outside baseball i dont want them sulking and thinking that a 0 for 4 night with three punchouts is the end of the world
2672462 its kind of neat to see all the guys whove come through here
2672463 he traveled a lot and it was comforting to know that other people were taking care of him its important to have a place to call home
2672464 when everth left he cried and hugged me and told me he loved our family
2672465 so i guess we really did help him out he still calls me
2672466 his english is much improved and hes more outgoing hes been my biggest project and its so gratifying to see him taking off in some ways he reminds me of ubaldo
2672467 i was like wow there are a lot of blonde people a lot of blonde girls
2672468 and everybody was white and everything was about rodeos and cows and horses it was so different
2672469 the others are playing like they are starting and i have to come back and win my job back
2672470 i dont know if id put myself in a category with those guys
2672471 its fairly common for a linebacker who gets a little too heavy to move down to end its a natural progression
2672472 i have to keep eating through camp so i dont lose any weight
2672473 my academic adviser helped me quite a bit keeping me on schedule
2672474 i love it he brings speed from linebackers position to defensive end he already knows the defense hes going to be real good
2672475 hes got good quickness great pass dropping back skills just a natural defensive end
2672476 the no 1 thing that impressed me about tommie is natural ability
2672477 the goal was never to lose more than i won and it worked out quite well that way
2672478 youre playing against yourself you dont have a teammate you dont have a partner and its the most challenging game there is its you and the golf course and you dont get help its competitive its difficult and i just love it
2672479 business always came first but i managed it so i could play golf as much as i wanted to back when i was really playing for money id play six days a week and i ran the golf just like it was a business there was real money involved and i kept a golf account i kept records id send my caddie out to a town days before i arrived to scout the other players the goal was never to lose more than i won and it worked out quite well that way
2672480 the biggest thing in playing for money is having confidence and believing you can win i really enjoyed playing a guy who was better than me it motivated me i won 90 percent of all my matches and i was never as good as most of those opponents if you looked at talent or the swing but determination is a big deal to me and i believe in it and i found a way to win if there was a 25 foot putt i had to make with all the money on the line i found a way to talk myself into making it
2672481 i sponsored tom woodard on the pga tour in 1980
2672482 one day he came up to me and said im ready to be sponsored i was shocked but hed done everything id asked him to do
2672483 i was never good enough to play on the tour i was good enough to play on the road for money against good players but i never was at the level that tommy played at he just had more talent than i had i just had more of a game that could go out and play someone one on one i enjoyed that the pressure inspired me i always played above my head like that but to go out and play stroke play against the best players in the world i was never there
2672484 i had guys who played for me and if the games were for a group id take them on the road with me for months and months and months and we never lost
2672485 local golf businessman stacey hart was a great player for me back then he was just a kid and id tell people hell beat you playing from his knees well he could hit it 250 yards from his knees he could shoot a 73 from his knees everybody would jump on that bet after we won that game id have him play with one club a 5 iron he could shoot 75 with one club i never lost a match with him once we were playing for 30 000 and were four holes down with five to play and he shot 5 under for the win he was like the tiger woods of his day
2672486 at one point a friend of mine and i had to put hitches in our swings in order to get games out on the road unfortunately when i wanted to get rid of it i couldnt
2672487 i want to be careful about this ive played many many rounds with john elway ive played a lot with joe morgan from the cincinnati reds there have been a lot of other guys who you may not know but who think theyre really really good thats to my advantage the thing that i had going is that i was always underestimated my swing is unorthodox so nobody ever thought i would win and thats exactly what you want those guys are winners just awesome winners john doesnt like talking about the gambling part but ive won a lot of our matches
2672488 five or six years ago city park was the no 1 place to go to find a money game you could come any time and youd find a game now you have to kind of know where they are but a lot of the game shave dried up i think the economy played a part in that but a lot of the players have also moved on theyve moved away or things have changed for them now you might find a 100 nassau in the old days youd be playing for 5 000 10 000 whatever the number was you can still get that game in california but you dont see it much here anymore
2672489 after we finished he said weve gotta go to the big house to get your money that was his boss who lived in a mansion out in the woods
2672490 well we were a little bit nervous about going out there at night but there was this palace sitting up on a hill down there they never call you by your real name they called me little man so when we went in the boss said little man you beat up on my guy pretty good when you play tomorrow you have to give him strokes i didnt like that game at all i had to fake a back injury the next day because there was no way i could give him two strokes a side playing for that kind of money
2672491 in the game of golf word gets out fast when youre a cheater all over the united states there are guys who play for money and we pretty much know each other and if you get caught cheating youre out period there are guys who grease their clubs to make the ball go straight and farther or drop balls weve had it all but you only need to know it once when youre caught youre finished
2672492 jonathan kaye brought a buddy over here once wanting a money game i told a friend of mine were gonna play these kids to teach them a lesson but we wont take their money they were just kids we got to beating them up and they were shocked they lost quite a bit of money
2672493 we get into the clubhouse and they had 5 each im pretending to be upset going wheres my money theyre saying they would go get it and im going go where give me my money
2672494 they were getting nervous but i wanted to teach them the lesson that you never play for money when you dont have yours to pay i made them promise that theyd never do it again
2672495 that was a big problem when youd do that out on the road
2672496 well i really thought the guy he was playing against didnt have it and i told him if he didnt he shouldnt be playing but he lost and he didnt have it the winner was really mad but rather than getting into some real trouble he made the loser undress out in the parking lot and he took his clothes he humiliated him
2672497 they came to everything they were like little usa nomads
2672498 they were some of the biggest fans weve ever had
2672499 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2672500 as a team there is nothing more important to us than supporting mrs bachman in her struggle and supporting hugh and elisabeth in their grief we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2672501 we extend our sincere condolences to the victims and their families there was no reason the attack was targeted on americans
2672502 ive talked to three or four families already they didnt voice any concerns to me but that doesnt mean they dont have them
2672503 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2672504 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2672505 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2672506 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it
2672507 i definitely respect those animals theyre awesome animals and i love them
2672508 but they are more dangerous than a car theyll get you if you let them
2672509 this is something ive been looking forward to for a while a real special thing for me
2672510 when i was 7 my mom thought it would be fun for me to try and ride a steer at the county fair and now here i am 15 years later
2672511 its only eight seconds so most people think you just have to hang on but theres a lot of balance and countermoves we practice and weve practiced them our whole lives
2672512 you can never just hang on because the bull is going to out power you and throw you off its really just counteracting you have a split second to counteract the jump of a bull its a give and take its kind of like a dance you have to get in motion with them
2672513 its a pretty difficult offense to learn and im sure the one ive been in the last 16 years has been difficult too itll take some time but i think well be fine
2672514 that seems like so long ago it seems like a dream
2672515 im not going to sit here and tell you that ive got this offense down that i know every guy in the locker room or they know me
2672516 its a routine and im just kind of following them thats different for me
2672517 i was really surprised that today i was as effective as i was and im not saying that that was good
2672518 im just saying i was able to take a snap call a play we were able to break a huddle and i was able to complete passes in some sort of rhythm
2672519 all the rumors about him throwing hard yeah theyre true
2672520 as soon as we stepped out here the stands are filled and it creates a new energy for the team
2672521 i came here as a kid and there were always a few people here and there but nothing like this
2672522 anytime you have a chance to get a guy like brett favre youve got to go get him
2672523 now with him theyre going to go at least 10 6
2672524 of course i and this team would come out being victorious
2672525 i hope at the end of this season i really do that i feel like i made the right decision i hope the jets fans and the people throughout the nfl world feel like i made the right decision
2672526 how do you tell brett favre to adapt to you
2672527 hes trying to learn everybodys name trying to figure out where the cafeteria is and the dorm rooms and all that other stuff
2672528 theres nothing for me to do than try to get this offense down get acclimated with the guys the system and that will take awhile and thatll be tough
2672529 im two weeks behind as far as practice and im also 38 years old so im a little bit behind there too
2672530 my arm feels fine itll be tired tomorrow and itll be sore because theres no substitute for getting into game type situations and putting the pads on
2672531 weve been kind of joking around with thunder and lightning
2672532 nates a little more finesse im a little more brute
2672533 comes into the office every day with a smile on his face
2672534 i hope its three years in this day and age you never know
2672535 the thing thats most impressive to me at this point is how hard they worked this summer
2672536 not only have they done everything we want physically but also everything we want in terms of their work ethic and their leadership if we had 100 guys on the team like them wed be unstoppable
2672537 its really great to have a bond with the other tackle
2672538 in the run game ive been able to help him out in pass blocking hes helped me tremendously when we watch film nate is so balanced and straight back when he takes his first couple of steps
2672539 all my game experience has been at tight end and hes always played offensive tackle so i can learn the mentality it takes it motivates you seeing a guy as high caliber as him on the field
2672540 that reach of theirs is really hard to get past
2672541 you just get out of your stance and theyre already on you
2672542 we arent going to sacrifice what he does from a contribution standpoint playing corner
2672543 were going to make sure he has that down pat before we get too elaborate with anything were going to do offensively with him
2672544 as a junior and senior i practiced offense every day but the coaches never let me play it for some reason
2672545 if it gets complicated at any time its done it wont happen
2672546 hes got to be a bright kid a versatile kid but yet at the same time how many of these guys have been growing up since they were 6 years old playing football with their dad in the backyard so with him it might be a case where you dont make football too sophisticated
2672547 coach calhoun knows what hes doing if he brings you over to play offense you know its in the best interest of the team he said if i can learn the system we will try it out and so far im still here
2672548 its not too hard we play a lot of man coverage i know it pretty good so now i can focus on the offensive package
2672549 more so because he was the best at what he does and i try to be the best i can be at whatever i do

2672551 i wanted to sing on the medal podium but i couldnt stop crying
2672552 every time i started thinking about everything that happened this year the ups and downs ive had ryans coming on like a freight train i was happy to get the first one under my belt
2672553 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 after seeing everyone so close together
2672554 usually thats not how it is after the first 200 its after the first 300 but i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2672555 i knew i had to go out a lot faster in that race i did my best i cant ask for anything else
2672556 i talked to him after the race and he said well have to talk
2672557 you watch a team play and say why were they 5 6
2672558 you go back and see they lost two in ot they had a key player get hurt always look for a team that lost games they could have won
2672559 if west virginia beat us by four touchdowns no one is even talking about us
2672560 by the time the jayhawks got to the end they had so much confidence they won because of outstanding coaching and confidence
2672561 the bigger the event is the less traffic in my store
2672562 going to go down and buy a dress or shoes or surfboards when its a mob scene

2672567 im in shock and not prepared to speak to those girls about this yet what could i possibly say
2672568 i just cant imagine whats going through her mind right now
2672569 wiz has always been a dedicated athlete and teammate team has always come first to wiz just like family and that is because of the qualities instilled in her by todd and barbara
2672570 wiz worked tremendously hard as an athlete to pursue and live her dream of being an olympian always with the support of her parents her character driven lifestyle and her determination has earned her many friends and fans through her illustrious career
2672571 its a situation in which your mind races wondering who could have been involved
2672572 the fact that elisabeth was there and witnessed it well she doesnt deserve that
2672573 how could it be that during a defining moment in your life such a tragedy as this could touch your family its got to be difficult for him

2672579 theyd need to shove the bill up my ass for me not to give them a fifth star
2672580 the defense got a few double plays it was stellar youre always going to give up runs here but i think the key is making it through six innings in this park
2672581 looking at the scoreboard i was thinking we have a little cushion but lets get an out
2672582 once we got that first out a big punchout of troy tulowitzki i think the momentum psychologically came back to our side
2672583 greg was deserving of a lot of wins in that stretch so its good to see him get three in a row
2672584 its not any more satisfying doing it here because you always want to succeed always want to win
2672585 its always good to see the family but just because people are here to see you you dont press or anything like that
2672586 ive had a couple of rough starts and its just unfortunate that theyve come in the middle of when were trying to make a run i cant dwell on it i just have to move forward
2672587 its a difficult stretch for aaron and a difficult stretch for us

2672595 i am pleased to report the unqualified success of the bicycle lanes laid down by willoughby council
2672596 i always enjoy reading the exhaustively researched opinions of cycling experts like rob herron times july 23
2672597 given the calibre and thrust of letters times july 30 attacking my suggestion that the new bicycle lanes in willoughby were an unnecessary waste of money they only serve to convince me of the correctness of my observations as they are clearly only there for the benefit of somewhat stupid riders and drivers directional arrows are a must my point for those who missed it was that the lanes are unnecessary and meaningless as any cyclists with half a brain would be riding in this section of the road anyway all the lanes do is add to cyclists already inflated sense of self importance at significant expense to ratepayers rob herron crows nest

2672672 but there have been times when ive run into a market quickly to grab a few things and didnt keep the receipts
2672673 wait this is the last episode and its doing a recap of the entire season they missed the point
2672674 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through

2672681 i suspect this pied piper phenomenon will pass rapidly and quietly
2672682 i hate to say it but theres probably been some more talented teams that have come before us but there was always a little something missing
2672683 dragan brought that winning mentality its not about winning this game or that game its about how you perform how you approach a game and even in loses making sure you are doing things and you are behaving like a winner
2672684 were here to compete we are here to show the world what we can do
2672685 there was a big change in the vision and the approach and the professionalism of the sport when we took on dragan as a coach
2672686 in every sphere of water polo canada im sure there was resistance some naysayers i cant imagine the work dragan and his close circle had to put up just to get things in motion
2672687 everyone knows their job everyone knows what to do weve come together and play a good team game
2672688 that is something we have been working hard on over the last four years as the results come in the confidence goes up we have more confidence in our game and the style we want to play
2672689 our training load is twice what most of the other teams is
2672690 there is no way they could train as much or as often and play as many games as we did over the last couple of years
2672691 we needed to get better to get up to that level
2672692 interestingly yesterday on the bbc one of the diplomats from israel said under no circumstances the country would allow any of these ships which are to deliver aid to palestinians in gaza
2672693 really that was a mistake from a diplomat on the part of his job because it shows that the security questions are not the reason they are blockading the sea and the lands around gaza
2672694 it appears to be a collective punishment for gaza and for the 1 5 million civilians living there
2672695 if you move in before the end of 2008 the law will not affect you at all

2672733 an answer to a driving problem that costs as many as 160 000 lives in the united states every year
2672734 whats different about ours is that it presents a larger view than many of the others to provide a big clear image of the car or person in your blind spot
2672735 while we have a multi generational catalog we do pride ourselves on coming up with items of special interest to baby boomers and beyond
2672736 we often find there are more constraints on our physical movements like turning the head over the shoulder or rotating the body both of which affect ones ability to deal with blind spot s and lane changes drivers who fear they cant rely on their mirrors frequently address the blind spot problem by turning their heads quickly and looking over a shoulder but for some even that limited a rotation can be a painful effort
2672737 you do get a much larger view and youre seeing it with both eyes
2672738 and the larger the vehicle the larger the blind spot suvs for instance have larger blind zones than small cars and a tractor trailer blind spot is huge ill bet theres no driver out there whos been on the road more than a few months who hasnt had the experience of checking the side mirror seeing nothing getting ready to pull out and hearing the blare of the horn of the car thats driving in the blind spot its a frightening moment and firststreet is pleased to offer an inexpensive easy and what we consider to be the best solution to a common and often dangerous problem
2672739 connecting great ideas and great people we look forward to meeting and greeting you
2672740 precipitous decline in the performance of the company and the conscious destruction of its entrepreneurial culture
2672741 when i retired as chairman allianz was a flourishing vibrant and profitable company with a unique culture that challenged motivated recognized and rewarded employees who worked to make themselves and the company better now
2672742 allianz life is a mere shadow of its former self and may be wounded beyond repair
2672743 a full blown bureaucratic management system has been substituted for an entrepreneurial culture bureaucratic managers have infiltrated the company bringing with them the calcifying taint of the bureaucratic culture
2672744 was that we like many companies are being impacted by the economic slowdown and an acute downturn in financial services
2672745 the problems with allianz life cannot be passed off to others
2672746 but must come to roost at the feet of an ineffective destructive bureaucratic management group and in this regard allianz life unfortunately serves as a wonderful case study for comparing the differences between a bureaucratic and entrepreneurial culture

2672772 the creation of baggames began on a surf trip to tamarindo costa rica where the evenings were the perfect downtime to play backgammon
2672773 the problem was we didnt bring a game because no one wanted to lug around a full sized board in our already stuffed backpacks we could have brought along a travel version but who really likes playing with those tiny little pieces on a miniature board anyway no one in town had even heard of backgammon much less had one for sale our only option was to conjure up our own makeshift board we found a small sign company to draw up the board per our description and used colones costa rican currency for the checkers

2672786 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2672787 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2672788 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2672789 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2672790 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2672791 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2672792 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2672793 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2672794 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2672795 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2672796 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2672797 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2672798 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2672799 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2672800 but i do support georgias president mikheil saakashvili and what russia is doing is wrong they must stop
2672801 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2672802 stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone
2672803 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2672804 its all this young love this yearning yearning can be so ah
2672805 stephenie just knows how to combine the right amount of danger and passion and not go over the top she teases you the passion and all that stepping to the edge of the cliff but not flying off
2672806 as i was coming home i heard the roar of jets
2672807 i fell to the ground instinctively and then there were these painfully loud bangs
2672808 they were such lovely people they were so excited about the baby
2672809 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2672810 they are killing civilians women and children with heavy artillery and rockets
2672811 there have certainly been a lot of casualties the street next to ours was hit by firing and we saw bodies being taken away we are staying inside the house we have got three young children and they are very frightened
2672812 i went out and saw burnt tanks with dead bodies the police said that they were georgians who had been trying to come into the city then we heard planes and what sounded like firing from helicopters but it is very confusing and we dont know whats really going on
2672813 our peacekeepers and units subordinate to them are now carrying out an operation to force the georgian side to peace
2672814 classical elements with some of the other things the choir does well
2672815 but the program was designed to show how they are somewhat interrelated to each other
2672816 im still able to do what i need to do
2672817 we just recently recorded an album of american folk hymns and spirituals that will be released next spring so i tried to select some things that we had recently prepared
2672818 we are always fortunate to have our own sound folks with us that do a great job in ensuring that everybody can hear and the sound is good
2672819 we are doing things that the choir does particularly well of the music that weve done over the years the things that are the most requested are the hymns and folk music is also high on the list
2672820 i think that the audience will feel a lot of joy and affirmation
2672821 under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2672822 we saw the impact of the air strikes buildings on fire we could hear the russian jets above us
2672823 in one air strike the pilot missed the intended military base instead hitting two apartment blocks
2672824 when we arrived flames were pouring out of the buildings and people were still trapped inside
2672825 a woman begged the firemen and soldiers to help find her family she said shed gone into the burning apartment block but had not been able to find them
2672826 we saw injured civilians being pulled from the buildings we saw at least one man pulled out dead
2672827 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2672828 ossettia is georgias territory it has been undermined by terrorists funded by moscow
2672829 this is because russia wants to punish georgia for its democratic stance and its western ties at the moment there are between several hundred and two thousand people dead this conflict is not ethnic its not religious its about russia wanting georgia to be subordinate to them
2672830 it is vital for leaders on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2672831 whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2672832 in order to consider withdrawal of our forces we must make sure that there is no chance of genocide there
2672833 there is a straightforward way to stop fighting to stop killing for georgians to withdraw and then to have an agreement on non use of force signed and then we can talk on other verity things including on military and political arrangements
2672834 certain georgian military activity which is supported from outside of south ossetia
2672835 we are reminded that sports can act as a tool that can bridge cultures and cross linguistic and ideological barriers as global citizens we are all well aware of the fact that the sports experience is priceless to be outdoors routing for your home team and spending time with friends and loved ones

2672851 todays corporate leaders are already very conscious of using green practices when considering new facilities and they expect green building to have an increasing impact on the future
2672852 the challenge for many networked embedded systems is there is no way to distinguish critical packets from the large volume of non essential ethernet traffic
2672853 ethernet packets are processed on a first come first served basis important packets are left to wait while the packets that arrived ahead of them are processed for embedded systems this leads to systems that are not responsive or worse fail to meet essential deadlines
2672854 previously such sophisticated packet processing was only available in much larger and costlier systems
2672855 quality of service qos standards have been driven by the it industry but have not been broadly adopted in the embedded market due to its complexity and cost the prioritized ethernet framework for the rtxc quadnet tcp ip suite now offers an affordable solution for delivering this capability to embedded systems
2672856 we were a little surprised at the number of people ordering patriotic
2672857 patriotic checks have always been a great category but now our vote republican checks and vote democrat personal checks have rapidly moved up the list of best sellers
2672858 many people are shocked when they find out they can actually save money and get themed personal checks
2672859 the fact is that we offer nearly a thousand different personal check designs and they are priced at or below the prices banks charge

2672867 we researched various companies in spain picked one and bought a home from them off plan we began to worry when nothing seemed to be progressing every time we visited to see how our home was coming along we learned about more problems and we came away very worried about our investment in the end it got to the point where we were so concerned we decided to cut our losses and pull out it worked out for the best in the end as we now own a beautiful taylor woodrow www taylorwoodrow es home but this new safe buying scheme would have saved us a lot of time and trouble had it been in place when we first began our search

2672885 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
2672886 we are proud to offer our patients the advantage of this cutting edge application of radiation technology because it promotes less x ray exposure and allows for convenient treatment when patients want care
2672887 that cumulative x ray exposure from ct scans and other sources can be very harmful so we always want to do what we can to minimize x ray exposure for patients

2672894 there is so much conflicting information directed at the public about what to eat what is healthy what supplements to buy and what to do about various health diagnoses i felt it was important to get healthcare practitioners together to work as a team for each client we can now offer a comfortable setting to get reliable information to clients and to also give them tools and training for how to apply this knowledge in their daily lives

2672900 i was thrilled when pinkcalyx com received its first customer inquiry for a pair of mens wedding band s but i was also surprised that the couple chose our website
2672901 being a small business it is not easy to compete against internet giants who receive the lions share of traffic from jewelry shoppers
2672902 i was stunned to find out that the gay community is not being courted by internet giants like bluenile com nor by brick and mortar outlets
2672903 the best thing about my job is that i have relationships with the most talented designers in the world so i partnered with constantine who specializes in pure 24 karat gold jewelry we came up with a design that is organic hand made and absolutely exquisite

2672909 with the michigan economy already on the skids as gas prices went up we saw our prospects dwindle
2672910 we couldnt move the store to another part of the country so we needed to come up with some way to get people back in the showroom
2672911 we tried several other promotions reduced prices on furniture extended payments but nothing seems to work like the free gas
2672912 this is shaping up to be one of our most successful promotions yet for businesses

2672919 the positive characteristics of this book is that it was a simple story of a topic children can relate to of being lost or not being able to find see someone they love some of the children talked about not seeing their grandma for long times and they seem to relate to nana
2672920 this is a great story to help children feel that they are never alone and are always being watched over
2672921 the characters in the story were cute and the illustrations were attractive and appealing to my children having the plush to go along with the book made it more fun for the children the story taught a lesson about fear and loneliness something everyone experiences at one time or another
2672922 this is a great story to help children feel that they are never alone and are always being watched over

2672965 yo quiero pensar que tendremos unos presupuestos del estado tan respetuosos con el modelo de financiaci n que propone el estatut que no tendremos ning n problema en votarlo
2672966 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
2672967 nu ne temem de rapid ii respectam si ne vom juca sansa
2672968 this is someone who thinks he can do anything to anybody at any time
2672969 its important to have this cynical hard nosed group of national reporters to put those who want to be president to the test
2672970 but in peoria and albuquerque reporters have an obligation to report on what the candidate said and to do it that day thats good too
2672971 decent good honest wonderful people who love their country and cherish the constitution of the united states

2672980 and the gasoline for the crimes that we have will run out
2672981 this medal is good for georgia especially during times like this
2672982 i am very nervous today its very difficult for my people
2672983 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars
2672984 we live in the 21st century after all we shouldnt really stoop so low to wage wars against each other
2672985 its very difficult for us as georgians because of everything thats going on at home it was nice that natalia paderina came up to me after and gave me a handshake
2672986 as far as the hugging and kissing goes i do that with many friends i have many friends around the world and will always do that there should be no hatred among athletes and people
2672987 politicians should straighten out the situation today and if they dont well have to get involved
2672988 all through his life he wanted to be a firefighter
2672989 matt hammer was special matt called me he was at a seminary school and said he wanted a job typically i want to meet someone before we hire them i want to look at their hands see if they can work
2672990 but as i talked to matt i made him an offer right there there was just something about him one of his callings was an evangelist minister i always had him do a morning prayer before we went on to a fire he wasnt maybe the greatest preacher but everything he said came from the heart
2672991 i can pretty much tell you exactly what they were feeling when they boarded
2672992 they would have been excited we all love to fly in helicopters
2672993 you run into the attitude oh you are just another contractor
2672994 shawn blazer a good dependable honest person who was working to make a career out of it he was 30 older than most single with no kids he took care of his mom scott charleson scott was a guy i recruited this year he was an all star defense lacrosse player at southern oregon university out of ashland matt hammer matt hammer is rough
2672995 its really sad after the celebration of the opening ceremonies which were the best opening ceremonies ive ever been at
2672996 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2672997 the only comfort is that wiz was not injured in the heinous attack
2672998 two of the most supportive and friendly people that i have ever encountered they love the sport and are beloved in the volleyball community
2672999 its been a boatload of money to put it colloquially
2673000 the public needs to appreciate how seriously we took the 70 vote for jessicas law and public safety
2673001 was it like a crisis yes anybody who was willing to take on evaluations at any time and in any place could literally work around the clock
2673002 they were just saying take them take them take them
2673003 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2673004 i for the life of me cant imagine how that could be a proportional response to allegations that georgians had fired upon russian peacekeepers
2673005 the machinery moved no one is working and the parking lots have reopened people are shopping
2673006 i read shakespeare and the bible and i can shoot dice thats what i call a liberal education
2673007 if you know a sufi interested in matters related to the narration of hadith then brush him aside
2673008 what benefit could a person who directly learns from the creator possibly gain from listening to a creature like abdur razzaq
2673009 you acquire knowledge from the mortals whereas we derive knowledge from the everlasting who will never pass away
2673010 all paths are blocked before people except for those who follow in the footsteps of the messenger peace and blessings be upon him
2673011 he who has not memorized the quran and learned hadith shouldnt be followed in this matter sufism for our knowledge is to be derived solely from the quran and the sunnah
2673012 he who does not weigh his deeds at all times in light of the quran and sunnah and does not question his own ideas then he is not among the men of sufism
2673013 if a person is made to perform some miracles and you witness him go up in the air still you should not take him as a model until you see whether he abides by the commands and regulations of the shari ah or not
2673014 i allah was a hidden treasure and i wanted to be known so i created the creation so that they know me
2673015 we the sufis consider this hadith as authentic by means of
2673016 studying and verifying the chain of transmission is part of allahs religion without which any one would be able to make whatever allegations one likes
2673017 and the gasoline for the crimes that we have will run out
2673018 this is a very complex issue and our understanding of it continues to grow
2673019 both dental and medical professionals need to maintain open lines of communication with each other to ensure the best care for their patients who are taking bisphosphonates
2673020 were at the point where were saying thank god 80 per cent of them are using an illegal drug rather than alcohol even though in 10 years theyll be suffering manic depressive disorders
2673021 but we just couldnt deal with that many people affected by alcohol
2673022 it is embarrassing weve sworn an oath to do certain things and were not being given the resources to achieve that
2673023 it s a difference maker it can mean the difference between a medal or no medal when you re talking about athletes at this level
2673024 we ve seen evidence over the last 10 years from studies which all show that recovery has become more and more important especially in this kind of warm weather
2673025 the body doesnt settle down until the core cools down so athletes come to us all the time and say they feel more lethargic and tired when they dont do these sessions
2673026 it would be just like a power cut of the electrical supply to the heart
2673027 you cant wrap them in cotton wool or never let them out yes theyve got a condition but thats not the life we want them to have rhiann tells everyone she has a special heart
2673028 when you are 50 you may injure your body more easily than when you were 20
2673029 joints tissues and muscles may not be as flexible as they used to be so as you get older you need to take extra steps to protect yourself from injuries when you exercise
2673030 flashes of fire and heard sporadic gunshots after the explosions
2673031 the lawbreakers drove a taxi to the local public security office industry and business administration and other sites and tossed homemade explosives destroying two police vehicles
2673032 were known to have been killed in a series of explosions
2673033 the circumstances are still unclear our leaders havent determined the nature of the incident yet
2673034 we know that testosterone makes males more susceptible to disease we wanted to find out if it impacts their behaviour as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease
2673035 our plan was to raise the testosterone levels in wild mice and measure the disease risk they posed to the population
2673036 you use the monkey bread fruit if you have a belly ache
2673037 if youre tired you eat the leaves they are good for you
2673038 fourteen percent of emissions from all sources in australia is from enteric methane from cattle and sheep
2673039 and if you look at another country such as new zealand which has got a much higher agricultural base theyre actually up around 50 percent
2673040 my feeling is the issue should have been aired and people should have had the opportunity to speak and vote it up or down
2673041 the caucus system is the exact opposite of everything ive been fighting for in terms of maximizing democratic input
2673042 that we have put 18 million cracks in the highest glass ceiling
2673043 there are different approaches within the democratic party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage
2673044 wasnt effectively controlled by obama although his people certainly had a hand in it hes the candidate and he will have to run on this platform thats not unreasonable the issue of the caucuses wont be resolved here at the platform it will be resolved on the dnc level and they will have their full day in court i guarantee you
2673045 understand how a person comes to the u s senate and before theyve done one thing there decides they can be president
2673046 its a challenge for midsize cities to raise this kind of money for conventions like these
2673047 i think both the rnc and the dnc recognize they are going to have to find a way to do things a little differently in the future
2673048 has full confidence that he will be able to close the gap
2673049 by law the presidential candidates themselves cannot receive unlimited corporate contributions
2673050 but those who are fundraising for them can receive those contributions and apply it to the biggest advertisement of the presidential campaign the nominating convention
2673051 this is someone who thinks he can do anything to anybody at any time
2673052 but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2673053 i thought i was purchasing a fair chance to win
2673054 the issue is how long do you leave a ticket in the marketplace knowing there may not be a top prize left but loads and loads of lower tier prizes
2673055 a lot of players dont play it for the jackpot they play for the intermediate prizes
2673056 they get mad if we close a game too soon
2673057 i think the serious players pay attention to those things
2673058 when i get talking about the case people are in agreement its not right theyre making thousands and thousands of dollars after the initial grand prize has been won
2673059 no one would play a game with zero grand prizes consumers do want to know which games are prize rich
2673060 i think theres an unusual split in the group we havent seen in the past
2673061 exactly because funding va programs commands bipartisan support some in the congress like to attach unrelated pork barrel appropriations and earmarks to va bills
2673062 the result is to mix vital national priorities with wasteful and often worthless political pork
2673063 let me make very clear this card is not intended to either replace the va or privatize veterans healthcare as some have wrongly charged
2673064 out into the local economy in hope that someone can take care of their combat wounds its essentially privatization something i cannot support
2673065 well have a simple principle for veterans sleeping on our streets zero tolerance
2673066 could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
2673067 would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2673068 its important to have this cynical hard nosed group of national reporters to put those who want to be president to the test
2673069 but in peoria and albuquerque reporters have an obligation to report on what the candidate said and to do it that day thats good too
2673070 decent good honest wonderful people who love their country and cherish the constitution of the united states
2673071 sen obamas run for president has the world witnessing history
2673072 he was promising it up on the stage but behind the scenes he was admitting it wouldnt go anywhere
2673073 when i read the previous disclaimer i shook with deep dark laughter and then remembered that i had eaten a bunch of hallucinogenic mushrooms earlier and that this wasnt funny at all
2673074 ca m me t trop vite jaurais presque pr f r rester un peu plus longtemps sur le court
2673075 this part is boring they should just drum and start playing sports
2673076 got up very early in the morning at about half past six after breakfast start to the largest temple called

2673078 henry the tuatara a lizard like creature of prehistoric origin had grown fat and lazy after arriving at southland museum in the remote
2673079 he wasnt interested in sex until a cancerous tumour was removed from his bottom
2673080 he bit the tail off his previous female companion twice but since the operation his hormones have been raging

2673093 dennis hopper makes an appearance as a judge who defends his courthouse by gunning down aclu lawyers trying to take down the ten commandments
2673094 the accepted way to speak about america is in the voice that disrespects it and the voice thats unacceptable is the one that loves america

2673118 eu sunt salvat si am primit iertarea prin crucea lui isus hristos si pentru c eu fac am facut voi face munci bune fapte bune etc
2673119 few movies have been so adept at providing easy metaphors for their own incompetence
2673120 curious lack of levity and joy the sort of quality that makes a comic book
2673121 the filmmakers free citizens stood up and produced the propaganda themselves at their own cost and for their own benefit
2673122 the point though is not that you need to think about these things no teenager or film critic who views the film is likely to pick up on the allegory
2673123 from certain angles the city the joker threatens looks like new york but it would be reductive to read the film too directly through the prism of 9 11 and its aftermath
2673124 but well never get our return on investment with it
2673125 this is the year weve got to put a number on the board that impresses
2673126 its a show me story and weve yet to perform we know that
2673127 some theme parks held up in the last recession but this is a different downturn so you cant necessarily say they will hold up during this one
2673128 we arent where we want to be but i think we are heading in the right direction
2673129 its just whether we have enough money so i need to make recognizable progress this year
2673130 stockholders would have been better off hiding their money under a mattress
2673131 our lack of pricing power was really a big surprise to me
2673132 that fits no one complains about that and we signed up ben amp jerrys to sell ice cream that fits disney does some of this but they are too subtle
2673133 we see it as an interest free loan and given this credit environment youve got to take advantage of that
2673134 there are too many yellow flags like weather or the broader economy to guarantee it
2673135 but if current trends continue then we can get there
2673136 but no one knows for sure weve never had 4 a gallon gas its obviously not the economic environment i would have chosen
2673137 the cost of filling up would never have crossed my mind in the past
2673138 but we decided this time not to buy any souvenirs or any of the pictures they try to sell
2673139 a lot of times it takes longer than you like longer than you want
2673140 a lot of companies that are consumer cyclical are down now
2673141 no one anticipated gas would be where it is or this real estate market but we think if mark gets the cash flow to positive the market will reward him and us
2673142 we must not continue to abuse and destroy our environment
2673143 recovery and rehabilitation of natural resources where it is even possible is incredibly costly by permitting the deterioration of vermonts natural beauty and resources we are committing an inexcusable offense against our children and their children
2673144 report of the governors commission on vermonts future guidelines for growth
2673145 better management of our resources through the establishment of a planning process and a method of protecting open land agriculture and housing will be a significant step toward securing the future we want
2673146 is useful in trying to understand and anticipate the forces that will shape the states future
2673147 gone are kerosene lamps and outhouses one room schools and one horse shays crank telephones and poor farms consumption of sulphur and molasses circus posters and minstrel shows
2673148 vermont has entered the world of jets computers ulcers tranquilizers nuclear power four lane highways shopping center complexes color television and mobile homes
2673149 an environment of natural and creative inspiration an environment which contributes positively to healthful individual and family living
2673150 nature and past generations of vermonters have bestowed a unique environmental legacy that must be wisely used for the benefit of society
2673151 although difficult to document the social cost of disruption of traditional patterns of living must be recognized as considerable
2673152 the sense of community is lost antagonisms are created between the invaders and invaded in new areas of concentrated settlement
2673153 the uses and abuses of the land have an impact on the state as a whole
2673154 absolute local autonomy in environmental matters is proving obsolete and unworkable broader jurisdiction over land use decisions is essential standards should be established and maintained on a statewide basis

2673158 what is required for the realization and integrated development by design is a decision and statement by vermonters that they want progress but on their own terms
2673159 adoption of such a development policy will be costly it will take time and sustained effort it will meet vigorous opposition from selfish interests it will mean acceptance of controls and sacrifice of absolute property rights and it will require enormous citizen initiative

2673161 heard much about the inability of the existing regulatory process both at the state and local level to effectively manage development
2673162 this feeling has led to calls for stronger statewide planning as well as for more local control
2673163 the commission believes that comprehensive plans must be developed at the local regional and state levels and that the plans should be integrated with each other the process should be guided by statewide policies but controlled from the bottom up
2673164 we are hearing that we still need to find the juncture where we can bring in good people and jobs and not ruin the land air and water that brings them here
2673165 we in vermont have framed our future in terms of this dichotomy for a long time the conversation is still there but its important to ask if it is useful perhaps its time to ask ourselves whats beyond the either or situation

2673167 the possibilities of the future for vermont are tremendous and exciting the dangers are equally apparent

2673171 better management of our resources through the establishment of a planning process and a method of protecting open land agriculture and housing will be a significant step toward securing the future we want

2673174 vermont has entered the world of jets computers ulcers tranquilizers nuclear power four lane highways shopping center complexes color television and mobile homes
2673175 an environment of natural and creative inspiration an environment which contributes positively to healthful individual and family living
2673176 nature and past generations of vermonters have bestowed a unique environmental legacy that must be wisely used for the benefit of society
2673177 although difficult to document the social cost of disruption of traditional patterns of living must be recognized as considerable
2673178 the sense of community is lost antagonisms are created between the invaders and invaded in new areas of concentrated settlement
2673179 the uses and abuses of the land have an impact on the state as a whole
2673180 absolute local autonomy in environmental matters is proving obsolete and unworkable broader jurisdiction over land use decisions is essential standards should be established and maintained on a statewide basis

2673194 ls pilares se derrumban el amor se akaba pero l amistad sincera solo l muert l separa

2673196 ls amigs son esos angeles k te levantan kuand tus alas an olvidao cm volar
2673197 so i was faced with a question will i or wont i at the time of the 1988 seoul olympics i was now basically an old man for an athlete and so i investigated it and met with a particular doctor in who told me how it would help me overcome injuries in terms of allowing me to train harder for longer and recover quicker without breaking down so i almost came close to crossing the line
2673198 the cross i had to bear was my own disappointment of not winning an olympic gold medal which had been instilled in me as a kid and the thought of not fulfilling what i had dreamed of made me very depressed
2673199 i was sucked in because the then minister for sport ireland because they hadnt made an appointment fahey thought this would be a good opportunity to have somebody of my international status in athletics heading it up my 144 days of working there almost drove me to suicide because i got seriously depressed as a result of my life it was genuine
2673200 i was sitting in the stands with olympic teammates and the general reaction amongst the people in the stands when he won was oh f he got away with it
2673201 behind the scenes lewis complained about johnsons obvious use of drugs so when johnson tested positive for steroids a few days later we all sang from the same hymn sheet great we got him at last
2673202 this x generation who are competing now are like zombies staring into their mobile phones all day long sending text messages listening to their
2673203 too much pampering goes on the agents make the decisions book the airline tickets do the deals organise the hotels they dont know how to look after themselves because theyve been spoon fed when i was on the scene we were path finders we did our own wheeling and dealing even getting in a queue outside a hotel room like we were some kind of drug dealer to collect our cash in an envelope
2673204 i really believe its an inverted pyramid the money is supporting the athletes who are on the borderline of breaking through but no money is put into their development at juvenile level we have talked about this for 20 years and nothing is being done about it because they are afraid money will be wasted i really believe it is vital to invest heavily in primary schools
2673205 the irish athletes are super stars at division one level i wouldnt criticise them whatsoever but lets call a spade a spade
2673206 there are a dime a dozen sprinters at their disciplines from other countries so for our athletes to get through into the second and third round thats the best we can hope for
2673207 it was a burden i held personally for a long time because i genuinely believed i could win gold not silver not bronze but gold and i lost out on gold by three tenths of a second and finished fourth
2673208 i lost out a second time when i was sick and injured by a second which i never told anybody at the time however in 1994 at the age of 41 i became the first person over 40 to run a sub four minute mile it was a personal mission it was a way of redeeming myself i went out on my own terms
2673209 the disappointments have made me a stronger person so looking back i wouldnt change anything
2673210 joseph dufour was the leading french maker of scenic wallpapers during the french empire and restoration periods known for fine engravings of views of paris london and constatinople he produced a lot of wallpapers after 1815 for export to england and america
2673211 well yep things seem to be going back to normal whoop de stinking doo
2673212 it was significant but i havent seen much but i know things changed but im not sure what it means yet and i cant believe its over yet but kind of glad it is
2673213 the new yorker may think as one of their staff explained to us that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature senator obamas right wing critics have tried to create
2673214 but most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
2673215 satirizes the use of scare tactics and misinformation in the presidential election to derail barack obamas campaign
2673216 i got out of work at 9 p m and was waiting at the ihop resturaunt across the street to make sure i wasnt the only guy on line
2673217 ive waited on lines for black fridays and the xboxes before
2673218 its easier for me to have because i can have one this device to use for personal use as well as a pda for business
2673219 you must each make up your own mind as to how much you should give
2673220 dont give reluctantly or in response to pressure for god loves the person who gives cheerfully
2673221 if you are really eager to give it isnt important how much you are able to give
2673222 give to caesar what is caesars and to god what is gods
2673223 take care dont do your good deeds publicly to be admired give your gifts in secret
2673224 for it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this not from yourselves it is the gift of god not by works

2673234 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2673235 the waraos told us it was because there were too many bats that were biting the children
2673236 i wanted to go for the record but i wasnt sure if i should but then in the warm up room i kind of got these chills in my body and started getting excited
2673237 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through

2673240 our initial idea was to empower users by creating a venue for demand seekers and solution providers this system has since evolved and will soon be a global lead delivery system this is just the first phase and a taste of where post net is headed
2673241 soon our users will have the ability to create custom sub portals and have the ability to advertise their own brands within the network this system is a testament to the evolution of technology with daily human interactions
2673242 a franchise in a historical town people come to nevada city to get away from franchises
2673243 im standing up for the beliefs about historic towns what next starbucks
2673244 this city was built 159 years ago it was built on mom and pops
2673245 we heard about it and we were shocked and disappointed
2673246 were not doing anything wrong weve followed all of the historical guidelines
2673247 we didnt go in thinking we were doing something wrong
2673248 we will be reflective of what nevada city wants it to be were not a fast food chain
2673249 its one of those red flag words but were not here to cannibalize the market
2673250 someone has their life savings involved in the business they need to understand that theyre local businesses and independent businesspeople
2673251 theres a great fear of franchises coming in its very common
2673252 the thought is that they will destroy the social landscape theres certainly a concern by small business but if its something the community doesnt want they dont have to patronize it they can vote with their dollars
2673253 i will advise kashmiri pandits not to take a foolish step to return to the valley and those leaders who have sympathy with the pandits return leave kashmir and stay with them in jammu

2673260 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2673261 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2673262 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2673263 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2673264 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2673265 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2673266 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2673267 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2673269 bila tan sri jins shamsudin dilantik sebagai senator itu satu petanda positif buat industri ruang yang diberi kerajaan menjadi saluran terbaik untuk menyuarakan hasrat masyarakat seni di dewan negara
2673270 bagaimanapun menyambut baik cadangan ini bukan bermakna saya mempertikai kredibiliti tan sri tiada siapa boleh mempertikai kewibawaan tan sri kerana jasanya dalam industri sangat besar malah saya sangat mengagumi jiwa patriotiknya
2673271 secara peribadi saya melihat tiada salahnya andai diwujudkan senator kedua atau mungkin ketiga keempat dan kelima daripada kalangan penggiat seni jika ia boleh diterima pakai
2673272 sebelah kaki sudah ada di parlimen jika dilengkapkan sepasang dan dimasukkan tangan pasti impaknya lebih baik lagipun selaras dengan perkembangan semasa industri perlukan banyak suara yang lebih dinamik dan pragmatik
2673273 saya tidak mengatakan diri saya adalah calon itu tapi jika dibukakan jalan saya tidak menolak seronok jika dapat bekerjasama dengan tan sri lagipun ini memang satu daripada visi saya
2673274 selama ini ramai memandang bidang seni sebelah mata dan skopnya sangat kecil malah penggiat seni dicop cetek akal dan hanya tahu berhibur kosong
2673275 bagi saya pandangan itu sama sekali tidak adil kita ada ramai penggiat seni berpendidikan tinggi berpengalaman dan tahu hal ehwal negara
2673276 lagipun untuk menjadi jaguh pada bangsanya saya percaya tidak semestinya perlu bermula sebagai ahli politik dengan wujudnya ruang sebegini dalam dewan negara kita boleh memperjuangkan bidang yang diwakili
2673277 jeritan itu bukan kosong tetapi penuh bermakna jujur dalam usia 40 an saya terpanggil menyuntik semangat dan membuka minda anak bangsa

2673282 me parece que todos venimos a sumar desde el lugar que les toque estar cada uno llega a ver que pasa aparte nos vamos esforzando en cada entrenamiento para ser tenidos en cuenta por el momento no me preocupa si estar entre los iniciales o no sino me preocupa ponerme bien y estar a disposici n del entrenador
2673283 no me cost mucho adaptarme a esta ciudad yo soy de carmen de patagones y es parecido a la banda una ciudad tranquila s en capital federal y c rdoba pero como te dec a anteriormente vengo de un pueblo parecido al de aqu la gente bande a es muy c lida nos demuestra mucho cari o por lo que trataremos de sacarle todo el jugo a la situaci n

2673291 were seeing more price reductions in properties listed on the market which is having a levelling impact on the housing price increases experienced at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2008
2673292 there was a slight decline in the total active listings on the market in july compared to june which is a welcomed departure from recent trends
2673293 i wanted to go for the record but i wasnt sure if i should but then in the warm up room i kind of got these chills in my body and started getting excited
2673294 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2673295 i wasnt really happy to turn and see all three of us together at the 200m point i wasnt really comfortable with that close a race i normally have more of a gap

2673308 es peligroso que en ese caldero de odios que llamamos medio oriente que un pa s se arme de manera ostensible con arsenales de armas nucleares y que inspire a otros pa ses a hacer lo mismo

2673316 and i am certainly not handing out cash in exchange for a lecture
2673317 if you want this arrangement to continue you will find a way to praise me for what i am doing right instead of clucking your tongue at me for what i am neglecting to do
2673318 really are you kidding me right now sell by dates
2673319 its like a ticket stub its a remnant of something you did that you have proof of
2673320 you can see somebody clearly in a polaroid theres just no hiding who they are
2673321 i see this guy in mount vernon all the time she just had a baby she was visiting from new orleans
2673322 polaroid has always had these amazing customers who enjoy our film which makes us feel good
2673323 my hope is that existing customers and a new generation of customers find new ways to act as creatively
2673324 you kind of wonder if any of this would have made any difference earlier on
2673325 the self described neanderthal of the grand old party emphasis old has been catching flack for admitting he is no techno geek he not only did not invent the internet he can barely use it
2673326 although its superficially attractive thats the kind of statement that glosses over so many different facts that in the end its simply wrong
2673327 lincoln was not an expert in the use of the telegraph he didnt use it to win 1860 or 1864 and with jfk it was basically more of an accident he did the tv debate and everybody saw that he did much better than his opponent richard nixon because it was a razor close election with the wisdom of hindsight everybody said kennedy understood television but kennedy was not an expert on tv any more than obama himself is an expert on the internet
2673328 forging a mass movement and making a tidy profit in the process
2673329 putting a 10 year old quaker in charge of the strategic air command
2673330 i think publishers have concluded the only games that work are the surefire 500 million box office kind of games like
2673331 the transformers game really surprised people how well it did but the movie was big i dont think they expected the dark knight movie to be this big
2673332 why did they put the same types of groups on at the same time
2673333 todays been a walk in the park its been a treat
2673334 it sounds good and the stages are a lot closer in toronto its on an island at least here you can park your car and walk in
2673335 i love bands and i love djs its the only festival where i can satisfy both those needs

2673337 having no experience in this field i enlisted my incredibly creative friend barbara dale together we came up with franny and freddy get fried
2673338 any kind any time im partial to peanut m amp ms and berger cookies but ive recently gone over to the dark side i can now defend my addiction by citing the health benefits
2673339 my cells such an antique it still sits in a cradle in my car and the reception is pathetic the all in one concept is attractive but i worry about developing another addiction
2673340 im totally surrounded by boys my husband son and two male corgis jackson and william have finally calmed down so its time to introduce a little more chaos into our lives
2673341 baltimore really needs to promote this mode of transportation and recreation
2673342 both asia and the west have elite culture but in china confucian forms dominate
2673343 this panda is a flunky who haggles for his own selfish ends
2673344 given the political overlay it becomes very difficult in china to make movies
2673345 if you start off with a fat lazy panda a national symbol someone is bound to come along and say we cant give an image to the world that china is fat and lazy
2673346 if kung fu panda were produced in china audiences would be sniping at the director for not setting a good example
2673347 in cartoon school we learned to combine instruction and entertainment
2673348 but we had a certain tradition before china opened up and its hard to get away from that overnight
2673349 you couldnt have violence or blood which meant no confrontation or drama it was impossible to create anything in the end i didnt want to waste two years of my life on this propaganda so i quit
2673350 as a new company we have promoted our packaging at events where celebrities tried our water and love it we wanted to make sure everyone could enjoy our product so it is now available on amazon com and we have made it available for free shipping
2673351 it is true that celebrities love our water but it is also true that everyone loves our water i recently exhibited at the gogreen expo in new york city and saw over ten thousand attendees a lot of them asked when we were going to start to deliver our great tasting bottled water to new york city homes and offices well now we do offer delivery and it can qualify for free shipping on amazon com
2673352 making successful hotel developments and investments in the asian hotel market
2673353 rents which we thought we would get in two years were getting now
2673354 there are large amounts of capital now chasing increasingly limited investment grade real estate opportunities in asia
2673355 we are in the closing stages of packaging the investment of private equity real estate funds for new condo hotel developments in manila and cebu with expected rental returns which continue to grow at a rapid pace
2673356 people are in general looking to shift fund flows relatively towards asia
2673357 it already has had a profound impact in markets where theres a lot of this money chasing the same assets
2673358 a lot of this interest is being driven by the relatively cheap market prices here compared to europe and the easy payment options available for condominium hotel developments
2673359 the buyers gain rental incomes that on todays purchase prices give a projected roi of some 8 to 14 percent depending on the mode of payment for the unit
2673360 en otros tiempos ser a un motivo de orgullo del xito de la tecnolog a israel pero no en d as en los que georgia se encuentra en conflicto con rusia pa s al que israel exige que frene su asistencia a ir n mejor no despertar y enfadar al oso ruso
2673361 al principio el ministerio de defensa se hizo el duro y quiso presionar a rusia para que deje de ayudar a ir n y siria con el suministro de armas
2673362 es cierto que es delicado el apoyo a georgia por ordenes de arriba hemos tenido que bajar el perfil y reducir el suministro
2673363 debemos tener mucho tacto rusia ya vende mucho arsenal a ir n y siria y no debemos darle otro pretexto para que les den armas m s modernas
2673364 cada intermediario que representa una compa a israel y llegaba a georgia le era asignado un familiar del ministro de defensa que le abr a las puertas todo queda en familia
2673365 no hay que exagerar la asistencia militar israel a georgia es limitada y no se puede comparar con otros pa ses como estados unidos por ejemplo los rusos agradecen que israel se negara la venta de tanques
2673366 todos nuestros proyectos para el gobierno de georgia realizados con el permiso del ministerio de defensa israel fueron terminados hace tiempo

2673370 then as now the only plausible answer is from the union of a man and a woman the biological fact is attended by the cultural assumptions of the world in which the writers lived woman for example was subordinate to man
2673371 the strangers in a carnal sense we should not neglect the fact that the fate of the city was determined well before the ugly incident at lots door
2673372 the statements are clear but the context and application are not
2673373 in other words the creatures ignored the creator and they themselves became the objects of their own worship and veneration
2673374 you demolish them this is what we do this is what got me here
2673375 i think its close to three billion people gonna be watching that game thats a lot of people
2673376 free agency now is becoming a global thing when players become free agents the team theyre currently with their competition is no longer the rest of the teams in the nba its global the market has opened up
2673377 its not even on my mind i saw where bogut chris and deron all got those extensions they worked hard for that and im happy for them but from a personal standpoint i havent concerned myself with that right now at all i love atlanta and ill let god take care of everything else
2673378 so if you really think your script is amazing and you dont have an agent or manager there are several ways to expose yourself to the entertainment community you can try what most writers do and submit query letters dont send query letters by snail mail no one reads those well maybe the interns do and they make fun and keep the worst ones to share around the office sometimes if your script has a real catchy logline then you can try email but most agents and managers will delete after reading the subject line at this point my eyes are trained to delete query emails the same way ive been trained to delete viagra emails in my opinion one of the best ways for a brand new writer to get exposure is to submit your screenplay to screenwriting festivals a good one is the nicholl screenwriting fellowship you may not get many agents calling you but if your script is good you will get managers and smaller producers calling you they have more time to read these scripts and they will request the top 5 scripts of the competition once this happens your script will make its way around town maybe not the right way but you need to start somewhere
2673379 wanted pa to film company producer must be able to type make a decent cup of coffee and write coverage
2673380 fuck it im gonna write my way out of this shit
2673381 buy this doohicky for us 300 and all your worries melt away
2673382 u s stocks are applauding the sharp pullback in commodity prices
2673383 it means lower inflationary pressures and basically gives a tax cut to the consumer
2673384 my expectation is that market functioning will improve markedly by 2009
2673385 you have a problematic scenario falling home prices rising food and energy prices the credit crunch and the labor market isnt doing that well
2673386 i just dont think the financials are really showing enough health
2673387 theres going to be some opportunities coming up but i just dont think were done with the downside yet
2673388 the broad theme of the elections has been explained to the agencies
2673389 the contemporary political scenario in india would be reflected in the campaign
2673390 theres not going to be a rapid recovery expectations of a turnaround in earnings are a pipe dream
2673391 the gdp report the decline in oil prices and the computer sales from dell came together to make a pretty good week for stocks
2673392 we dont want to be on the sidelines of this market
2673393 nos invitaron a dise ar una ciudad de cero carbono
2673394 de ninguna forma intentamos imponer una arquitectura est ndar internacional en masdar nos esforzamos por conseguir un equilibrio de luz y calor
2673395 esta zona padece nicamente tres meses de calor extremo y el resto del a o es bastante h meda
2673396 empezaremos con una gran estaci n de energ a solar que proveer la energ a para construir la ciudad cerca de 80 por ciento de toda la superficie de los tejados se usar para generar electricidad solar y como esperamos que la tecnolog a mejore conforme la construyamos esperamos poder luego eliminar la planta de luz podr amos tomar prestada energ a del exterior pero estamos tratando de demostrar que toda puede generarse dentro de los l mites del sitio
2673397 the city was flawless with lights billboards and the smell of fossil fuel
2673398 something washed over me and i connected to the spirit of the city
2673399 krok konieczny dla ochrony ludno ci cywilnej przed humanitarn katastrof
2673400 the financial sector is going to continue to be a drain
2673401 the market had a short time period of feeling like its over and we escaped now theres a realization that this isnt over
2673402 i think overall the strength in stocks right now is on fairly firm footing
2673403 there are no perfect human beings persons can be found who are good very good indeed in fact great there do in fact exist creators seers sages saints shakers and movers even if they are uncommon and do not come by the dozen and yet these very same people can at times be boring irritating petulant selfish angry or depressed to avoid disillusionment with human nature we must first give up our illusions about it
2673404 there is no worse sickness for the soul o you who are proud than this pretense of perfection
2673405 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2673406 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2673407 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2673408 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i will have a chance for tomorrow i have to wait but its great to be here
2673409 i guess the course is going to change quite a bit
2673410 its still going to be playing difficult but probably not to the extreme it was playing the last couple of days
2673411 i made a double bogey at the 18th because i was so mad i was almost fighting for the lead and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the rest of the whole round
2673412 i saw early on that he was playing way back on my first serve
2673413 im going to have to pressure him in the corners
2673414 he looks like hes 25 hes got a huge game
2673415 this was a nice week to build on it definitely turns the summer around
2673416 this is shocking because i thought the government had done a lot to ensure safety
2673417 i think this might hurt chinas image in the world but i dont think itll disturb the olympics per se
2673418 now i live four blocks on the other side of the parkway ive pretty much always been right here in the art museum area
2673419 stevie wonder bill withers marvin gaye i also dug the allman brothers and some other rock bands but i always leaned toward the soul side of things curtis mayfield and a lot of that 70s soul is what really resonated for me in a deep way and then some of the early 90s hip hop like a tribe called quest and the roots im kind of an amalgam of all those things
2673420 i enjoyed the performance aspect of getting in front of an audience
2673421 even though musical theater wasnt something i wanted to pursue that was where i first got the bug
2673422 i was dealing with rudimentary guitar skills what was good about that is that it connected me to focusing on the melody and the lyrics
2673423 once i finished school i set about going out to open mikes
2673424 id go to the point to the grape street pub the fire thats how i cut my teeth playing at open mikes
2673425 we hit it off we started talking about philly and he told me about all the different neighborhoods he lived in when he was starting out here
2673426 he also has a very sophisticated songwriting ability i think that hes going to be around for a long time
2673427 when i was a kid it gave me a world of trouble
2673428 but once i started doing music its such a bizarre unique name that i said im going to stick with this
2673429 its almost a strange built in marketing thing its always a conversation point ive been asked what is that did you make it up even when i tell people its my name sometimes they dont believe it but its unusual and its unique
2673430 there has been a lot of comment today regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2673431 this is not about questioning the managers judgement or the ability of a particular player
2673432 xabi alonso has been playing well which is positive for us we have a good player but hopefully we will have another good player coming too
2673433 chester county is ground zero in the battle for control of the state house
2673434 not only is pennsylvania the key state in the presidential election but chester county is the key to the keystone state
2673435 no doubt about it 2006 was the worst year for republicans since watergate
2673436 from what im hearing from new democrats the republican party no longer represents their values
2673437 they see light at the end of the tunnel after eight years of bush
2673438 two years ago for various reasons there certainly was almost a national stampede to vote against gop candidates of any office
2673439 today people are much more looking at individual races and candidates
2673440 this wont be a referendum on party or incumbent its going to be candidate driven
2673441 if you run the right candidates and adhere to the principles of low taxes and fiscal responsibility the voters will stay with you
2673442 thats why what happens here is a microcosm for what happens nationally
2673443 after inspecting the stadium in the indian capital on sunday afc decided to shift both the matches to ambedkar stadium now the final between hosts india and defending champions tajikistan will be played at 1900 hours preceded by the third place playoff between dpr korea and myanmar at 1600 hours
2673444 the shift in the venue was necessitated after incessant rains in hyderabad turned the ground unplayable
2673445 i feel im empowered im a sportswoman im getting stronger all the time and this is my uniform
2673446 i dont feel exploited at all hopefully were just encouraging people to be fit and healthy our lifestyle is so wonderful
2673447 the industry has faced a slowdown as domestic large and medium industries have commenced sourcing their inputs through cheaper imports
2673448 ssis have not been able to assure their old time vendors supplies at affordable rates because majority of them could not upgrade their machinery and equipment due to high cost of borrowings
2673449 ssis have been encountering a gloom period beginning first quarter of current fiscal as its contribution to manufacturing has come down to 35 percent compared to around 45 percent a few months ago
2673450 the number of ssi units in 2007 08 were estimated at 4 4 million with employment capacities for nearly 23 8 million workers with their output to manufacturing measured at rs 14 trillion 333 billion
2673451 as a result of deceleration that the ssi sector has been witnessing the number of units in ssis have come down to around 4 million by now and employment generation has shrunk to 22 5 million workers and their output to manufacturing has come down to rs 12 trillion
2673452 in the absence of any visible policy decisions their export potential which used to be between 40 45 percent for many years would decline by seven eight percent in current fiscal
2673453 expansion in most of ssi units have come to virtual halt and plugged employment opportunities the credit extension is very high cost and their delivery mechanism too is faulty with these impediments continue the ssis would find it extremely difficult to compete with their counterparts
2673454 i would fail in my duty if i need not comment on the manner in which deposition has been made by witness appearing for the government senior home ministry officials
2673455 it is equally sorry state of affairs when a senior officer of the central government appears before the tribunal to submit that he is not aware with regard to matters which are put to him
2673456 it is certainly no excuse to say that you were not posted in the department or were not designate responsible for the decision making appearing as a witness for the union government it becomes the duty and the responsibility of such officer to be fully aware of the matter with regard to which he is going to depose
2673457 it is shocking to know that for a minor re arrangement of some words for a few words at the end of the notification the notification of 2008 is almost a verbatim reproduction of the notification which was issued in 2006
2673458 with deep pain i would say that this is the most callous disregard of the statutory duty
2673459 even a single witness or a single case may be sufficient to support the claim of the government that an association is indulging in activities which is covered within the definition under the act
2673460 congress as the major party in the upa has to take a call on the leadership issue it should decide and discuss with the allies but if we want someone who is non controversial then manmohan singh is there
2673461 in the coming elections it is difficult for any party to get 160 170 seats
2673462 the conversion of hindus to islam happened over a period of time especially in the medieval period the people who embraced islam were not happy with hinduism which has a rigid system
2673463 this system made many people try to escape from it when opportunity arose across the country people from untouchable and other castes which faced discriminations became muslims in fact islam came as a big relief for them
2673464 about 98 per cent christians in andhra pradesh are from sc origin
2673465 the same backwardness is continuing till date that is why majority of muslims are poor
2673466 because we cannot publicly discuss our views about the library directors performance
2673467 in the case of jahmaurae allen we did not adhere to our own high standards
2673468 rioters hang another negro mobs in springfield ill defying 3 000 soldiers string up old and innocent victim
2673469 one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
2673470 it was a wonderful kind of artistic event and the twin towers provided the stage
2673471 i knew the story like many people who live in the city just as an anecdote that you collect or absorb by living here almost like a folk memory
2673472 and the fact that his life well philippe would say it wasnt at stake but everyone else knows that it was
2673473 one of the things that struck me as i made man on wire was that we were sort of re creating a new york that i wished still existed
2673474 its all caught up in the destruction of the twin towers ultimately
2673475 and in fact the new york of 1974 and the world trade center walk is a world id much rather live in i guess theres nostalgia about that which maybe is a dangerous emotion but nostalgia also has a kind of ache to it
2673476 it does bring back and evoke this city that we are in danger of losing completely
2673477 i felt that the choice of not engaging with the destruction of those buildings was essential
2673478 because everybodys going to be engaged with it anyway its the big fact the big documentary fact if you like its the defining fact perhaps
2673479 and the idea for me making the film was to get people not beyond it how could you but at least to a point where you could enjoy the towers being built and you could enjoy this sort of fantasy thats being projected onto them by this obsessed frenchman
2673480 you see the buildings really almost exclusively through his eyes in the film and that then becomes a legitimate way of bringing them back to life i think youre seeing them through someone who knew them knew their secrets and their secret noises because he spent so much time there as they were being finished as they were being built
2673481 if you told it as it was with the people involved you couldnt do any better than that
2673482 its a struggle to be a filmmaker in the u s and ive just given up on it now
2673483 its almost perverse to keep pretending im an american filmmaker
2673484 good i just dont like your driving brother terroir and next time dont leave your waypoints in the gps
2673485 we cant do the in fill until the person who created the work comes back into town
2673486 we discovered with an enduring shock that we can be right and still be defeated
2673487 tissue distribution and excretion patterns were consistent with those found after intravenous administration
2673488 the absorption of intact chondroitin sulfate is estimated to be anywhere from zero to thirteen percent
2673489 you can feed supplements containing chondroitin sulfate to horses at the recommended dose rate none will be absorbed

2673494 we zullen de wedstrijden tijdens de spelen nu met nog meer passie en vastberadenheid in gaan
2673495 terwijl het vuurwerk tijdens de openingsceremonie de lucht boven peking verlichtte gingen in diverse steden in georgi bommen en explosieven af we roepen de internationale gemeenschap op om rusland duidelijk te maken dat het invallen van een onafhankelijke staat in de 21e eeuw niet meer getolereerd kan worden
2673496 we hopen dat de duiven die vrijdag in het vogelnest werden losgelaten hun weg vinden naar de kaukasus en de vrede in het gebied herstellen
2673497 midvale october 12 2007 clinical studies conducted at the university of tennessee showed that seabuck complete added to your horses diet can aid in preventing gastric ulcers from increased severity during times of stress and should be considered as part of a daily ulcer preventative program
2673498 ive never seen a horse not develop ulcers after intermittent feeding
2673499 with depressed real estate values combined with a resurgence in norcal racing we feel the industry here has bottomed out and the time is right for this latest expansion
2673500 we had just enough to have a meal every evening
2673501 we were a musical family we would literally go out and sing for our supper and lunch
2673502 we would go to where the tourists were and my uncles played the ukuleles and sang and we girls danced we would earn enough money for lunch and hit it again
2673503 wed hunt seashells and wash them out and wed sell them to the tourists i dont know if they bought from us because of the shells or because we were so cute or pitiful but thats how we survived
2673504 well i didnt have any shells or palm leaves to play with anymore
2673505 we happened to be in a glass shop and i was admiring a glass pendant my husband told me that i could make it
2673506 you need a lot of people and a huge studio because the furnace is going all the time
2673507 i love the people here my husband and i traveled many states looking for a place to retire and we chose arkansas home is where you make it
2673508 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result

2673516 there was a report that the insurgents were meeting in the village and foreign soldiers surrounded the area
2673517 there was fighting in the village and then helicopters and fighter jets came
2673518 the village elders called me to say they were going to bury their dead and ask
2673519 right now the joint ceasefire committee is thrashing things out so the arrangement can push through but until that is thrashed out there will be tensions because the military is continuing to open fire
2673520 there is no halt in the shooting every hour there is continued fire of automatic rifles and something even more powerful probably a cannon
2673521 issues with the structure and scope of the new government are likely to take centre stage
2673522 it is understood that the negotiators have agreed on a number of issues that include land and sanctions while there are issues that they felt should be dealt with by the principals
2673523 the negotiators have reached common ground on the land issue sovereignty non interference freedom of assembly and association and sanctions
2673524 se me ratificam com mais de 54 vou convocar todas as autoridades ratificadas ou as novas autoridades para buscar consensos junto com movimentos sociais sejam sindicais ou c vicos para que o povo possa aprovar uma constitui o pol tica do estado boliviano que um tema pendente

2673534 playing at 12 oclock in the middle of the day is not fun
2673535 it was a sauna out there there was some head wind too so it wasnt easy
2673536 it feels like you have hot cream all over your body once you go full gas you cannot breathe
2673537 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would
2673538 to be honest i didnt really feel that great and then going into the ready room i started getting chills up my body right then and there i was starting to get more and more excited i mean i was pretty emotional after that race and im pretty excited to have that first one under my belt
2673539 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 after seeing everybody so close together
2673540 thats usually not how it as after the first 200 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point it was all adrenaline
2673541 i knew i had to go out fast in order to be in the race
2673542 if i was like a couple tenths slower on the backstroke i think i wouldve had a better shot i think that backstroke kind of took a lot out of me i did my best and i cant ask for anything else
2673543 i saw him after the race and he nodded and waved the american flag
2673544 its a pretty special feeling i waved and nodded my head back
2673545 anytime you get an opportunity to have a walk off game winning hit those are some of the most exciting moments in your career stuff that you dont forget
2673546 im sure most every player remembers every single one of their walk off hits it was special obviously being here and playing them
2673547 were not a power hitting club and weve got to execute
2673548 weve got to do little things but still you need the hits to win ballgames thats the brand of ball weve got to play
2673549 its a bit of a roller coaster of emotions for me just thinking about sitting behind the eight ball there and then just to see our guys battle out there off broxton its just huge
2673550 if you expect to do something special and play in october you just move on
2673551 one of the only reasons i might have been projected in the june draft where i was projected was because of the school i went to
2673552 i mean youve got a guy like atlantas marvin williams who comes out of north carolina and wins the championship coming off the bench and maybe averaging eight points
2673553 and hes a no 2 pick in 2005 i mean thats whats crazy to me
2673554 his feet were huge and he was so skinny it looked like his feet were barely keeping him upright but at the same time he was all over the court just playing hard and competing and talking to his teammates
2673555 jason probably wouldnt admit this but he was arguably the third best player on his high school team
2673556 but he was pretty relentless on the court hed go after every ball play every possession he was a kid that when you saw him play you couldnt wait to go see him again because he had just an infectious demeanor
2673557 we have a blonde friend in our party and the joke is that shes going to star in a lot of chinese families photo albums
2673558 its tragic i had to watch her cry outside of the stadium during that ceremony
2673559 obviously he was trying to make a play like you see brett favre make
2673560 its a high risk play and i would rather him not do that at this time
2673561 its all horrible hateful stuff but it carries with it so much history so much connection that you cant deny a twisted sort of familial lovingness is on some level behind it all
2673562 is heartbreaking because it carries with it the cumulative disappointment of losing or becoming estranged from everyone you know and love which andy has been doing over the whole movie but probably thought he could at least avoid happening with his own brother
2673563 well yep things seem to be going back to normal whoop de stinking doo
2673564 it was significant but i havent seen much but i know things changed but im not sure what it means yet and i cant believe its over yet but kind of glad it is
2673565 i learned more from that one class than any other
2673566 they are paying for books almost what i did to go to school
2673567 i dont know how viable the digital option is you cant pick it up and look at it
2673568 but in 10 or 15 years well laugh at this conversation
2673569 students are saying thats great if you make a reasonable priced alternative available ill buy that
2673570 theyll make as much or more money under our model
2673571 the people who are supposed to be served by it are totally dissatisfied
2673572 the only person that apart from dave scott ive met with a similar level understanding of mixing terrain skills and tactics

2673574 we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2673575 youre saying that the language itself is an act of violence
2673576 he who uses the sword shall perish by the sword
2673577 can all unite in our support for freedom of speech surely the pope is allowed to quote from medieval texts and of the press and we can also unite loudly in our condemnation of violent unprovoked attacks on churches embassies and elderly nuns

2673596 this sets a new standard and shows what the future of atlantic city can be
2673597 when people talk this place down we need to remind them about whats really up here in atlantic city the water club can stand proud with any resort property in the world
2673598 curtis vision to make atlantic city more than a gaming resort is the most exciting thing happening here bashaw is a class act and if he says the chelsea is hot hip and cool i believe him problem is i dont think im any of those terms but i still want to come
2673599 we wanted to create something that was not a buzzing hive like most casino hotels but quietly cosmopolitan that would really turn on what we call atlantic city rejecters
2673600 ice cold ice water ice cold iced tea ice cold ice cream
2673601 everyone acts as if nongaming is such a big idea that a hotel without slots in atlantic city is unheard of but this town was a world class resort for over a hundred years before gambling was introduced in the 1970s
2673602 if you stayed in atlantic city in the 1920s everything was cutting edge kentucky avenue was the jazz capital of the united states the best hotel bathrooms had four sets of taps for hot and cold water and hot and cold seawater we want to hearken back to that era but update it

2673604 they do not consider any kind of danger or harassment they have a religious ideology that considers any difficulty they face as a merit and mercy for their piety
2673605 it will take a few risk takers to invest in iraq but when that happens others should follow
2673606 were worried about reopening the museum in case a suicide bomber with an explosive vest infiltrates
2673607 we should wait until the spread of peace and security in the country
2673608 its turbulent and extreme domestic situation makes iraq one of the least desirable places in the world to be
2673609 my only income was depending on what tourists gave me for historical accessories or postcards and handmade copper goods
2673610 in the same breath that theyre said to be apolitical theyre said to be a celebration of human rights and theyre said to be a sporting festival we hope that can transcend mere sporting festivals
2673611 i think when we talk about the crisis in darfur we talk about the millions of innocent people that are suffering there and we talk about the positive role that china could play should they choose to and the rest of the international community i mean these people have been failed i think at every level
2673612 without any vote on whether or not the bond amount should be increased
2673613 the internal revenue service is also reviewing the tax exempt status of interest earned on a particular type of refunding bonds if the irs rescinds the tax exempt status of such bonds their market value would be reduced considerably
2673614 in our democracy we need to inform voters as much as possible

2673617 i will be out there to help her to get a better score i have always said that she is going to be my biggest competitor
2673618 it is where i was born my parents live there and i go back as often as i can and i will never not represent zimbabwe as long as im swimming
2673619 i guess when i stop swimming that is when ill stop representing zimbabwe
2673620 i can confirm the decision of georgias national olympic committee athletes and officials supported by their government that they will continue their participation at the olympic games here in beijing
2673621 that very much reflects the olympic spirit and values of the games
2673622 the ioc believes this is absolutely the right decision especially for the athletes for whom this is a once in a lifetime opportunity we have also been in touch with the russian olympic committee and they too have confirmed they wish to continue

2673627 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
2673628 but if you take all the chemistry thermal dymanics and theiries about carbon etc and take them down to basic priciples and back them up by the last hundred years of research and scientific findings then you update them with the mass of evidence from all of the recent studies if you do all this and you link to the studies the scientists and all of this is backed by facts the global warming hoax people
2673629 i dont see how dying polarbears has to do with politics or even america
2673630 this gives us time to review their research and see if theres any validity to it and if in fact we need to take any corrective action
2673631 if what the mit undergrads claim in their public announcements is true public disclosure of the security flaws before the mbta and its system vendors have an opportunity to correct the flaws will cause significant damage to the mbtas transit system
2673632 we initially called them the t to offer them our help in fixing these vulnerabilities
2673633 we have no intention of releasing details that would allow someone to replicate the attacks that can be done
2673634 i just feel that the mayor came into office with a lot of promise a lot of potential some very unique gifts to help detroit be better
2673635 i think that what we have over the city now is this abyss of darkness that prevents us from moving forward and so i think the time has come for the mayor to resign
2673636 i believe that there comes a time when we as religious leaders have to speak with our prophetic voice even to powers that be and say what needs to be said
2673637 i think that the private conversations that people are having right now are all about a quick resolution or an expeditious resolution of this situation there are sentiments on both sides but i think that everybody wants this to be over
2673638 this has been a tough summer funerals of young people whose blood is being spilled in this city nonsensically and i just believe that there are other issues right now that are not getting any attention
2673639 we have an imploding educational system that is rife with corruption it appears
2673640 we have a brutal economy that is ravaging our region we have middle class families who have left the city and many who have left the state looking for greater opportunities
2673641 its hard to get things done these days its hard for people to get together and talk about anything
2673642 a lot of ministers have been preaching messages that revolve around themes of hope in the middle of despair
2673643 it shows wisdom for people not to be so reactive to everything
2673644 theyre not at everyones beck and call as to how and when they react i think it is wise to understand human frailty and to understand that people make mistakes so when you look at it from a spiritual standpoint the elements of forgiveness are always there
2673645 but youve got to love us enough to know when youre hurting us and right now were hurting our visible and conversational image worldwide has just reached an all time low and this has to stop i believe that the city is in gods hands and that we will survive
2673646 if you accept the creation story which i preach then you know that god always forms things out of chaos
2673647 its just going to be a long day obviously the guys that finished saturday that played well will have a nice relaxing morning while were out there grinding its going to be tough for us but it can be done
2673648 its going to be like college again playing 36 in one day
2673649 it happens everybody else is going to do it too so you just have to go out there and deal with it
2673650 were confident that we can effectively accommodate our objectives in completing the third round sunday morning
2673651 and not compromise setting up the proper conditions for the championship fourth round later in the afternoon
2673652 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
2673653 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2673654 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2673655 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2673656 i think theres an unusual split in the group we havent seen in the past
2673657 exactly because funding va programs commands bipartisan support some in the congress like to attach unrelated pork barrel appropriations and earmarks to va bills
2673658 the result is to mix vital national priorities with wasteful and often worthless political pork
2673659 let me make very clear this card is not intended to either replace the va or privatize veterans healthcare as some have wrongly charged
2673660 out into the local economy in hope that someone can take care of their combat wounds its essentially privatization something i cannot support
2673661 well have a simple principle for veterans sleeping on our streets zero tolerance
2673662 could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
2673663 would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2673664 its really sad after the celebration of the opening ceremonies which were the best opening ceremonies ive ever been at
2673665 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2673666 the only comfort is that wiz was not injured in the heinous attack
2673667 two of the most supportive and friendly people that i have ever encountered they love the sport and are beloved in the volleyball community
2673668 all through his life he wanted to be a firefighter
2673669 matt hammer was special matt called me he was at a seminary school and said he wanted a job typically i want to meet someone before we hire them i want to look at their hands see if they can work
2673670 but as i talked to matt i made him an offer right there there was just something about him one of his callings was an evangelist minister i always had him do a morning prayer before we went on to a fire he wasnt maybe the greatest preacher but everything he said came from the heart
2673671 i can pretty much tell you exactly what they were feeling when they boarded
2673672 they would have been excited we all love to fly in helicopters
2673673 you run into the attitude oh you are just another contractor

2673723 this spring in the immediate fashion future its all about a clutch a hand held satchel and a shoe that has the same essence
2673724 for example well see spectator shoes with a great red bag or a camel pump with a brown structured bag everything is getting a bit more fussy
2673725 well be seeing white and bone bags with sharp pumps there wont be so much boldness as there was before
2673726 many companies are getting into categories that just didnt exist before giving people more choices and more options the shoe and bag combo is going back to the old roots
2673727 instead we are going to see accessories like pearls and diamonds and great gold jewelry accented in shoes and bags

2673743 keep in mind these guys were bringing in here are primarily here to respond to something bad
2673744 theyre here to respond to a terrorist attack hopefully they come out see the rocky mountains and go home that would be the best scenario in my view
2673745 when things blow up because the police have to enforce a permit that the democrats got dont blame us for that
2673746 were not going to give up civic center park to the democrats they are creating a very dangerous situation

2673749 conversational health is a very therapeutic process for many people normalizing someones experience can help add years to their life
2673750 the process is made even more effective when groups like boomers who are at similar life stages share thoughts feelings and information
2673751 proactive health is important to boomers who stand to live 20 years longer on average than their grandparents did
2673752 in addition to diseases or health conditions that have already occurred boomers are sharing tips on healthy living from losing weight to exercise to a vegetarian way of life
2673753 ive had fibromyalgia for over 25 years and while i have very supportive friends and family its difficult for them to understand what its like for me to live with this little known disease
2673754 thanks to the incredible fibromyalgia community on eons com i finally have friends who get it we all strive to be supportive of each other laugh with each other and when appropriate gently scold or nudge each other into taking better care of ourselves this group has changed the way i see and live my life with fibromyalgia
2673755 anytime people need to stretch dollars they use their public libraries
2673756 i think were going to see evidence of that i hope those who have discovered the library will become advocates if theyre threatened
2673757 it was good to get back in the flow a few good throws a few not so good
2673758 now well see what we can do to get better
2673759 all i wanted to do was be in a group thats where i felt comfortable
2673760 computer magazine tells of pcs genesis right here in s a
2673761 reminiscent of western towns that mushroomed almost overnight during the days of the gold rush rotterdam junction was transformed from a placid farmland region into a flourishing hustling village when singled out as the ideal location for a rail shipment center
2673762 gone were the hum of rolling box cars the din of drawbar striking drawbar the snorting of yard dogs and all the familiar clamor which for half a century had been an integral part of the communitys life
2673763 this is part of our community that means a lot to me
2673764 thats a burden that is going to be shared by only a few folks
2673765 theyre a fair ways away and it does take a while to get out here
2673766 unfortunately living a little more rurally obviously its going to take a bit longer
2673767 so many people are fed up with todays options for girls and the short window for girlhood
2673768 they are looking to the past for role models and stories but in a future oriented way
2673769 it was a very very very different life than mine
2673770 she got to ride horses she had a mom and dad that stayed at the house more often and sisters that werent really mean to her
2673771 there was a little doll made of corn or something
2673772 this was her first musical and i grew up watching melissa gilbert so i was very excited to come see her
2673773 our set of books were passed from my mother to me to my daughter to josie so four generations
2673774 its just a fabulous story a good family story its good for every age
2673775 i like learning how it relates to real life and things about the past
2673776 it feels like im always there especially here in the play it just kind of feels like im there
2673777 girls do have wiis nintendo at 9 i wanted a canopy bed and a pony my daughter wants an iphone this is the world our girls live in there is more of a challenge more media more culture to assimilate and tease out and so much of it is very appealing
2673778 theres something to be said about pastimes that girls have always had to remember some of that too its nice that sometimes they can have very solitary creative pursuits without having to blog about it
2673779 for a girl to be earnest about what she likes to speak up it is kind of daring to include a recipe in a book for girls when we know so much about how girls are limited its daring to reclaim these things this everyday daring like raising your hand in class
2673780 doesnt have to choose to be sparkly or daring she can be both she can be a budding technology geek who also plays soccer the world is a big place
2673781 theyre always running late they never go to the doctor and theyre great excuse makers
2673782 you send these people to a course and theyll say thats very interesting but that doesnt apply to me i call it the but however factor
2673783 people email me at least every couple of weeks they say youve described me my relationship has fallen apart i didnt get my promotion i lost my job its very debilitating
2673784 one of our key aims is to keep the festival solvent at the lowest possible ticket price
2673785 if i was company minded i would have hired a huge hall and charged 50 a ticket for sean connery but that is not our ethos
2673786 instead it is an intimate venue at 9 for each seat its a point of principle but i am effortlessly denying us income
2673787 it is my passion to make this the most international illuminating engaging argumentative and inspiring celebration of words and ideas anywhere in the world
2673788 georgina kan zoiets maar moeilijk uiten en heeft op deze wijze de confrontatie gezocht
2673789 ze zocht waarschijnlijk avontuur afwisseling toen ik begreep dat ze met jort in de polder woonde dacht ik al die houdt het daar niet vol
2673790 ineens was ze iemand had ze fans die om een handtekening vroegen

2673797 yeah they offered me the role but its not really what i see for myself

2673804 the uacs goal in this project is to raise awareness because most people have no idea what sharia law is
2673805 we are confident people will see the billboard and learn on their own what sharia law is and come to their own conclusions at the very least we hope our billboard will spark public debate on this overlooked issue
2673806 usually i listen to what theyre saying because theyre already emotional to begin with
2673807 i dont buy what theyre saying these people are not standing up like they should against these radical islamic terrorists
2673808 after they slow down we go about explaining to them in the context suicide is forbidden by islam and killing innocent people is forbidden
2673809 we recite them words from the quran that say that muslims should not be judged by the actions of a few people just like christians and jews should not be judged by actions of a few
2673810 i will be out there to help her to get a better score i have always said that she is going to be my biggest competitor
2673811 the policeman involved in the kidnapping was close to this family they tried to kill them the girls to prevent them from telling the truth

2673820 i feel as if i have got a better swim in me but i did everything i could i will be a bit more ready to go when the 1 500 comes around
2673821 it is where i was born my parents live there and i go back as often as i can and i will never not represent zimbabwe as long as im swimming
2673822 i guess when i stop swimming that is when ill stop representing zimbabwe
2673823 your olympic victory is a giant glory to the entire nation you elevated the morale of the entire nation congratulations

2673830 we are not going to worry about our opponent in the next round
2673831 we will try to win our next match to finish first in the group and if we have to face the united states thats ok
2673832 i think they still have their feelings hurt because of that match
2673833 but now i will have to be extra careful in the next match to keep from hurting our team in the quarterfinals

2673838 der mann spricht bodenst ndigen dialekt ist korpulent 170 bis 180 cm gro tr gt dunkles kurzes haar und einen oberlippenbart
2673839 es ist eine v llig neue erfahrung f r mich nat rlich bemerkt man dann beim spielen gewisse sprachliche ausdr cke die nur der sascha verwendet
2673840 ich habe mir oft berlegt was ich tun w rde h tte ich im echten leben dieses los gezogen vielleicht parf m verkaufen
2673841 ich m chte in den n chsten jahren etwas neues ausprobieren
2673842 meiner meinung nach war das mein letztes rennen ber 400 m lagen
2673843 ich habe ihm gesagt dass es mein letzter 400er w re
2673844 und er hat gesagt dass ich dann mit einem weltrekord abschlie en m sse
2673845 dass wir es schwer haben w rden sie zu toppen
2673846 besonders wenn man bedenkt unter welchen umst nden rund um ihn er das geschafft hat
2673847 so ein lauf ist dann schon etwas spezielles michael macht aber nie riesenspr nge sondern immer einen schritt nach dem anderen
2673848 er war ein bisschen angespannt aber das ist auch klar wenn der pr sident der vereinigten staaten auf der trib ne sitzt
2673849 immer wenn du glaubst du kommst an ihn heran st t er in eine neue ebene vor
2673850 as the most heavily forested state in the nation we know that maine people are turning to firewood this season to fight record high energy prices
2673851 for those who are new or returning to burning wood we want you to be safe and know how to burn wood properly
2673852 taking the step of burning firewood to offset some of the cost of oil is a smart one as long as you do it with safety as your first priority
2673853 together we can work to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and move toward a more secure energy future
2673854 historically the town has awarded the bid based on who has the lower price per ton
2673855 however theres another little problem the bids have exceeded how much money we have
2673856 ah screw the practices lets deal with the real thing instead
2673857 they did come and see me and did ring me up
2673858 i said to them wheres the fraud and they said to me they dont know yet
2673859 im certainly not going to make any allegations of that
2673860 we must wipe this stain from our political landscape we must get to the bottom of the secret funding deals so long denied for which explanations have been promised but never given
2673861 there was a report that the insurgents were meeting in the village and foreign soldiers surrounded the area
2673862 there was fighting in the village and then helicopters and fighter jets came
2673863 the village elders called me to say they were going to bury their dead and ask nato not to bomb
2673864 wird der patient zu teuer ladet man ihn irgendwo ab vor einer obdachlosenunterkunft
2673865 im not sure that amy has the proper image that ben amp jerrys wants to be connected with
2673866 theres this perfectly nice allegedly a 14 year old girl looks to be about 60
2673867 im surprised that he lowered himself to pick on a child and act like a child himself
2673868 yeah they offered me the role but its not really what i see for myself
2673869 there are at least six other famous women pregnant right now who arent getting picked on
2673870 wie wir die doofen menschen dazu bewegen uns bedingungslos zu glauben dass das geld die brunnen der erde vergiftet
2673871 wie das j dische finanzkapital den deutschen arbeiter zu grunde richtet
2673872 warum das geld schuld daran tr gt dass fabian hamb chen keine gold medaille gewinnen konnte
2673873 das geld der einzige verantwortliche f r den klimawandel und all seine folgen
2673874 ahora venimos nosotros somos muchos y poderosos somos capitalistas de mercado y somos comunistas somos autoritarios somos agresivos en menos de diez a os dominaremos la econom a mundial
2673875 qu pasar a si un d a todos los chinos a la vez dieran una patada en el suelo
2673876 la china y la india se hallan por decirlo as fuera de la historia universal ni en la china ni en la india hay progreso tr nsito a otra cosa desde que el mundo existe estos imperios s lo han sabido desenvolverse dentro de s son los primeros y a la vez los inm viles
2673877 abatieron la autoridad del emperador y obligaron al celeste imperio a entrar en contacto con el mundo terrenal el aislamiento total era la condici n fundamental para la preservaci n de la antigua china como tal aislamiento tuvo un fin violento por intermedio de inglaterra la disgregaci n era tan inevitable como la que espera a una momia cuidadosamente conservada en un ata d herm tico cuando entra en contacto con el aire
2673878 i think we were too young to realize we werent supposed to be winning games
2673879 the fans adore the athletes who play in this city i never found that anywhere else maybe its because it was my first stop but i dont think so
2673880 it was like all right my stuff really does work
2673881 to steal a line from top gun i needed to have my hair on fire
2673882 i wasnt awake until i put myself in a tough spot
2673883 right now im getting the opportunity to play and thats all i wanted
2673884 its hard to develop any consistency when youre not playing every day
2673885 ive told him you have a place of value if you accept what it is
2673886 we have within the modern period very many examples which enable us to study the evolution of legendary miracles
2673887 during his career as a missionary he wrote great numbers of letters which were preserved and have since been published and these with the letters of his contemporaries exhibit clearly all the features of his life his own writings are very minute and enable us to follow him fully
2673888 for example in the beginning of his career during a journey in europe with an ambassador one of the servants in fording a stream got into deep water and was in danger of drowning xavier tells us that the ambassador prayed very earnestly and that the man finally struggled out of the stream
2673889 but on the same page with this tribute to the great missionary acosta goes on to discuss the reasons why progress in the worlds conversion is not so rapid as in the early apostolic times and says that an especial cause why apostolic preaching could no longer produce apostolic results lies in the missionaries themselves because there is now no power of working miracles
2673890 es lindo ganar una final y m s a brasil

2673894 those games were probably as good as weve played all year because we got contributions from a lot of people

2673907 rusia ha lanzado una invasi n militar a gran escala en georgia
2673908 el presidente insisti en que la nica salida para esta crisis provocada por las autoridades georgianas es una retirada de las tropas comandadas por tiflis de la zona de conflicto
2673909 la aspiraci n de los georgianos de ingresar a la otan es en realidad un intento para sumar m s pa ses y m s pueblos a sus sangrientas aventuras en osetia del sur
2673910 votar las retenciones al agro y sumarse a generar un clima de inestabilidad social
2673911 ganar un espacio de participaci n gremial ante la problem tica del campo laboral
2673912 la ofensiva guerrillera quer a apurar los tiempos ya hab an logrado junto a la c pula militar derrotar al gobierno elegido por el pueblo
2673913 mienten cuando dicen que hubo 30 000 desaparecidos no hubo 30 000 ni fueron desaparecidos los desaparecidos son un invento argentino
2673914 hay desaparecidos como la doctora carmen argibay molina que apareci y figuraba como desaparecida
2673915 apropol naci como un sindicato que llev adelante peleas importantes en el campo gremial y que denunci la corrupci n de altos oficiales de la polic a provincial como en el caso del robo de nafta
2673916 las coincidencias puntuales con adepol en la sindicalizaci n de los efectivos policiales o en la elecci n de los comisarios pero s lo eso
2673917 llamamos a no intervenir en conflictos sociales ni gremiales y a no enfrentarnos entre laburantes enfrentarnos entre trabajadores es lo que le conviene al gobierno quedando bien en claro que si los de abajo no nos unimos para enfrentar a los de arriba patronal gobierno jueces y c pula policial ellos nos dividen para reventarnos a todos
2673918 hay 10 polic as provinciales sindicalizadas en upcn con lo que se ahorran tener que mandar servicios a las asambleas y reuniones porque ya est n adentro

2673923 no creo que nuestro ej rcito nacional se someta a la servidumbre de un totalitarismo
2673924 tengo la seguridad de que la gente va a reconocer mis obras y voy a ser ratificado si acaso no se consuma el gran fraude por parte del mas pero eso s pase lo que pase no voy a renunciar y voy a seguir al frente de la prefectura hasta concluir el mandato nadie me va sacar ni voy abandonar la lucha legal y leg tima

2673934 hab a cientos de centros operaban m s de 20 en tucum n y cada fuerza de tarea montaba su propio lugar de detenci n de personas para la simple identificaci n de los antecedentes de las personas sospechosas o sorprendidas en su colaboraci n con el accionar subversivo
2673935 equipos especiales remitidos peri dicamente por el comandante en jefe del ej rcito hac an los interrogatorios de pr ctica
2673936 la figura del desaparecido es un arbitrio del accionar psicol gico de la subversi n para disimular sus bajas en combate
2673937 las fuerzas rotaban cada 45 d as y operaban en distintos lugares utilizando diferentes infraestructuras generalmente p blicas comisar as escuelas etc tera para la interrogaci n previa de personas detenidas
2673938 el a o que viene necesitamos un buen triunfo para consolidarnos

2673954 cuando estaba caminando de vuelta escuch el ruido de las turbinas de los jets

2673968 en un d a de trabajo los cartoneros recuperan en la ciudad 600 toneladas
2673969 si se estima que cada generador puede producir por d a un promedio de 50 kilos de reciclables tenemos que se generan 75 toneladas por d a
2673970 de cada 30 contenedores tapa naranja transportados a los centros verdes 25 son rechazados por no contener residuos recuperables
2673971 pusieron los contenedores antes de que la gente sepa c mo usarlos

2674051 am anfang war er nicht so begeistert er hatte schon abgeschlossen mit dem kapitel aber er ist einer wenn er dann wieder auf der matte ist als k mpfer oder trainer dann packt ihn das fieber wieder und ich war sehr froh dar ber dass wir die entscheidung durchgezogen haben
2674052 aber jetzt mit der medaille um den hals war es richtig
2674053 ich bin keiner der sich mit der medaille schlafen legt eine medaille ist optisch sch n innerlich z hlt f r mich die leistung die ich gebracht habe die goldmedaille bei der em war eine katastrophe aber wie sie ausschaut ist dem sportler egal wichtig ist dass man das ziel erreicht hat
2674054 jein ich f hle irgendwie dass ich schon sehr viel erreicht habe
2674055 an dem tag an dem ich nicht mehr gewinnen will h re ich sofort auf
2674056 sie war mit jemandem zusammen der sie nicht gut behandelt hat
2674057 die wertberichtigung der beteiligung an dem kreditportfolio ist aus sicht des vorstands und des aufsichtsrates eine schmerzhafte aber notwendige bereinigung wir sind davon berzeugt dass uns dieser schritt und das starke operative gesch ft in die lage versetzt in den kommenden jahren wieder die volle ertragsst rke der hci gruppe zum tragen zu bringen
2674058 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2674059 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2674060 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
2674061 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2674062 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2674063 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2674064 we realize that there is more to life than distraction
2674065 its like an old married couple on the porch rocking
2674066 the story of a man who never refused to offer help when he is asked and who when he contracted cancer continues working
2674067 hope you feel better how is this for future pioneer square
2674068 un caine a venit m a mushcat si a fugit venitzi cu noi sa dam in caine cun pietroi
2674069 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2674070 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2674071 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2674075 women dont really want sex so men have to persuade coerce them
2674076 chester county is ground zero in the battle for control of the state house
2674077 not only is pennsylvania the key state in the presidential election but chester county is the key to the keystone state
2674078 no doubt about it 2006 was the worst year for republicans since watergate
2674079 from what im hearing from new democrats the republican party no longer represents their values
2674080 they see light at the end of the tunnel after eight years of bush
2674081 two years ago for various reasons there certainly was almost a national stampede to vote against gop candidates of any office
2674082 today people are much more looking at individual races and candidates
2674083 this wont be a referendum on party or incumbent its going to be candidate driven
2674084 if you run the right candidates and adhere to the principles of low taxes and fiscal responsibility the voters will stay with you
2674085 thats why what happens here is a microcosm for what happens nationally
2674086 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2674087 i couldnt believe that i actually felt better not fantastic but better
2674088 and i wanted to know why and i wanted to help others
2674089 someone said to me why are you sitting through all this testimony and i said i dont want to be surprised by anything in traumatic grief thats when your stomach does a flip when you get an intense headache and when you want to go to bed for three days
2674090 well there is no law that says i have to but thats my son aaron whos going to stand for him
2674091 ive gone back and forth in my mind on the death penalty
2674092 if i were the state could i give a lethal injection
2674093 probably not if i had the chance to stop what happened any mother would rip the face off that person but can i do it after the fact im not sure
2674094 im going to say 1 youll say 2 ill say 3 then youll say 1 ill say 2 and youll say 3
2674095 weve ramped up the enforcement efforts were going to continue to do so
2674096 everything we do is the result of a lengthy investigation
2674097 these are not naughty postcards from the beach they are undoubtedly porn pure and simple some of it is quite dark with animals committing fellatio and girl on girl action its quite unpleasant
2674098 the kafka industry doesnt want to know such things about its idol
2674099 getting them back was like making a big deal without losing anybody
2674100 in the past id have said a lot of guys would be gone but with them signing hanley to a long term deal it shows theyre willing to make an effort but i dont know who else theyd do that with nothing is for certain nobody knows who if anybody will be gone
2674101 right now weve put ourselves in a position to win the division and we cant worry about anything else
2674102 im not sure that amy has the proper image that ben amp jerrys wants to be connected with
2674103 theres this perfectly nice allegedly a 14 year old girl looks to be about 60
2674104 im surprised that he lowered himself to pick on a child and act like a child himself
2674105 yeah they offered me the role but its not really what i see for myself
2674106 there are at least six other famous women pregnant right now who arent getting picked on
2674107 in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world
2674108 dont worry before the tribulation comes you will be translated raptured
2674109 hey i can use that in the time of tribulation
2674110 will this one i am sitting beside be the next one killed will i be the next one
2674111 no daddy you give me the money for the ticket just before we get on the train
2674112 they knew full well that she had no access to her journalistic work product after they abruptly terminated her
2674113 were going to play on everything good that people know about wysp
2674114 nbc15 will allow me more creativity than i had in philadelphia
2674115 why didnt they wake up when they had a chance
2674116 the earth is having more and more problem now and it is starting being so unstable why we wan to giv birth kids and let them suffer let them suffer the pain we brought
2674117 les cinq derniers mois ont t la pire p riode de ma vie
2674118 perhaps unsurprisingly in the face of so many adverse surprises the policy debate has become cacophonous some emphasise the necessity of the painful adjustments under way while others urge their mitigation some focus on product price inflation others on asset price deflation as the principal problem some focus on assuring that imprudent lending by financial institutions is discouraged others on assuring that financing for investment by households and businesses remains available some focus on slowing market adjustments to prevent panic others on the need for rapid adjustment of prices to true fundamental levels even if this is painful in the short run
2674119 when youre in your casket and friends and congregation members are mourning over you what would you like them to say
2674120 the filmmakers gave themselves a nice evenly exposed neg to provide the most latitude in post this shooting philosophy applies even more with video where noise and compression artifacts lurk in shadows and are just waiting for color correction to bring them out of hiding

2674125 when youre listening to love songs its like a song to
2674126 hey cool i like secondhand serenade but how did that song go again
2674127 what is the most important thing that which we need more than anything else it is not money power or knowledge it is true love true love is more precious than life itself and more important to us than air or water
2674128 when we examine the universe we see that all beings exist in pairs relating to one another as subject and object in the mineral world we observe the relationship of plus and minus in the plant world the animal world and the world of human beings we see the relationship between masculine and feminine this is because god created the universe in order to fulfill the expression of love all beings desire the experience of true love through a mutual relationship love is the one power in the universe that absolutely no one can possess by himself once we have a partner however love gives us the power to share the entire universe likewise a husband and wife need children in order to experience the profound joy of parental love

2674134 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2674135 the absence of our great poet mahmud darwish the love of palestine and the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2674136 darwish is the essential breath of the palestinian people the eloquent witness of exile and belonging
2674137 by drilling in the santa barbara channel we could help clean up our tar stained beaches
2674138 if we were to drill and take the pressure off we would have more oil more taxes paid and cleaner beaches
2674139 you took advantage of her she was vulnerable and you were in a position of trust as a taxi driver

2674144 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2674145 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2674146 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2674147 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2674148 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2674149 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them
2674150 obviously it turns a defining element of his biography his reputation as a devoted family man upside down
2674151 but if he shows a continued commitment to his core issues and no additional facts emerge that contradict his story he could eventually join the disturbingly large club of public figures whove rebounded from similar events
2674152 the sisterhood of the traveling pants 2 opened in u s theaters as the latest example of a girl oriented film that hopes to become a breakout hit at box offices it tells of the friendship of four college age women
2674153 in the u s box office driven industry if you want to do a smaller personal film you have to find your own financing
2674154 my understanding is that my client believes she is in compliance with the agreement
2674155 i think wed love to see it be zero but puppies are like babies and at times can get sick
2674156 thats why we have a puppy lemon law and thats why we support it
2674157 clearly there is no follow up and the consent decree is meaningless
2674158 we tried to put them out of business in 1997 but the court ruled against us
2674159 if there are violations of the consent petition we will file a contempt petition and ask the court to provide sanctions and if we have the grounds to shut them down we will ask the court to do so
2674160 the only thing that is acceptable to our family is that you have the kennel shut down
2674161 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2674162 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2674163 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2674164 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2674165 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2674166 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2674167 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2674168 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2674169 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2674170 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2674171 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2674172 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2674173 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2674174 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2674175 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2674176 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2674177 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2674178 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2674179 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2674180 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2674181 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2674182 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2674183 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2674184 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2674185 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2674186 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2674187 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2674188 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2674189 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2674190 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2674191 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2674192 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2674193 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2674194 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2674195 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2674196 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2674197 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2674198 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2674199 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2674200 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2674201 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2674202 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2674203 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2674204 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2674205 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2674206 in the college game you have to plan a little more strategy
2674207 weve had a lot of good girls come through here
2674208 at this level if i can prepare them then thats how i challenge myself
2674209 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2674210 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2674211 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2674212 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2674213 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2674214 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2674215 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2674216 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2674217 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2674218 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2674219 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2674220 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2674221 a new book by author ron suskind claims that the white house bush ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
2674222 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
2674223 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
2674224 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
2674225 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
2674226 suskind writes in his new book that the order to create the letter was written on creamy white house stationery the book suggests that the letter was subsequently created by the cia and delivered to iraq the author claims that such an operation part of false pretenses for war would apparently constitute illegal white house use of the cia to influence a domestic audience an arguably impeachable offense
2674227 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2674228 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2674229 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2674230 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2674231 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2674232 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2674233 britain needs a bill of rights to protect the liberty of the individual
2674234 we recommend for inclusion amongst others the right to trial by jury the right to administrative justice and international human rights as yet not incorporated into uk law
2674235 we believe that there is a strong case for detailed rights for children and we recommend that the public should be consulted about including specific rights for other vulnerable groups
2674236 im gonna go talk loudly to myself about the one world government freedom as america collapses us government secret plans revealed
2674237 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2674238 ill be training every faculty member from custodians to bus drivers to board members and superintendents on how to use them
2674239 weve never had to use it thank the lord i am tickled to death to be receiving two more you cant mess up with these it will either tell to shock them or not to shock them
2674240 before long theyre going to be everywhere and it is a huge advantage if you know how to use one
2674241 most people dont realize that children can go into cardiac arrest just like adults i hope the aeds stay in a box and never have to be used but it provides a sense security to know that we now have them
2674242 tunics and denim jeans t shirts and denim jeans screened tees and denim jeans thats whats in for girls this fall
2674243 denim is again popular for fall but were seeing some rising star companies offering jeans for a little less money than some
2674244 theyre wearing jeans with high heels and boots were seeing tons of boots for fall and winter
2674245 theyre starting to dress up more too they can wear a nice dress shirt a loose tie and a jacket but it isnt what your dad or granddad wore
2674246 theres not so much of the baggy look and theyre wearing fitted t shirts too
2674247 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2674248 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2674249 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2674250 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2674251 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2674252 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2674253 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2674254 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2674255 who are open to doing something on the production side
2674256 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2674257 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2674258 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2674259 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2674260 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2674261 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2674262 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2674263 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2674264 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2674265 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2674266 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2674267 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2674268 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2674269 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2674270 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2674271 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2674272 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2674273 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2674274 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2674275 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2674276 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2674277 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2674278 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2674279 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

2674281 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2674282 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2674283 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2674284 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2674285 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2674286 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2674287 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2674288 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2674289 its hard to believe how big the salmon are up here right now
2674290 seriously the average salmon at rivers inlet is 40 pounds and up and theres 50 60 and 70 pounders
2674291 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2674292 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2674293 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2674294 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2674295 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2674296 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2674297 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2674298 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2674299 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2674300 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2674301 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2674302 they have left handed or other special scissors to help kids master cutting
2674303 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2674304 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2674305 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2674306 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2674307 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2674308 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2674309 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2674310 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2674311 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2674312 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2674313 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

2674317 what was going through my mind the whole time i got show was am i going to be able to play football again
2674318 when the doctors came in and told me im a very lucky young man i didnt tell them i was lucky i told them i was blessed
2674319 i dont feel any kind of way toward the guys about it
2674320 i just pray to god about the situation and pray for those guys
2674321 trent was probably four inches away from where that bullet hit of not being here right now

2674336 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2674337 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2674338 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2674339 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2674340 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2674341 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2674342 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2674343 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2674344 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2674345 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2674346 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2674347 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2674348 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2674349 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2674350 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2674351 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2674352 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2674353 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2674354 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2674355 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

2674473 weve had that communication gap a lot of times and this will help to bridge that gap between the communities and understand that they can communicate with the police and will have a liaison its vitally important
2674474 i want to have a long career here im 41 im not here to just try out what its like im here to stay for a long time and retire from here
2674475 it sounds like some marylanders are going to get a free ride at the expense of others
2674476 oh come on were going to be putting in more mass transit that doesnt even begin to pay for itself
2674477 i want to make sure we continue to improve the intersections of route 32
2674478 my focus is on treading the appropriate balance between roads and mass transit
2674479 clearly we need to continue to offer roads to get people where theyre going but we also need multimodal transit
2674480 ive always believed mass transit is the way to save traffic congestion on the roads
2674481 some people feel we can build our way out of this by building more roads but thats a shortsighted focus
2674482 the bottom line in all this is the public wants options
2674483 we see it from the petitions we get they want a transit system that works especially in the baltimore region
2674484 i dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite
2674485 how awesome are your deeds because of your great strength your enemies cringe before you all the earth bows down before you sings to you sings out your name
2674486 you shall not inherit anything in our fathers house for you are the son of another woman
2674487 come and be our commander so that we may fight with the ammonites
2674488 are you not the very ones who rejected me and drove me out of my fathers house so why do you come to me now when you are in trouble
2674489 nevertheless we have now turned back to you so that you may go with us and fight with the ammonites and become head over us over all the inhabitants of gilead
2674490 if you bring me home again to fight with the ammonites and the lord gives them over to me i will be your head
2674491 the lord will be witness between us we will surely do as you say
2674492 if you will give the ammonites into my hand then whoever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when i return victorious from the ammonites shall be the lords to be offered up by me as a burnt offering
2674493 alas my daughter you have brought me very low you have become the cause of great trouble to me for i have opened my mouth to the lord and i cannot take back my vow
2674494 my father if you have opened your mouth to the lord do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth now that the lord has given you vengeance against your enemies the ammonites
2674495 let this thing be done for me grant me two months so that i may go and wander on the mountains and bewail my virginity my companions and i
2674496 the intent is to provide affordability for the citizens of howard county it rounds out the availability of products for folks
2674497 one reason to extend the period was to allow us to do some more advertising
2674498 you could have your 85 year old mother living with you and youre 65
2674499 thats an awful lot of square footage for older people whose children have probably moved on it just doesnt make good sense to me
2674500 sony ericsson wanted to make sure our first hsdpa handset was the perfect combination of style and function as all know hsdpa is a big leap forward in the speed of mobile functionality but as always sony ericsson does not deliver technology for its own sake
2674501 we believe the z750 is such a compelling offer because not only will it be one of the best looking clamshells on the market but it also provides the tools or applications which really let you get the most from these broadband speeds
2674502 sony ericsson is continuing to deliver on the promise of the marriage of sony and ericsson with iconic products such as the z750 says najmi jarwala president sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc there is no question that hsdpa is critical for north american gsm operators and we believe products like the z750 will entice the mass market to tap into everything these faster networks enable consumers to do while on the move
2674503 we wont compromise on safety we might compromise convenience and comfort but we will not compromise safety
2674504 we guarantee the drivers so many hours a day they are getting paid more they are happy with that
2674505 we still need bus drivers its not as critical as it was but its still a need
2674506 we have a good group of drivers most of them are returning to the same route were maybe luckier than the other companies but were always looking for good drivers
2674507 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen

2674510 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her privacy now or in the future
2674511 happy to take a paternity test would love to see it happen
2674512 we support full inclusion of gay and lesbian families in the life of our nation and seek equal responsibilities benefits and protections for these families in our country marriage has been defined at the state level for 200 years and we believe it should continue to be defined there we repudiate president bushs divisive effort to politicize the constitution by pursuing a federal marriage amendment our goal is to bring americans together not drive them apart
2674513 we support the full inclusion of all families in the life of our nation and support equal responsibility benefits and protections we will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non discrimination act we oppose the defense of marriage act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us
2674514 no one can love the filipinos better than the filipinos themselves
2674515 then it remains for our supreme court to decide the matter with true integrity and the utmost fidelity to constitutional precepts
2674516 fergie could not stop laughing she says not taking themselves too seriously is the key to their relationship and the fact that they cant keep their hands off each other doesnt hurt either

2674520 dr wechts assistant told me that she discussed this matter with dr wecht and he was quite surprised that there was an allegation concerning reyes syndrome and that he is apparently ready to stand by his autopsy report
2674521 due to acute fatty change of the liver most probably a manifestation of reyes syndrome
2674522 initially dr wecht seemed to go to great pains to reassure us that since we had retained him as an expert he would never voluntarily go to the aid of the plaintiffs but of course if he were to be subpoenaed he would have to go and testify as to his opinion
2674523 dr wecht claims that whenever we contacted him about this case to include providing him with a copy of the hospital chart and the plaintiffs expert witness reports he took it upon himself to re review the case to include researching the literature examining the slides and also showing the slides to other pathologists particularly at childrens hospital of pittsburgh
2674524 although the change was ultimately disadvantageous to the defense science required the change to be made
2674525 1 chw to call defense attorney and tell them that benninger came to chw on dr reillys permission
2674526 2 attorney benninger has second autopsy report regarding reyes syndrome
2674527 4 chw will not bill now will do so later
2674528 i was quite surprised and disappointed by the judges ruling that prohibited you from calling me to testify in this case
2674529 after all i was a fact witness and inasmuch as this is a death case with the cause of death as the principle issue i would think that the pathologist who performed the autopsy would be the most important witness
2674530 i hope that you obtain a plaintiffs verdict if not i assume you probably will appeal based on the judges ruling pertaining to me as well as any other likely points of trial error
2674531 i did not think in my 40 years of medicine that thats what it was
2674532 if someone repeatedly convolutes the truth and thats what they did they sold the wrong medicine to buy justice
2674533 dr chauhans inability to come to grips with the consequences of his treatment of ms santello and his subsequent attempts to lash out at all involved including the parents is a regrettable repetition of the same lack of judgment reflected in the expert reports roundly criticizing his care in the first place
2674534 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2674535 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2674536 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2674537 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2674538 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2674539 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2674540 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2674541 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2674542 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2674543 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2674544 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2674545 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2674546 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2674547 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2674548 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2674549 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2674550 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2674551 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2674552 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2674553 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2674554 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2674555 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2674556 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2674557 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2674558 panasonics toughbook cf 29 comes closer to an indestructible notebook than anything weve seen
2674559 panasonics toughbook cf 29 comes closer to an indestructible notebook than anything weve seen
2674560 they knew full well that she had no access to her journalistic work product after they abruptly terminated her
2674561 were going to play on everything good that people know about wysp
2674562 nbc15 will allow me more creativity than i had in philadelphia
2674563 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2674564 made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2674565 he has been driven to be outspoken by the appalling prospect of his silence in the wake of worsening chinese repression
2674566 were trying to make it clear that they need to step it up
2674567 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2674568 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2674569 were not wearing apparel that identified them as members of the u s delegation at the time of the attack
2674570 its far too early to suggest that this has anything to do with the olympics taking place
2674571 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2674572 im really shocked to hear there has been an attack here
2674573 here in beijing is very safe i have been walking outside at 3 a m you never see anything like this maybe this is related with the olympics i didnt expect anything like this it is shocking
2674574 i doubt they would have said anything at all if it didnt involve foreigners
2674575 such things are very unusual not just in this area but all of beijing i am shocked i am very shocked this is tragic
2674576 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2674577 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2674578 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2674579 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2674580 we have built a series of structures and walked away from them historically
2674581 if youve got potholes in the road people go out and fix them thats not the case with levees
2674582 just because there was not as much enforcement as there should have been doesnt mean we are vacating our rules
2674583 the whole thing is not what you would normally see in a neighborhood thats what zoning laws are for
2674584 i think nobody wants to do the job and i dont know if theyre afraid or intimidated or what
2674585 if theres a density issue we would have to take action does that mean theyd have to remove two statues or five or what
2674586 a political response to the issues that have been brought to the officials attention
2674587 in many ways these species are the power plants and lungs of the ecosystems
2674588 i dont know if anything compares to it anywhere in the world
2674589 were interested in finding out what are the rare things in each group
2674590 and what does the park need to do to protect them now and in the future
2674591 a lot of scientists want so badly to be involved that they donate a lot of their time
2674592 we keep finding things in places that we thought we knew
2674593 he told me to wait for the sunbathers and then try to fit in with them
2674594 if you ask me theres a certain amount of racism in it
2674595 for a person with just a mental health diagnosis its near impossible to find an appropriate placement
2674596 its a way to keep myself civilized because the streets will do some damage
2674597 those who hope in the lord will renew their strength
2674598 rarely does a case get solved by only forensic evidence
2674599 here the science is highly informative but its also limited
2674600 obviously we anticipated that we would have had to defend the reliability of our scientific findings at trial and were confident we would have been able to do so
2674601 anthrax spends the majority of time as a spore thats why we dont see diversity in the genome that we see in other organisms
2674602 as we got better at sequencing we got a better feel for what the snps were and where the occurred
2674603 he must have used some other new technique that we dont know about
2674604 rapidly and responsibly meet the needs of the iraqi people
2674605 sustain to plan to budget execute and provide those services for the people
2674606 the challenge has been to come up with a distribution plan
2674607 there is an agreement to use five trucks that will work for eight hours to deliver water to the residents
2674608 in the olympic games you have to be ready to swim at any time
2674609 i wanted to showcase different styles in the same piece
2674610 well we have this building thats pretty ugly why dont we just have them paint the building
2674611 what we dont want to do is make graffiti seem like its just really thuggish
2674612 get to really express exactly what they want to do
2674613 it isnt doing anybody any harm its actually probably making the place look a little better
2674614 this is not a traditional republican campaign for president of the united states in new jersey largely because we intend to win it
2674615 with numbers like these its very hard for mccain to make up that gap
2674616 i think you need to start off with a much narrower spread at this point to make it a game changer
2674617 this is a state with a large veterans population a state with a lot of seniors and john mccains story appeals to the vast middle of new jersey politics
2674618 were going to win new jersey for john mccain because of what were doing here today
2674619 john mccain looked me in the eye after the hamilton event on the bus and said build a grassroots organization in new jersey
2674620 we believe theres lots of people who may have made a different choice if the battle was between hillary clinton and john mccain but thats not the campaign thats going into november
2674621 that is a really really big incentive to say something has to change
2674622 if i can knock on 10 000 doors to go to the legislature
2674623 we can knock on a whole lot more to send john mccain to the white house
2674624 it shouldnt be as much of a problem to get onto a beach in new jersey as it is
2674625 not only just get to the shore but park there and enjoy the experience
2674626 you shouldnt have to worry about being hauled away in handcuffs for sitting down on a beach
2674627 you have the right to swim in the ocean to get out of it and sit or lie down on the sand
2674628 the turnover is intended precisely to let even more people use and enjoy our beaches
2674629 people expect that there are no go areas but the law doesnt support that
2674630 everyone has been saying its a done deal but its not a done deal
2674631 we respect their right of freedom of speech and the right to demonstrate
2674632 but we do expect they will respect our private property
2674633 well respect their right to protest and first amendment right to freedom of speech
2674634 ive never in my 731 2 years ever been arrested as awful as that sounds i would do it
2674635 im concerned we are watching our nations ice breaking capabilities decline
2674636 we are in a five nation race for the arctic and right now we are running fifth
2674637 im glad that im healthy enough to really see this i would never imagine it
2674638 it was barely barely enough for basic food the end of the month wed run out of money
2674639 every other leader met with president hu jintao shook his hand only president bush patted him on the back
2674640 i believe the leadership of china is going that way too
2674641 and my brother bought them a shower connected to a heater
2674642 we think china will accept it and think about it china is not as it was 20 years ago its modern china now its interacting with the world every way it can
2674643 if i go and look for another job they will check my record and who knows what would happen
2674644 but at the same time if i was working for the federal government i would have done the same thing to save the country with what was going on at the time
2674645 i think it would be appropriate to have some official statement that the case is closed and there is no wrongdoing found so there is some public closure to the case
2674646 were confident that bruce ivins was the only one involved in this attack
2674647 they were not charged or arrested what happened was a highly publicized search
2674648 their integrity and service to the city had been exemplary
2674649 our careers were destroyed nobody would have employed us they stood by us from day one to today
2674650 she was working for the army with a clearance and her husband was being interrogated
2674651 i would tell her next time i travel you have to go with us and show your badge
2674652 three agents came from here three agents came from there almost unbuckling their guns literally it was an x files movie scene a hollywood movie scene
2674653 they pulled me out of the car spread me on the boot trunk of the car and said spread your legs do you have any weapons this was happening to me for the first time in my life people were looking at me it was a pretty embarrassing situation
2674654 we were clear in our hearts we let them do what they wanted to do we knew we were innocent
2674655 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2674656 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them
2674657 obviously it turns a defining element of his biography his reputation as a devoted family man upside down
2674658 but if he shows a continued commitment to his core issues and no additional facts emerge that contradict his story he could eventually join the disturbingly large club of public figures whove rebounded from similar events
2674659 i have always reacted negatively to those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others lives
2674660 it may not be in five years but it will certainly be within a decade china has such a strategic approach to everything they wont be benchmarking against some atoll in the pacific they will be saying what is the world standard and trying to better it seeking prominence and world recognition
2674661 i dont think the success of cricket in china depends on having hundreds of thousands of people playing it in the park on a saturday afternoon i think it depends on promoting it as a television product
2674662 look at india and the commercialisation of cricket there there is no reason why that cant happen in china its a growing economy its a changing economy but its also an economy that is becoming an avid consumer of western culture
2674663 whats in it for cricket there is so much competition for all types of sports now and cricket is no different to any other product in the sense that it cant afford to ignore china
2674664 i dont think you should put civil rights above safety what about the civil rights of the other skaters
2674665 det h r m ste jag ber tta f r honom

2674670 next generation computing should develop anticipatory user interfaces that are human centred built for humans and based on naturally occurring ways people communicate
2674671 these processes shift human activity away from real physical objects emphasising virtual over physical environments
2674672 the focus of future research efforts in the field should be primarily on tackling the problem
2674673 this problem should be treated as one complex problem rather than a number of detached problems in human sensing context sensing and human behaviour understanding

2674675 officer palmere stated he believed his decision to be a poor one

2674696 i chose to love you in silence for in silence i find no rejection i chose to love you in your loneliness for in your loneliness no one owns you but me
2674697 mike was probably thinking of giving the line some confidence to slow down the pass rush
2674698 youre not keeping him throwing the ball youre doing it so that when he does throw he can have success
2674699 i thought he had great command he was moving the offense alex was moving the ball too although his throws were not as efficient he didnt have the turnovers but he made throwing errors that j t did not shaun was more difficult to evaluate playing with the backups
2674700 hes got the body 6 foot 219 pounds the speed 4 47 in the 40 and the ability to be an nfl receiver
2674701 hes got to learn the offense and all the little intricacies that go with it
2674702 were really pleased with him we grind him pretty good i dont think he thinks hes doing that good but hes done a remarkable job
2674703 i am pretty hard on myself thats what youve got to do to keep playing youve got to be your worst critic
2674704 i think im as good as if not better than the receivers that went ahead of me
2674705 what happened was i was crossing the street coming out of a club as i was crossing the street a guy i guess it was a drunk driver almost hit me with his truck i had to jump out of the way it escalated from there
2674706 if i left town for six months id let him move into my house and wouldnt worry about one thing
2674707 i lost a lot of friends to gun violence and things like that
2674708 the summer before my junior year at virginia tech i was home for six weeks and i lost a friend every week i was home
2674709 it was the first time id heard gunshots at virginia tech
2674710 they compared us to what the new orleans saints did for katrina victims
2674711 the games gave people a chance to get out and be happy it was so depressing after the shooting the whole campus was in shock everywhere you went people were crying

2674727 clearly campaign workers and party activists can not function as well when they are being subjected to intimidation and harassment it calls into question the legitimacy of the results and the legitimacy of the councillors mandates
2674728 i chose to love you in silence for in silence i find no rejection i chose to love you in your loneliness for in your loneliness no one owns you but me
2674729 i chose to love you in silence for in silence i find no rejection i chose to love you in your loneliness for in your loneliness no one owns you but me
2674730 i chose to love you in silence for in silence i find no rejection i chose to love you in your loneliness for in your loneliness no one owns you but me
2674731 my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair
2674732 additionally austin portland san francisco and seattle are markets with large high tech economies
2674733 bloggers tend to have a different relationship with the internet than the average user they are more likely to advantage of its utility for standard household and personal tasks such as email shopping and online banking
2674734 given that they are contributing to the content of the internet itself its not surprising that bloggers are more advanced online than your average internet user and more tech savvy overall
2674735 im not looking at the downturn as a problem at all im looking at it as an opportunity i go back and i think of
2674736 so id be looking now and obviously very closely at my own business at making cutbacks where theyre really necessary id be looking for opportunities rather than being all doom and gloom about the economy
2674737 nobodys interested in somebody if you can only match them dunnes stores slogan was dunnes stores better value beats them all if the slogan had been dunnes stores better value matches them all it would have been useless i dont necessarily agree with tescos strategy which is that theyll match lidl or aldis prices if youre not good enough to beat them dont bother your barney taking them on
2674738 if you want to see if retailers and im talking about food retailers becoming competitive the best indicator ill be looking for is to see will lidl and aldi start to lose market share
2674739 id take what you read about market share if you just take one still shot of it it doesnt show a true picture the true picture is that lidl and aldi have gained market share they would be the most surprising people to gain market share everybody thought they were low market cheap retailers but by god theyre gaining market share for the new time
2674740 if i was there lidl wouldnt have the market share they have now because its far easier to stop a retailer getting big than when theyre gaining market share to take it back off them costs far more they now have momentum i would have attacked lidl and aldi from the day they set foot in the country and i would have been very price aggressive you can see it in the business im in at the moment which is health and fitness im very aggressive there on price and quality
2674741 no theyre not going to do it the way traffic is in this country and with the price of fuel people arent going to go moseying around to different shopping centres
2674742 i presume she is living in the real world but shes not living in dublin or cork or limerick or galway where most days except for august there is gridlock when people do their shopping
2674743 i think you have to lead by example a lot of the people at those talks are driving around in fancy cars paid for by the taxpayer getting big fancy wages paid by the taxpayer some paid by union members i think they should all show example and go further than a pay freeze i would say they should take a pay reduction
2674744 only time will tell i think hes up to it i do really think hes up to it but only time will tell once people come biting at your heels though i know it i brought it on myself bertie ahern knows about it whether he brought it on himself is debatable taoiseach cowen but id say he feels the odd nip on his ankles right now
2674745 there may be only one family car and you wont be going to marbella four times a year like you used to the worst that will happen is youll be going back to normal things like you had 10 years ago
2674746 its a difficult adjustment for people who are living in a kind of a fantasy world
2674747 when the democrats took control of congress in 2007 and oil was 50 a barrel and corn 2 a bushel house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid promised an energy plan were still waiting for it today crude oil is 134 and corn is 6 50 its pretty clear whos to blame congress in fact house and senate democrats have obstructed any progress in america s fight to regain some semblance of energy independence
2674748 its going to take a lot of hard work from everyone on the team
2674749 that win at sonoma wasnt easy at all once the green flag falls youve just got to stick to your strategy and hope everything works out in your favor
2674750 you go out there and run as hard as you can to see what youve got
2674751 whether we win or whether we run out of gas just doesnt matter at this point weve got to win
2674752 its important especially for the first two or three races of the chase when everybody is so worried about the points and where youre at
2674753 it really buys you some sleep and peace of mind at the start of the chase
2674754 weve got to get at least two weeks in a row to get good finishes to solidify our place its not like were getting caught up in wrecks its just dumb stuff that we get caught up in were inconsistent right now we run top 10 and then run in the 40s
2674755 right now i feel like theres five races left we can have no more than two bad races

2674762 with problems of this magnitude in the world hes concerned with hunting down another myth
2674763 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2674764 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2674765 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2674766 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2674767 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2674768 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2674769 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2674770 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2674772 just everywhere out here laid out on the ground they are bloody
2674773 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders georgian president mikheil saakashvili said in an interview with the bbc on saturday
2674774 force the georgian side into peace he later said he would order an investigation into accusations by south ossetian refugees of georgian acts of genocide
2674775 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops bush told reporters
2674776 completely devastated the black sea port of poti in attacks that the countrys un ambassador likened to
2674777 to ensure stability authorities have strengthened controls on non residents to root out trouble and stepped up controls on key people religious figures and trouble making petitioners to stay abreast of things
2674778 right then i knew i was starting to get more and more excited
2674779 at 1 50 i saw the clock and how tight we were together
2674780 i thought this was going to be pretty painful the last 200 meters i knew the breaststroke was going to be the key to race and i think that was my fastest breaststroke split ever
2674781 i remember coming off the last wall in athens and it was kind of the same feeling
2674782 i saw myself out there i sort of started smiling and then i realized i was hurting and they could catch me if i didnt start moving
2674783 thats a pretty special feeling i waved and nodded my head back thats a pretty special to have the president here cheering you on
2674784 i was just thinking about everything ive been through this year it was just really emotional
2674785 its going to take a lot of hard work from everyone on the team
2674786 that win at sonoma wasnt easy at all once the green flag falls youve just got to stick to your strategy and hope everything works out in your favor
2674787 you go out there and run as hard as you can to see what youve got

2674807 hes like a regular guy hes stern but at the same time theres no talking down to you hes just talking to you like one of the guys hes been very supportive the whole time
2674808 we did a voluminous amount of research not only on brett as a player but also as a person and made sure we thought he could fit in in the locker room we were extremely comfortable about just what he did on the field but just as importantly what he is off the field and what he stands for
2674809 we dont know what to make of favre trade either
2674810 wait he publicly demanded respect from his management just like i did but i got branded a villain and hes still a hero and i never actually walked away from the sport like he did and the commissioner never tried to step in to mediate with me what am i missing here
2674811 gave everything you had including that long teary retirement speech
2674812 sort of the way the packers were when they refused to release me or honestly trade me to a willing partner
2674813 i changed my mind now unlock the door and let me back in
2674814 some good some bad about what i anticipated for having everything in normally we have a scrimmage before we have this scrimmage in the stadium but i didnt do it this year obviously we need some more work there offensively
2674815 he did a good job for a true freshman seeing all the things he has to see
2674816 hes got to learn where to make the right cuts hes got a lot of growth but you can see he has ability hes really pushing for the second team spot right now hes a smart guy too that really helps
2674817 i think hes learning and i see him getting better
2674818 i thought turner did better than hes been doing in practice thats his m o
2674819 i think its definitely a possibility right now its shaping up to be something like that
2674820 it will drop enough to put you child through your alma mater
2674821 you know what annoys me how games journalists these days never take anything seriously games are serious and if we want them to be taken seriously we have to be serious about games serious about gaming and serious about taking games and gaming seriously im serious about this
2674822 you dont play arsenal each day it is a tricky draw we already said that
2674823 but in football anything can happen we must prepare ourselves well and work like crazy for each other on the field
2674824 we must go into the match relaxed and with the belief that we can win there is no pressure for us
2674825 this is a brilliant marketing move for myspace or for hilton or maybe they actually like each other all weve confirmed is that they are definitely dating

2674851 jo nell lowry is most deserving of this recognition she has been and continues to be the first one to step up when volunteers are needed her service to the alumni association and uca is invaluable
2674852 the addition was necessary because of our increased studentgrowth our projected growth and we wanted to improve the quality of our facilities and amenities
2674853 weve added at least one kindergarten classroom maybe two if enrollment warrants it
2674854 i think the most special part of the addition is were updating our facilities up to the standards set by the state
2674855 i think the students who were here last year will be pleased the construction is done
2674856 i knew nothing about municipal government i didnt know the difference between an ordinance and a resolution
2674857 i knew i needed to be here every day even if the position is part time i was guilty as anyone of not know ing who i needed to talk to when i had a problem so i wanted to learn everything i could
2674858 my brother wanted to name me carolyn jane i have a few friends who call me that but my father said i could pick my own middle name when i was older so on my birth certificate it just says carolyn moore
2674859 my dad was a man of few words whatever he said i listened i was blessed with caring parents but we werent the touchy kind i knew they loved me i had a good happy childhood
2674860 my mother wouldve rather been outside she enjoyed landscaping the grounds of the courthouse the library and dardanelle hospital
2674861 we first met outside a restaurant and i asked him what he was doing and he said something like im looking for a date and i said well you found one
2674862 i thought id fill my time with golf and play bridge but that got old after a month so i went back to school
2674863 going to college was always something that i knew iddo i dont remember specifically wanting to be a teacher but i do remember my brother thought i should be an airline stewardess
2674864 i thought it was important for everyone to know how to type even boys my husband was one of those hunt and peck typists so i would type up his papers
2674865 dana merritt our former mayor left things stable and there were several projects he started that i wanted to see completed such as merritt park and the senior activities center
2674866 i think the biggest concerns facing our residents right now are the rising cost of gas and the safe return of our national guard unit from iraq
2674867 i enjoy getting up each morning going out and seeing how the day unfolds and if i can help somebody
2674868 when im not with my family i have a close group of friends theres five of us girls we go out and eat and go to all the sporting events the radio station calls us the mayor and her posse i really wish they would call us something else but ive been unsuccessful in trying to change that
2674869 i would not have been able to do this job if it wasnt for our outstanding council support from the community and the hard work of our city employees
2674870 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2674871 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2674872 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2674873 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i will have a chance for tomorrow i have to wait but its great to be here
2674874 i guess the course is going to change quite a bit
2674875 its still going to be playing difficult but probably not to the extreme it was playing the last couple of days
2674876 you cant depress people or they wouldnt sit in your chair
2674877 some are suicidal after losing everything they had for the entire month
2674878 all you can say is i hope the economy will turn around
2674879 tired or not of hearing it you have to go along with it the complaints are justified
2674880 i just listen theres not much more i can do
2674881 people tell you whats going on with their lives and you try to be upbeat
2674882 you cant depress them or they wouldnt sit in your chair
2674883 by the time they walk out of here we want them to feel good about themselves

2674887 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2674888 i couldnt believe that i actually felt better not fantastic but better
2674889 and i wanted to know why and i wanted to help others
2674890 someone said to me why are you sitting through all this testimony and i said i dont want to be surprised by anything in traumatic grief thats when your stomach does a flip when you get an intense headache and when you want to go to bed for three days
2674891 well there is no law that says i have to but thats my son aaron whos going to stand for him
2674892 ive gone back and forth in my mind on the death penalty
2674893 if i were the state could i give a lethal injection
2674894 probably not if i had the chance to stop what happened any mother would rip the face off that person but can i do it after the fact im not sure
2674895 the dream came true for me in 2004 but this time around there was something different
2674896 i had some hops and stuff but the routine is so difficult that those are really unavoidable
2674897 i really didnt feel that i got rewarded for the tougher elements but im very proud of this routine at the end of it i felt like i was an olympic champion again
2674898 thats what the olympics are about thats what i worked so hard for to have a moment like that
2674899 in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world
2674900 dont worry before the tribulation comes you will be translated raptured
2674901 hey i can use that in the time of tribulation

2674911 for a lot of foreigners the only image of china comes from old movies that make us look poor and pathetic
2674912 now look at us we showed the world we can build new subways and beautiful modern buildings the olympics will redefine the way people see us
2674913 the world has never needed mutual understanding mutual toleration and mutual cooperation as much as it does today
2674914 i came to beijing last night to celebrate the olympics even though i dont have a ticket
2674915 china is never more glorious than today the whole world is watching us
2674916 this is a huge gathering for sports lovers and i am one of them
2674917 this is a lot more than about china if we think this is only chinas moment its a big mistake its the moment of the world
2674918 the tao is infinite eternal why is it eternal it was never born thus it can never die why is it infinite it has no desires for itself thus it is present for all beings the master stays behind that is why she is ahead she is detached from all things that is why she is one with them because she has let go of herself she is perfectly fulfilled
2674919 these emotions youre feeling are just pieces they are just your reactions to the situations
2674920 one of the least reported and most scandalous features of the khartoum regimes domestic policies
2674921 national wealth and power to further enrich itself and its cronies while the marginalized regions of the country suffer from terrible poverty
2674922 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity
2674923 i love him so much that i would ski naked down mount everest with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2674924 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2674925 im ready to fight everybody everybody who deserves a shot
2674926 you know i want to put the fight together lets do it
2674927 what makes this complicated is that until the whole package is done its not done
2674928 yes we have things on the table that weve agreed to
2674929 they are obviously going to be extremely attentive not just to the substance but also to the presentation
2674930 have granted us exclusive jurisdiction for u s troops and dod defense department employees
2674931 the iraqis can bring forward any concerns on any cases and we may decide to let them handle it
2674932 it wasnt in mississippi it was in illinois that jarred people
2674933 add the fact that its where lincoln is buried you have a lot of symbolism lincoln was a live memory to a lot of people
2674934 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2674935 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man

2674952 its very cool and comfortable there with a lot of water and trees
2674953 there arent many people who farm here but a lot of people who buy vegetables

2674967 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2674968 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2674969 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2674970 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2674971 im a proud champion and im ready to fight everybody who deserves a shot
2674972 i know bj penn wants a shot and im ready for him

2674983 fifty years ago australia was one of the most equal societies in the world today we are one of the most unequal of all the industrialised nations again the mineral export industries are influential the industry is capital intensive and commodity prices have been driven up by demand in china so mining companies can afford to pay very high wages compared with manufacturing or services in cities like perth the high incomes of mining workers on fly in fly out contracts are driving house prices to levels that put the australian dream beyond the reach of more and more young families while the good times of the mining boom roll on we should be using the revenue to invest in a cohesive social future rather than allowing the windfall gains to widen inequality

2674986 i fell off the horse when i fought mir and i got back on that stallion and rode off on it ive been trying to work on everything every day to be a complete fighter and a contender in the ufc
2674987 i know how hard it was to fight roger huerta i trained very hard for him and hes going to be a champion
2674988 i didnt want to get into a brawl with him i wanted to be technical and i think i was able to do that
2674989 i was very surprised i wasnt able to submit him hes very strong very technical with his hips hes tough as nails
2674990 i really wanted to have a dominant performance against roger its up to the ufc whether i get a title shot
2674991 i want to be the best fighter i nthe world and i will show more than i did tonight when i get a title shot
2674992 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected

2674995 and that he planned to be back at work on monday there was nothing in his tone that would make me think he was thinking about resigning
2674996 mayor kilpatrick thanked his team for their continued commitment and focus on moving the city of detroit forward he told the staff he plans to continue his work on moving an aggressive agenda forward for the city of detroit
2674997 very shaken by what happened as well he should have been to be treated like that
2674998 im sure the mayors family is going to be very happy to have the mayor back home
2674999 the mayor says that he serves god and he speaks to god and hes chosen by god so hopefully those who also say that they have been chosen by god if they speak to him then maybe god will speak to the mayor and he will step down
2675000 i do personally think it is far past time for the business community to speak up on this matter
2675001 it is past time for religious leadership to join those leaders that have spoken up i just think the mayor needs to hear that as talented and charismatic as he is its over its time to let it go
2675002 detroit needs and deserves a mayor who is fully engaged in the business of the city and who is able to lead with credibility and authority

2675011 whither art thou gone father why hast thou forsaken thine archdeacon with whom always thou hast offered the bloodless sacrifice take thy son with thee that i may be thy companion in having blood shed for christ

2675052 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2675053 the absence of our great poet mahmud darwish the love of palestine and the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2675054 darwish is the essential breath of the palestinian people the eloquent witness of exile and belonging
2675055 we have come out with incentives tariff to promote renewable energy already proposals to establish 20 mw solar power have come from indian companies

2675070 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation
2675071 the settlement gave those children a sense of security that could not be guaranteed if they had to sit across from him in the courtroom and testify before a jury
2675072 the machinery moved no one is working and the parking lots have reopened people are shopping
2675073 i walked up and asked him what he was doing
2675074 he said you and your muscleman dont scare me ill protect myself
2675075 that was what i was trying to do 50 years ago and the attorney general of texas stopped me
2675076 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2675077 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2675078 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2675079 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2675080 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be

2675083 row is not between jammu hindus and kashmiri muslims as branded by some section of the media but rather a fight of nationalist forces against separatist elements
2675084 you can see hindus sikhs and even muslims out on roads to support the movement
2675085 its a movement of four lakh kashmiri pandits who are bearing the brunt of being refugees in their own country for over 19 years and its a movement of every indian who consider jammu and kashmir as integral part of india
2675086 this public outcry is to throw out each and every separatist out of this country so that people of jammu and kashmir and rest of india could shun fear forever and live in peace and tranquillity
2675087 we have received a communication from the concerned authorities to stop the construction work barring main road work till further order
2675088 we have taken a pause to reappraise the alignment this has been done to avoid wastage of money and resources on the project
2675089 the existing alignment is causing so much problem and in any case very little progress has been done since the commencement of the work in the last four and half years
2675090 we have received reports of firing from usman chawk jadubari chawk and some other areas of nandigram since early hours of the day
2675091 we are thinking of setting up a police camp at usman chawk and have also sent police teams to other places
2675092 the new ipp model announced for urea would make new investments feasible in this sector which would reduce indias dependence on imports
2675093 the new ipp policy would provide a level playing field that would encourage closed units to reopen and existing units to expand as the pricing would be linked to price of imports
2675094 the country should be able to achieve higher average yield and increase in cotton crop production of about 45 million bales by fy 12
2675095 our average yield of 560 kg per hectares is yet to catch up with the world average of 785 kg per hectares but i am confident that we have a clear potential to increase our yield significantly in coming years

2675103 the fall in production is very marginal there is no major reason behind it it is basically due to weather related issues
2675104 darjeeling produces only eight million kg of tea which is just one per cent of the total production in the country so the unrest in the region can hardly impact overall output
2675105 these psus have contracted 2 8 lakh tonnes of edible oils out of which 1 65 lakh tonnes have been shipped for the indian ports

2675107 i saw how parthiv was hit on his nose during the third and final test against sri lanka it was surprising to see him without a helmet maybe he was confident but parthiv was fortunate to have hit on the nose
2675108 the ball came off the pad and him hard but my injury was very serious im glad that parthiv could come and keep again he needs to put on some ice and he would be fine
2675109 i would fail in my duty if i need not comment on the manner in which deposition has been made by witness appearing for the government senior home ministry officials
2675110 it is equally sorry state of affairs when a senior officer of the central government appears before the tribunal to submit that he is not aware with regard to matters which are put to him
2675111 it is certainly no excuse to say that you were not posted in the department or were not designate responsible for the decision making appearing as a witness for the union government it becomes the duty and the responsibility of such officer to be fully aware of the matter with regard to which he is going to depose
2675112 it is shocking to know that for a minor re arrangement of some words for a few words at the end of the notification the notification of 2008 is almost a verbatim reproduction of the notification which was issued in 2006
2675113 with deep pain i would say that this is the most callous disregard of the statutory duty
2675114 even a single witness or a single case may be sufficient to support the claim of the government that an association is indulging in activities which is covered within the definition under the act

2675166 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2675167 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2675168 he was just so alive i cant believe hes gone
2675169 it was such a popular show because of his bigger than life persona

2675174 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2675175 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2675176 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2675177 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2675178 it was a magical and memorable spectacle and a great way to start the beijing olympics
2675179 the little man is healthy happy and as loud as his daddy
2675180 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2675181 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2675182 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2675183 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2675184 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2675185 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2675186 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2675187 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2675188 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2675189 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2675190 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2675191 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2675192 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2675193 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2675194 she has decided that she will need a few more weeks than originally planned to be ready for her return to the stage
2675195 he had a soul that is often missing in the business which has taken on much more of a corporate tone
2675196 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead
2675197 we got a dead person a 250 a week raise i knew i was in the right business
2675198 you take care of everything and get them ready for the day
2675199 how do you take an actor or comedian or a writer and point them in the right direction and go through all that garbage unless you love it and love them and think theyre talented and worth it
2675200 i put about 20 films in development at lorimar and ended up making six lousy movies two good movies and one great movie

2675203 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2675204 i for the life of me cant imagine how that could be a proportional response to allegations that georgians had fired upon russian peacekeepers
2675205 our navy sailors have been assigned the task of preventing arms and other military supplies from reaching georgia by sea
2675206 these reports do not correspond with reality a coastal blockade would mean war with georgia we are not in a state of war with georgia
2675207 i enjoy our conversations our relationship is constructive and its important and also very candid
2675208 i had a very uplifting experience going to a church
2675209 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2675210 i know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events
2675211 happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
2675212 cannot be put into words but each knows his or her importance in my familys life
2675213 but im happy with the race and the time so im feeling pretty good about that
2675214 i dont know if either one of us has a lot to be proud of today
2675215 i think both of us will be looking to get some momentum in the morning hoping it will carry us through on whats going to be a long day
2675216 as long as i have an opportunity to go make plays whether its at safety or linebacker im fine
2675217 it really felt like you were out in the country
2675218 historically we have not seen large numbers of cases of violent crimes or drug crimes
2675219 i honestly had no idea until all you guys told me
2675220 you look at it and when hes not getting results he doesnt give you any indication that hes discouraged you dont see him back off in the field you dont see him back off in his at bats he just competes
2675221 the only way you make a trade is if it somehow gives you just as good a chance to win
2675222 but when mo mentioned it was possible to trade scott for troy i said as long as troy was healthy its a hell of a move for us this guy is a winning player
2675223 a ferrari in a 25kph country will still be a ferrari its just that you cant run as fast as you can youre bound by the law of the 24kph country
2675224 its been a playroom the kids have their friends over and we have had after prom parties here
2675225 competition can drive you but it cant be your main focus because then you can get distracted with that and not focus on learning the offense and learning how to lead the team
2675226 and just go out there and have fun and whatever happens happens
2675227 hell take my dishes every day in the dining hall for lunch and dinner
2675228 thats about the only thing that i make him do
2675229 hes been able to step right into our no huddle offense and been able to run it and execute it and not be out there with his head spinning which happens to a lot of freshmen especially at the quarterback position
2675230 once he learns the game and figures out where to go with the football
2675231 then hell start relaxing and then hell actually start being a player
2675232 youve always got to be vocal and encouraging your teammates
2675233 keeping them up all the time and just really being a positive enforcer
2675234 chase patton did a real good job today and any time somebodys not there its an opportunity for somebody else
2675235 i felt that without question patton did some good things and i thought blaine did some good things
2675236 whether its a practice or a preseason game you want to perform well
2675237 certainly tonight wasnt a good practice but the good thing is the nfl is about the 16 weeks in the regular season you can kind of take a mulligan now and try to do a better job
2675238 i have to give credit to the secondary on that play
2675239 they had great coverage and the quarterback had to go to his third option
2675240 i turned my head real quick and i saw it i stuck my hand up and it actually dislocated my finger i had to snap it back in place
2675241 compared to the other two drives anything wouldve been better
2675242 i had no real problems as far as pain or anything like that my thing is more mental and just using the shoulder without thinking about it and getting comfortable and doing the things im used to doing
2675243 there were some things in there that even i didnt know
2675244 fifth street gym was his theater it was his stage
2675245 i used to go to the gym five six seven days a week it was like home for me everything was a holiday there when you think about all those great characters who came in there it was like going to a picnic when i went to that gym you couldnt duplicate that scene now they have a new gym down there on the beach but they teach boxer cise now
2675246 the u s consumer is grossly undereducated with respect to credit
2675247 i havent given it any thought whatsoever not one bit
2675248 ive always believed in myself if i had ever stopped believing in myself i wouldnt be here right now
2675249 im not going to stand here and say i expected to make the all star game this year but i came to spring training confident i could have an impact for this team regardless of the level ive been at whenever ive been healthy ive been that player
2675250 i think he has a real good approach in rbi situations
2675251 but whats going to happen is other teams are going to pitch him differently hes going to have to do the albert thing where he studies studies studies and adjusts on the fly that doesnt come natural albert is a perfect example hes got a lot of motivation to do it
2675252 when he shows consistency you start to overlook the bad games
2675253 its not a red flag when a guy has a couple bad games
2675254 luddys a difficult one to evaluate that way because he doesnt have that much major league experience
2675255 given the opportunity he has performed at a high level but to project on that is very difficult not only analytically but on the scouting side
2675256 its not like ive never hit 25 home runs before
2675257 i havent done it at this level because ive been injured or i havent been given this kind of opportunity but its not like im not capable of doing it
2675258 its just a matter of whether hell be a consistent power hitter hes shown the ability this year to get hits even when hes not hitting the ball out of the park
2675259 usually thats not how it is after the first 200
2675260 i think it made my breast stroke in the third 100 meters a lot stronger and at that point coming home in the freestyle its all adrenaline
2675261 i think im prepared as i can be at this moment
2675262 that was so fast we might have a hard time topping it
2675263 any time you think you can get close to michael phelps
2675264 if we win that game youre thinking 3 2 2 1 hes pitched as well against us as anybody its baseball you never figure anything out
2675265 that never happens its one of those fluke type things
2675266 we were aggressive the wind was blowing out it was one of those weird days at wrigley its finally good to get a guy like that
2675267 theres enough significance to getting even in this series and keeping our chances alive thats enough right there
2675268 this guy zambrano is as tough as anybody in baseball he just had an off day the significance is were playing a rubber game tomorrow
2675269 today he made a couple and we took advantage of them
2675270 he throws hard hes got it all its really a battle from pitch one
2675271 it was one of those games where we had opportunities and took advantage he left some balls up maybe last time we faced him he left some balls up and we popped them up or something today we didnt miss it and tomorrow we play for the series
2675272 even when he hasnt been swinging well hes never backed off and given up all of a sudden he runs into something and he gets going hes really strong between the ears its impressive to watch
2675273 download clean up format analyze report and recommend do it again
2675274 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2675275 it was a reaction that i dont even have to describe you have to understand what liz bachman is to usa volleyball shes probably the nicest person in the entire world her and her family
2675276 her family is like our family because they traveled with us she fought in the 2004 olympics with us she was my roommate in 2004
2675277 appears to be an isolated act with no connection to the olympics
2675278 it happens everybody else is going to have to play extra holes too so you just have to go out there and deal with it
2675279 it may be exhausting to play 36 holes putting that much mental effort into it well see theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed a little bit of rain so well just see what happens
2675280 it would have been nice to ride that momentum i had going
2675281 hopefully tomorrow i can still do it i dont really see us ever finishing 36 holes tomorrow but its one of those things where if you can play as much golf as you can and youre on a good roll its going to be fun to play
2675282 the rehabbers couldnt get this stuff any cheaper the owners of the house make a little extra money selling something thats just garbage for them and the load that goes to the landfill is smaller
2675283 that gently used stove you should pay only 100 for you could very easily end up paying 300 for

2675289 i had a handyman come in and look through the house
2675290 jessica was very nice about it but she said you know no man is going to want to sleep in this girlie green bedroom
2675291 we put a bed in it with pillows it was just a blowup bed
2675292 and she liked of course the fact that it was so well maintained it was a good value

2675297 we met twice so far and on all two occasions she won but at the same time both the matches went right down to the wire which means she had to break sweat getting past me i cannot predict the outcome but i can assure all that i would put my 100 percent on monday

2675307 starless fiona did wonderfully well to become the poke and probe stick for the british she did much to splash dung thereby dimming the johannesburg star her employing title
2675308 not many at the star knew she would turn out to be a serial rapist of truth on the talks
2675309 when the star ran the story which seemed to suggest the president has acceded to become the queen in the zimbabwean body politic a few white farms in masvingo were occupied by war veterans who felt the land gain was not about to be lost in the new settlement and in the countryside people cannot understand why zanu pf is partitioning or even surrendering its mandate of june 27 which is why a falsehood from south african star triggers a potentially explosive reaction here in zimbabwe in real time

2675324 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2675325 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2675326 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2675327 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2675328 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2675329 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2675330 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2675334 the first touchdown felt good because the first team was in there against their first team
2675335 it was crazy my first block out there was zach thomas
2675336 once you do that nothing really worries you anymore once you get out there its football
2675337 we didnt turn it over or have any penalties in the first half thats a good sign that youre not making any silly mistakes in the first preseason game
2675338 ive been definitely able to see progress at training camp and we were able to carry it over from practice to the game
2675339 hopefully by the last preseason game ill be ready and focused to go my timing is messed up right now but ill be alright man
2675340 we didnt play our first group very long offensively and defensively
2675341 that was on purpose one they looked sharp when they were in there two we needed to look at the rest of the guys

2675367 i found that i would select the cube when left clicking on it in object mode if the
2675368 when you want the cursor back into the cube just select the camera with rmb put the cursor into the cube following the steps above and re select the cube with rmb
2675369 ive discovered it helps a lot if you are in object mode and not in edit mode i wrote the following before discovering this
2675370 i failed at this until i had zoomed in close enough to the cube when i was too far zoomed out i kept selecting the cube rather than creating an edit point
2675371 i had the same problem and found it was because the cube was selected i made sure i was in object mode right clicked on the camera to select the camera instead of the cube and i could then position the edit point in the cube however doing this messed up the next part of the tutorial because you cannot switch into edit mode with the camera selected perhaps the suggestion of trying to put the 3d cursor in the cube should be dropped as it raises too many questions at this stage
2675372 you can deselect all by pressing the akey or the select button in the 3d view
2675373 use wireframe mode works better to get the cursor in
2675374 to get it back in the cube 1 make sure youre in object mode 2 select the cube 3 object gt snap gt cursor to selection cursor refers to the 3d cursor here so it puts it right in the middle of the cube
2675375 i think its an essential point to note that in order to place the cursor inside the cube the cube must not be selected akey was probably the best way to deselect the object
2675376 ctrl z does undo but blender doesnt seem to store nearly so many previous actions i think its only one or two
2675377 if i remember correctly undo history gets cleared when you switch between object and edit mode
2675378 i wasted a lot of time here thank you to the reader who suggested on the 3d view header object gt snap gt cursor to selection it was the only thing that worked to get the cursor visible again and placed where clicked
2675379 you can set the number of steps the undo command can do as mentioned in earlier pages
2675380 so i can move the 3d cursor but what if i want to put it back in its original spot
2675381 how do we work in a virtual 3d environment through a 2d screen
2675382 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
2675383 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2675384 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2675385 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2675386 wildflowers we usually see in late may and early june are just now starting to bloom and many local streams are full to bursting making this a great time to explore all tuolumne meadows has to offer
2675387 when youre floating down the merced river you cant help but smile
2675388 its perhaps the most peaceful and relaxing way to see yosemites spectacular scenery
2675389 once i got into high school i re ally decided that i was going to a home economics teacher and come back here to teach so thats what my goal was
2675390 this year we have revamped our program changed our name and we are going to begin focusing on younger students so we can help make more of a difference and get the students back into the traditional school
2675391 we know that ninth grade is the most critical and that the most dropouts come during the freshman year so that is why its so important to begin early
2675392 we started out with four rooms that had been used as storage i couldnt even open the door to get in so i just started taking things out piece by piece
2675393 i spend a lot of time under a shade tree cleaning furniture
2675394 they told me the rule should be come to schooland do right so we have put everything we do under that rule most of our students dont transition back into high school after being with us they want to stay because its safe and secure
2675395 we have graduated between 200 250 students some are in nursing school working for wal mart work as mechanics or they are in child care programs
2675396 i have received far more from this program than anyone else because i have grown from it personally you cant help someone else without receiving some of that help yourself its been a good thing all the way around
2675397 thats what makes us different we can make an individual plan for each student we specialize in helping each child in whatever area they need help in
2675398 we do a lot of assessment to find out what they need and how we can help
2675399 she offers her students excellent opportunities to improve their future she has a fantastic reputation and we can always turn to her for leadership
2675400 i dont like the attention i couldnt do a thing that i have done without the help of others the award belongs to everyone not just me
2675401 there would not be a program without the students they are what really make the program possible
2675402 my parents live with my husband and i so a lot of time is devoted to them my life is focused around church and family
2675403 if i could get my family to work with me every day then i would have it made
2675404 i havent even t hought about retirement i have a hard time letting go so when i do retire i want to stay involved in some way because it has been such a big part of my life for such a long time
2675405 i have always said t hat when i stop having fun im going home my favorite part of my job is the interaction with the students i love to see the growth in them throughout the years
2675406 the best and most beautiful things in the would cannot be seen or even touched they must be felt with the heart
2675407 to stimulate collaborative community partnerships that foster various local initiatives to inspire and implement life affirming activities
2675408 it was our first major public event we had about 200 people it provided an opportunity to sit down as a group and do something together
2675409 he korten is the seed of the inspiration for what we aredoing as institutions crumble we are choosing responses in harmony with each other and the earth
2675410 he talks about a spiritual turning understanding that we are part of life it evokes a brandnew vision
2675411 even three years ago people werent concerned much about these topics
2675412 part of what changed was tab townsell coming in as mayor which has helped lead us to whats happening now
2675413 our church found out that there was another group concerned about the environment in town and we all agreed to sit down and talk about our common concerns so we started asking ourselves what is that we really want to do
2675414 mayor townsell proposes that projected revenue from the natural gas severance tax estimated to be at least 236 448 in conway is dedicated to developing operating and maintaining alternative transportation including sidewalks bike routes and trails and public transit
2675415 we can get online and order what we want from sunday to tuesday each week
2675416 wewill also present another honeybee discussion with allison wallace on how to raise hives probably in september beacham said
2675417 there are a lot of good things going on one of the things we think is valuable is what springs forth from fccs to help bring people together we are inventing it as we go along continuing to evolve
2675418 were also going to be talking to people about the options for efficiency in conservation besides coal fired plants there are things like sun and wind technologies as well as geothermal sources instead of putting money into these coal fired plants lets provide incentives for people to create a more efficient and careful environment that doesnt put peoples heath at risk
2675419 we are working toward envisioning a future that works for all
2675420 this is a good way for students to get acquainted with each other and to learn what will happen on that first day of school
2675421 the first day of school can be a little nerve wracking for them
2675422 after weve read the book there will be a note at the end telling them that i had planned to have gingerbread boys for them to eat but they seem to have disappeared
2675423 so we all go searching for them we tour the school and when we get back there are the gingerbread boys waiting for them at their seats its a fun way to introduce them to the different areas of our school
2675424 how to raise yourhand when you want to talk or ask a question
2675425 they get to bring a toy each day that corresponds with the color we are learning
2675426 this is not an audition but just an opportunity tospend a fun and informal evening with the players reading parts of plays we might choose
2675427 fun memorable bible learning activities for kids of all ages
2675428 the missile cruiser moscow the warship smetlivy and backup vessels arrived at their destination this morning
2675429 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale
2675430 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2675431 but i do support georgias president mikheil saakashvili and what russia is doing is wrong they must stop
2675432 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2675433 stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone
2675434 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2675435 no existen h roes en los pumas necesitamos de todos para ganar
2675436 es que a nosotros siempre nos juegan a morir este es un gran equipo
2675437 the idea of watching a 14 hour delay is repulsive
2675438 we have a billion dollars worth of revenue at stake here so that means were not public television for better or worse
2675439 that homeowners realize that this is strictly an emergency measure for release of distress relief will be granted only to those who are unable to carry out the provisions of their mortgages or whose homes have been foreclosed within the past two years the neediest cases will be selected and acted upon first we will be as liberal as we can in granting loans keeping in mind the limitations of the law
2675440 in 1961 les crane arrived in san francisco fresh from a short gig as program director for a philadelphia radio station he was hired by bartell family radio the corporate owners of kya to be operations manager to renovate and remodel their noisy but unsuccessful format
2675441 kewb had started up in oakland and was taking away listeners crane dumped all the garbage and replaced it with one three second jingle radio kya that followed every record he brought in east coast payola refugees
2675442 crane asked me if i liked using the name lucky logan
2675443 his gig at kya didnt last long maybe a little over a year bartell brought in a new station manager named
2675444 at kgo he initiated one of the first call in talk shows on san francisco radio he began hosting a late evening show from the hungry i his forthright style delighted and irritated callers and listeners
2675445 after his hollywood fling les basically disappeared from the spotlight in the late 1970s he formed a software company software toolworks was sold and renamed mindscape in the early 1990s crane cashed out for around half a billion dollars
2675446 he called a few days later i could tell from his voice that he was not as healthy as he once was we discussed our various health problems and he told me he was a recluse i told him i would love to interview him about kya
2675447 we made arrangements to visit the next time i visited the bay area
2675448 so i guess i wont get to ask him about kya and a few memories i meant to share will remain mine alone but im glad i was able to touch base with les after 45 years he was my mentor and friend an innovator and a success at nearly everything he attempted he deserves the credit for changing popular music in san francisco in the years before the beatles changed it all again
2675449 we have decided to go in a different direction with our morning team
2675450 both were totally unexpected very pleasantly surprising and greatly appreciated
2675451 im very proud of what weve been able to accomplish
2675452 the bay area has produced some mighty fine broadcasters and i am flattered to have been able to compete with them
2675453 so long old paint i reckon i must cash in my chips
2675454 for the sake of the environment it is critical to look at future steel vehicle as all vehicles from a life cycle assessment lca perspective
2675455 based on the recent lca study and model developed at the university of california santa barbara implementation of more efficient powertrain systems elevates the importance of the emissions from material production placing greater emphasis on selecting a low greenhouse gas intensive material such as steel
2675456 compared to other materials used to reduce vehicle weight these advanced high strength steels produce five to 15 times less ghg emissions during the material manufacturing phase which greatly reduces a vehicles life cycle carbon footprint
2675457 were not just looking at the vehicle design and its impact on ghg at the tailpipe
2675458 were concerned with the whole life cycle of the vehicle from the emissions produced and energy used to create raw materials all the way to the impact of recycling if the whole life cycle is not taken into account there is the distinct possibility of having a net increase in ghg if the wrong material choice is made this isnt just speculation weve got very clear models that demonstrate this
2675459 have you ever seen the ocean its darker at the bottom
2675460 im probably a couple of thousand behind gene simmons or maybe a couple of thousand in front
2675461 i cant even remember the last time i had sex randy newman is probably the guy who put it about more than anybody hes got that look about him that crazed look
2675462 someone asked me how i cleaned up so i told them i went to switzerland and had my blood completely changed
2675463 i was just fooling around i opened my jacket and said how do you like my blood change thats all it was a joke i was sick of answering that question so i gave them a story
2675464 i never have been dont you think for a second that if i was gay i wouldnt make damn sure everybody choked on that one man id ruin everybodys day with that one
2675465 but i wasnt going to have this album circulating around the world in bad quality
2675466 but i was always a musician when i was a teenager if someone came along and said you get three weeks wages for one days work just standing around in front of the camera anyone would take it it probably amounted to about three jobs in my whole life that myth got blown slightly out of proportion
2675467 christian bale comes out from underneath the fence and walks outside and up into the barracks all the way through all the americans and gets to the end with john malkovich
2675468 its this six minute steadicam shot and it gets to the end to my part and i have one line in the movie and i screw it up and im like ohhh ohh ohh sorry sorry sorry should we cut or
2675469 we laughed about that story years later with spielberg but it was really one of those moments i really screwed up
2675470 hes gonna call me up and say i want to do a great big movie with you but i want you to have the highest risk factor and i want to maybe put you up to ridicule and have people hate you for doing something that you should have known was wrong to do
2675471 im sure there are people who out of context wonder about it and i totally respect that
2675472 because out of context youd say whats going on here but we were always clear when we were making the movie what was our intention and where the humor was coming from that youd have an actor who goes too far who takes himself so seriously believes that he can transform into any role and is wrongheaded
2675473 he used to be irish he became australian while we were shooting
2675474 so it was funny when he dropped character because he still had the makeup on and youd get this irish accent out of context but then it seemed funnier as we worked on it that he stayed in character so that developed into his issue in the movie that he was sort of afraid to drop character
2675475 but then dale got another job he went off to do the miniseries the pacific with spielberg and downey ended up showing up late because he was still shooting iron man so the whole boot camp thing just became a cast dinner
2675476 i give him a lot of s for it but i love the guy and i respect him immensely people were dropping like flies
2675477 hes not mean spirited thats not ben its just hes obsessed with the idea of delivering the best product he can
2675478 when you take away the color you focus on the people more youre not distracted whereas if you watched the movie in color your eye tends to wander
2675479 we knew wed be showing the isolation and loneliness and detachment of how everyone lives here
2675480 if l a fell off the map i wouldnt miss it
2675481 the movie is full of all kinds of venom and frustration with the city
2675482 its not only the black and white cinematography but the whole way we shot the movie was more like a 1950s hollywood film every one of the shots is motivated by the exact same reasons that billy wilder would have had in mind making double indemnity or sunset boulevard not that im at that level yet we were looking at classic cinematographers like gordon willis as our model
2675483 we didnt want to do that faux documentary thing where you find the story in editing
2675484 we wanted to work with the old fashioned language of film
2675485 trumbos story feels very timely i first discovered this material before 9 11 before we had the patriot act or john ashcroft and his list we now have the dubious distinction of releasing this film during a period in american history where the issues trumbo faced really resonate with people his patriotism was questioned but you see from the letters that he fought in world war ii growing up in the depression he had this incredible range of american experience
2675486 for trumbo it was all about being loyal as a friend he would have been happy to take you around the corner to a bar for a drink and tell you yeah i joined the communist party not once but twice but to be forced to say that and worse to be asked what his friends politics were trumbo believed in the constitution and the first amendment and he never changed those beliefs to suit other peoples needs
2675487 invariably theres a price to pay one could argue that maybe trumbo wasnt being the most considerate father or husband but he had this stubborn contrarian personality and he loved to fight
2675488 at some point one of you will have a movie about your life
2675489 the coldest winter i ever spent was a summer in san francisco
2675490 i am a mealy mouthed coward who sits in this room and am afraid of my shadow
2675491 i have no courage whatsoever and no spirit of adventure
2675492 my wife and my kids use computers but i have no interest in them
2675493 i have no interest in going to mexico or the far east or to south america i have never had the vaguest curiosity about drugs i never took a puff of marijuana
2675494 we would like to back you to make a movie in barcelona
2675495 i dont want to achieve immortality through my work i want to achieve it through not dying
2675496 this play more than any i have ever worked on is revealing itself in the rehearsal process
2675497 just yesterday we were talking about the end of the play
2675498 i had felt that what she was saying was a simple kind of dull message that we work for the sake of work and through work we will find peace
2675499 and that is what sonyas saying there is something good about this life we have to be patient and keep working but we will find beauty on this earth lets commit to a job and do it well it was enlightening for me to try to look at a more positive younger vision of that final speech
2675500 he wrote it when he had just moved to melikhovo and bought this farm
2675501 i played yelena in a workshop they did to explore what sign language would reveal about chekhovs language and the silences in the play
2675502 it really showed us how active the play is these people are not passive theyre very actively trying to work out their problems trying to change sign language is so active so you really sense that side of it and then how alive the silences are when they run out of words
2675503 i had a new theater i had a new lover life was good
2675504 at least the marriage has lasted which is very nice and the theater its been a wonderful 10 years in that space to have fought such hard battles to get what i wanted in there and then get to use it has been a thrill
2675505 im actually looking forward to a time hopefully in november where the plate is kind of clear for a while and i can have some open space to think about what i want to do next
2675506 right now im too busy just trying to get the next play designed and staged directing at opera san jose has been thrilling and i hope to do more of that id like to do some more musicals i havent been able to do that many because we couldnt afford them i always love taking new looks at the classics another thing we were rarely able to afford another part of my list is to write either with michael or holly i want to do more artistic collaborations with people i respect and love

2675511 to consider ways our business tax system can be improved
2675512 id happily trade all credits for simplification and lowering the rates
2675513 the most radical left wing tax revision in half a century
2675514 to be useful a fiscal stimulus package should be implemented quickly and structured so that its effects on aggregate spending are felt as much as possible within the next 12 months or so
2675515 new stimulus package only delays that process by propping up dying industries for a while and postponing the day of reckoning
2675516 leaving or compromising free trade policies will most likely reduce growth in well being in both the advanced and less productive regions of the world protectionism breeds monopoly crony capitalism and sloth

2675528 overseas media love dissidents so china becomes a land of sorrow where people are claimed to be abused under a repressive regime or a dull place where the individual has no freedom or private life
2675529 george macartney said in 1794 that nothing can be more deceptive than to judge china by european standards and today his words continue to hold as true
2675530 we cant make it on our own because the system is stacked against us
2675531 let me offer you metaphorically two magic wands that have sweeping powers to change society with one wand you could wipe out all racism and discrimination from the hearts and minds of white america the other wand you could wave across the ghettos and barrios of america and infuse the inhabitants with japanese or jewish values respect for learning and ambition

2675595 about 300 000 vehicles enter monta a de oro each year
2675596 if we collect from a third of those cars at 5 a pop wed have 500 000 to open irish hills
2675597 weve been talking with board members of the cayucos north coast and the los osos advisory councils
2675598 cayucos and north coast advisers got it that even though they didnt like it a fee may be charged
2675599 is a priceless experience why should i pay for it
2675600 its an emotional issue but i love that people are so connected to their park
2675601 im going to bat for keeping monta a de oro open without entry fees
2675602 los osos is terribly short on park space and the county doesnt spend a lot of money on parks in los osos because there arent a lot of parks in los
2675603 also how can i tell county residents that they cant travel on their own public road
2675604 the proposal is currently on the table in budget negotiations
2675605 its caught up in the dogma of whether its considered a tax but were going to attempt to move it ahead because its revenue that gives direct value to the public by fixing the parks system
2675606 if we cant pull it off this year its an item that will go to the ballot in 2010
2675607 now gregoire supports enacting a state income tax to fund her out of control spending habits
2675608 gregoires position has been clear she is opposed to a state income tax
2675609 we dont have an electorate out there that will support it right now
2675610 but its not as if its not a good idea its not as if its not one that we shouldnt pursue its one that we just have to keep holding hearings and let time pass and eventually i assume were going to get there
2675611 im not going to discuss an income tax today when the citizens of the state of washington are afraid if theyre going to have a job tomorrow health care tomorrow or education for their family
2675612 it isnt as if this is a new idea and it hasnt been pursued historically
2675613 its time will come but its time has yet to come and its one of those issues that we have to continue to constantly have a dialogue about
2675614 falls within the scope of their rights duties and powers
2675615 we are trying to get to the flood victims bury the dead and provide medical treatment to the injured he said adding that the family of each person killed would receive three million dong 193 35
2675616 many portions of road have been destroyed said mr vinh
2675617 telecommunications cables have been cut in some areas it takes half a day to walk from the local commune headquarters to the places were victims are stranded
2675618 the pilot died when his plane crashed into a jungle near ndundu village about 250 kilometres southwest of jayapura a representative of the association of mission aviation aid group said today
2675619 we will coordinate with the provincial rescue team to evacuate the pilots body the aid worker said
2675620 its quite difficult and dangerous in these conditions we will move as soon as the weather is good he said
2675621 in dieser region gibt es schon seit l ngerer zeit terroristische aktivit ten die auf die abspaltung der region vom rest chinas hinzielen was nicht zu tolerieren ist

2675623 there could be a signing after the leaders have met to thrash out the remaining issues
2675624 dr wechts assistant told me that she discussed this matter with dr wecht and he was quite surprised that there was an allegation concerning reyes syndrome and that he is apparently ready to stand by his autopsy report
2675625 due to acute fatty change of the liver most probably a manifestation of reyes syndrome
2675626 initially dr wecht seemed to go to great pains to reassure us that since we had retained him as an expert he would never voluntarily go to the aid of the plaintiffs but of course if he were to be subpoenaed he would have to go and testify as to his opinion
2675627 dr wecht claims that whenever we contacted him about this case to include providing him with a copy of the hospital chart and the plaintiffs expert witness reports he took it upon himself to re review the case to include researching the literature examining the slides and also showing the slides to other pathologists particularly at childrens hospital of pittsburgh
2675628 although the change was ultimately disadvantageous to the defense science required the change to be made
2675629 1 chw to call defense attorney and tell them that benninger came to chw on dr reillys permission
2675630 2 attorney benninger has second autopsy report regarding reyes syndrome
2675631 4 chw will not bill now will do so later
2675632 i was quite surprised and disappointed by the judges ruling that prohibited you from calling me to testify in this case
2675633 after all i was a fact witness and inasmuch as this is a death case with the cause of death as the principle issue i would think that the pathologist who performed the autopsy would be the most important witness
2675634 i hope that you obtain a plaintiffs verdict if not i assume you probably will appeal based on the judges ruling pertaining to me as well as any other likely points of trial error
2675635 i did not think in my 40 years of medicine that thats what it was
2675636 if someone repeatedly convolutes the truth and thats what they did they sold the wrong medicine to buy justice
2675637 dr chauhans inability to come to grips with the consequences of his treatment of ms santello and his subsequent attempts to lash out at all involved including the parents is a regrettable repetition of the same lack of judgment reflected in the expert reports roundly criticizing his care in the first place

2675641 resistance to occupation is a legal right under international law
2675642 no law can be contrary to the beliefs and provisions of the sacred religion of islam
2675643 i think american journalists should concentrate on the human side of the story instead of just covering the surface the war and the political struggle in iraq are far from simple and not just a black or white vision its not just evil trying to dominate the good
2675644 there is much that americans are not aware of and its the journalists duty to educate the public so they can understand the real story in iraq
2675645 if i were to pour forth onto paper canvas or instrument an expression of that within my own heart which seeks to be expressed i do believe it would be a deluge of questions of wonderings yearnings longing it is as if i know not what to say yet yearn with my whole soul to say it
2675646 you are so naive when you americans hear the word democracy you see respect and rights and liberty and toleration when he sistani hears the word democracy all he sees is power and thats what you americans are doing giving power to a religious man who will put an end to all the freedoms you thought you were giving us once he has the chance and the power
2675647 we once thought you had the wand of moses in your hands now we see you dont

2675650 i wish i could tell iraqis that not all americans are deviants who like sexual deviation and try to enforce it on detained men
2675651 come and see those american soldiers how cowardly they are and how sexually deviant they are those homos are pedophiles
2675652 sam writes amy i just have one question in the past 3 years were there lies and acting or u really loved me and liked me i know ill never get an answer and ill never go and ask her cuz shell hurt me again u just so pretty in your pain i found my way out and ill never need u again but i miss u amy i miss u to death but i tell myself im not missing u i hope you are missing me and realizing how much i was good with u and how much u hurt me people have been stopping by sams blog to give him some advice a lot of it worth reading as violence decreases in iraq iraqi bloggers will be able to return to those issues that all of us men and women have to deal with as we go about our lives no matter where we live today our president jalal talabani sent a letter to qatars emir sheik hamad bin khalifa al thani in which he expresses his appreciation to the efforts he made to solve the crisis in lebanon and invites him to visit iraq i hope that sheik hamad bin khalifa al thani would accept talabanis invitation to visit iraq but with a magic key to get our country back on the track and then kassakhoon asks an open question which should invite some interesting commentary do you think that iraqs magic key is no long with the iraqis one of the most moving blog entries that i have read in the last few months comes from an iraqi psychiatrist and blogger named sami he posts his thoughts regularly over at sumerian friendship

2675665 let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death
2675666 the words of his mouth were smoother than butter but war was in his heart his words were softer than oil yet were they drawn swords
2675667 for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end
2675668 but being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ
2675669 trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths be not wise in thine own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil
2675670 a faithful witness will not lie but a false witness will utter lies

2675672 wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you
2675673 the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand
2675674 fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness for i the lord they god will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not i will help thee

2675701 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2675702 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2675703 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2675704 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2675705 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2675706 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2675707 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2675708 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2675709 i shoved a letter about queens landing into his hand

2675720 hover over their children swooping down to fight their battles and make decisions for them
2675721 we see it when johnny or susie visits our campus with his or her parents and its the parents who are saying we want to look at biochemistry instead of letting the students speak for themselves
2675722 but truthfully its not just the parents i believe the students are so used to a high level of parental involvement that they often dont notice that sort of comment if the students really become fed up with it they will attempt to put some space between them and their parents
2675723 there just needs to be a happy medium regarding parental involvement
2675724 most colleges offer a variety of extended services to help students make the transition from home to college
2675725 its our job to make sure students make good choices to keep them on the right track to success
2675726 parents need to do a bit of reflective thinking about their involvement in their students lives
2675727 they need to work to strike the right balance between a hands off approach and hovering
2675728 me having been on the other side of the rivalry seeing all the past outfielders tonight having barry come out the energy seemed to be up the energy in this game tonight was like the energy i remember as a dodger playing against the giants
2675729 anytime you get an opportunity to have a walk off game winning hit those are some of the most exciting moments in your career
2675730 thats stuff you dont forget almost every player remembers all his walk off hits this one was special with the dodgers being here in front of all of our fans

2675773 ive seen reports that it didnt have any understandable motivation we are actively following up with the chinese authorities and the victims family u s embassy personnel responded to the scene and are at the hospital
2675774 the president of the united states is in china and he has been fully briefed on the incident and extends his condolences to the victims and their family

2675964 gaza won its independence from the west bank one people now have two states two prisons who dont greet each other we are victims dressed in executioners clothing

2675967 i have defeated you death all the beautiful arts have defeated you the songs of mesopotamia the obelisks of egypt the carved tombs of the pharaohs on the altar have defeated you and you are vanquished

2675972 my support team has told me that in any case no matter what happens here i will always have the result that i did in athens that those cant be taken away from me and that whatever i do here will be a bonus
2675973 after that if all goes well all the better if it doesnt go well fine its not the end of the world its not life or death either its sport and we cant always be the best i hope to be but well see what happens
2675974 its more straightforward the woman to beat the woman to follow is federica now that she has the record the most difficult thing is to get into the final

2675995 theres some big saving to be had by paying off a mortgage and its risk free you control how fast it goes down you control when you pay it off theres no additional risk because it is your mortgage you have already
2675996 its boring theres no excitement whatsoever to paying off debt but it works like a charm
2675997 one of the approaches weve had in the past is make your rrsp contribution but then use the tax refund that you receive and use that to pay down your mortgage more aggressively
2675998 the benefits of starting an rrsp early are significant because of the effects of the compounding interest

2676046 i fell off the horse against frank mir and tonight i got on that stallion and rode it out of town i ve been trying to work on everything every single day to get better i want to be a well rounded fighter and a contender in the ufc im working towards that florian hands huerta first ufc loss in what was piped up as a fight of the year candidate kenny florian moved one step closer to another shot at the ufc lightweight title with a resounding win over sports illustrated cover boy and minnesota native roger huerta those that were expecting a battle between the lightweight divisions two fastest rising stars got what they wanted but the war went soundly in florians favor the mark dellagrotte rained grappler used technical striking and improved wrestling to stifle huerta and continually keep him off balance throughout the bout florian nearly ended things as soon as they started in the opening minute of the first round the boston native caught a huerta body kick and used the momentum to take him down to the mat where he quickly mounted huerta florian began his now well known ground and pound assault but huerta was able to buck florian off and make a fight of things florians success continued into the second where instead of taking huerta down florian used quick footwork to move in and out while picking huerta apart with combinations the third stanza saw florian land a number of strikes on huerta 20 2 1 1 nc early on florian 10 3 landed the second of two standing upkicks followed by a flying knee and a right cross huerta pressed forward and a left hook prompted him to mock florian and let him know that his power was insufficient with his first ufc defeat closing in huerta swung for the fences during the final minutes even catching florian during a few instances but his cause fell short as florian coasted to his biggest career win thus far i didnt know how hard it was to fight roger huerta florian said after the fight i didn t want to get into a brawl with him i wanted to be technical and i think i was able to do that it was tough fighting roger hes such a likable guy but i was very surprised he was very technical with his escapes i definitely have to give him credit

2676053 we need to believe in the power of american diplomacy and we should not believe a military conflict with iran is inevitable

2676076 with lahood we can ensure that incarcerated individuals will respect correctional officers and make for a safer workplace
2676077 our officers believe it is time for a change in the states attorneys office because the current states attorney has not tried cases for correctional officers as diligently as they should be tried thereby putting the officers in harms way the present states attorneys support of our department has dwindled over the years by not prosecuting violent crimes committed against our officers
2676078 these are the individuals who are on the front lines here in peoria they interact daily with murderers rapists and other violent criminals if they receive no support from the states attorney something is terribly wrong i wholeheartedly respect what these people put on the line on a daily basis and know they go the extra mile to protect all of our families as states attorney i intend to go the extra mile to give them the assurance and support that they desperately need

2676090 this monograph begins by examining prewar planning efforts for postwar iraq in order to establish what u s policymakers expected the postwar situation to look like and what their plans were for reconstruction the monograph then examines the role of u s military forces after major combat officially ended on may 1 2003 the analysis covers this period through the end of june 2004 finally the monograph examines civilian efforts at reconstruction after major combat ended focusing on the activities of the coalition provisional authority cpa and its efforts to rebuild structures of governance security forces economic policy and essential services prior to june 28 2004 the day that the cpa dissolved and transferred authority to the interim iraqi government the authors conclude that the u s government was unprepared for the challenges of postwar iraq for three reasons a failure to challenge fundamental assumptions about postwar iraq ineffective interagency coordination and the failure to assign responsibility and resources for providing security in the immediate aftermath of major combat operations
2676091 we are now compelled to resort to the application of proportionate and justifiable force so that peace and order may be restored in north cotabato
2676092 the government forces launched clearing operations in certain villages in north cotabato as a due course for law enforcement
2676093 we are talking to them explaining to them the primacy of the peace process
2676094 i went from what i was doing to this everyday wear and tear of it
2676095 you want them to get every rep you can but youve got to be wise
2676096 he promised us hed be honest and tell us when it was getting bothersome weve got world class trainers that hopefully will get him out here as soon as possible
2676097 kevins one of those kids who makes a lot of good plays and then hell just get twisted up and remind you that hes real young
2676098 i just have to bounce back and right now im bouncing back
2676099 hes got to go out and get bumped around a little bit
2676100 hes got to show us hes consistent and go out and have days when its not sore thats how you gradually get away from that its a tough injury
2676101 there are reports of civilian casualties as well but at this time we cant confirm it
2676102 at least 19 civilians including women and children were killed in this bombardment
2676103 he explained the news to mary who said how about if we do a plot device number twenty six and
2676104 so youre suggesting we look for him against orders catch him cover ourselves with glory and the by the book officers look like idiots
2676105 no were going to follow plot device number thirty eight
2676106 we wait until they beg for our assistance then save the day for now we follow orders
2676107 it was a coincidence sir she responded confidently do you think i would be crazy enough to talked him on my own
2676108 perhaps not you said briggs glancing at jack briggs thought for a moment and narrowed his eyes this isnt plot device number twenty seven is it he asked suspiciously
2676109 the one where my partner gets killed in a drug bust gone wrong and i throw in my badge and go rogue replied jack innocently i dont think so sir
2676110 no not that one countered briggs in a state of some confusion the one where you try and find the gingerbreadman on the sly and make copperfield and me look like idiots
2676111 that would be a twenty nine wouldnt it put in mary who wasnt going to miss out on the fun
2676112 of course it is very important to get an olympic gold but i was very glad to break my own time
2676113 i achieved this result through the support of our people i tried my best and am glad that i managed to win i think i have to thank my parents for this success
2676114 i just wanted to make sure that i did not lag behind the other swimmers
2676115 rokerspalen op stations zijn een goed idee rokers moeten maar bij die palen roken dan hebben anderen er geen last van
2676116 dan kun je net zo goed ook palen gaan plaatsen voor moslims want dat zijn ook mensen die altijd in een hokje geduwd worden
2676117 om even bij de stereotypering en het hokjes denken te blijven moslims hebben bommen bij zich en als ze die laten ontploffen ondervind ik daar schade van als er aparte palen voor rokers komen moeten die er dus ook voor moslims komen
2676118 you put a weight on you grab the bar and you flex the muscles that you want to work as hard as you possibly can so that that muscle sends a nerve passageway to synapses in the brain and then the brain connects the synapses so that it knows exactly what you want to do develop your pectoral muscles
2676119 the battle is not necessarily in the gym its within yourself once you understand that its you against your own body then you must take the necessary steps to win that battle
2676120 my brother paulie would help drag me around to the machines and he would move my legs around and massage my legs as i first started building my upper body because i had no feeling
2676121 when the feeling came back thats when the pain came back when it was numb it was one thing but then when the nerves started regenerating that was excruciatingly painful but i just used my techniques that i had learned to block out the pain and to redirect that pain energy into a positive kind of energy
2676122 i had learned mental techniques on how to manipulate body cells and dna and how to use an unknown energy that surrounded the body to heal itself
2676123 little did i know those techniques were the ones that would help me overcome pain in my bodybuilding and my recovery
2676124 it was no different for me it was just a different contest
2676125 theres nothing you can grab onto nothing you can wrap your arms around theres nothing you can bandage up emotional pain comes from a place that we cant see that we cant feel and that we cant touch
2676126 when youre born youre born into this game called earth you have a purpose and then you have a barrier and then you have your success or failure theres no way you can know success without some sort of failure theres no way to know how far you can go without some degree of pain
2676127 what you imagine is what you are the levels of spiritual mental emotional and physical pain are brought about by ones own agreement or disagreement and one must rise above that you must connect to yourself

2676133 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2676134 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2676135 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2676136 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2676137 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2676138 la cifra positiva fue jalonada por el crecimiento econ mico del pa s as como por el aumento en el consumo de gas
2676139 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2676140 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2676141 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2676230 beijing has invested more effort and more resources into the environment than any other olympic host city before and i think the diversity of measures here that have been taken have been very impressive
2676231 in the areas of particle matter water resources management water quality there is significant room for further development and finally the question is will beijing continue to invest in its public transport infrastructure and i think that will be a big test for the long term impact of the games
2676232 to be honest i did not really feel that great and going into the ready room i started getting these kind of like chills going through my body
2676233 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes

2676239 the water in front of my house is at about one metre we have been trapped here since
2676240 the sewage flowed down highway 101 and entered a storm drain where an estimated 100 gallons of sewage entered the beach
2676241 the spill has now been contained and emergency workers are in the process of cleaning up the spill
2676242 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2676243 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2676244 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate ceasefire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2676245 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2676246 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2676247 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2676248 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2676249 the nature of his injuries were such that in spite of their efforts his life could not be saved
2676250 no matter where he worked or who he worked with he just fit in well with everybody
2676251 there was a civilian convoy in the vicinity and the incident will be investigated
2676252 the death of roberts is being investigated and until we have conclusive results of the investigation i cant give you a definitive statement
2676253 without private security firms it would be impossible to achieve what were achieving here
2676254 private contractors routinely operate within the battle space and they provide essential security to a lot of development and stabilization groups
2676255 i dont know whether they had a legitimate target or not theres going to be an investigation into all of this activity
2676256 we are deeply affected by this loss josh will be greatly missed by his military family
2676257 as task force commander i offer my deepest condolences to the members of joshs family to his fiancee and to his friends and colleagues know that we stand with you in your grief and we will do all we can to help you through the difficult days ahead
2676258 hes a highly devoted young man and very dedicated to human rights issues
2676259 he took a great risk by coming here today but it was very dear to him to come here and highlight the human rights abuses being committed against the tibetan people
2676260 yes theres things that other governments would do different in terms of how they would deal with dissidents and protests but one hopes the olympics will give china the incentive to evolve their own approach in a way that will be very positive in the future
2676261 we want to send a clear message that the truth has to be exposed the reality behind the hosting of the olympic games and the stories that are not being told
2676262 its important to us to showcase the fact there is no freedom in tibet and they are dying as a result of the chinese occupation
2676263 we are pleased to welcome dr glasgow back to batesville and the ob gyn center
2676264 with the addition of dr glasgow the obgyn center will be able to provide more services for our patients
2676265 were going to try to open it up a little more
2676266 i get to enjoy the two things i enjoy most
2676267 i get to work with kids and i enjoy the competition part of it
2676268 im excited about what were going to be able to do here
2676269 were going to go in and put the best team we can on the field and hope to compete immediately
2676270 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2676271 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2676272 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2676273 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2676274 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2676275 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2676276 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2676277 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2676278 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2676279 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got like these cold chills
2676280 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2676281 i was very nervous today as its been very difficult for my people
2676282 it was nice of natalia to come up to me afterwards and give me an embrace
2676283 its probably going to be the most watched game in the history of the world
2676284 its going to send a lot of chills through my body just to be there and be part of it
2676285 ich habe gesagt ach du meine g te und meine frau sagt darauf
2676286 bei personen die ein geringes einkommen haben ist eine einkommenssteigerung etwas ganz wichtiges und erh ht die lebenszufriedenheit stark das gleiche gilt f r arme l nder wenn deren durchschnittseinkommen steigt nimmt auch deren lebenszufriedenheit deutlich zu
2676287 wir mussten horten um zu berleben wer am meisten zusammengesammelt hatte hatte die beste chance den n chsten winter zu berstehen das haben wir ber unsere ganze geschichte gelernt
2676288 doch jeder meint noch immer wenn ich mehr und mehr besitze dann ist das f r mein berleben und mein gl ck notwendig

2676296 we have deer and foxes and opossums and all other creatures
2676297 when they get to be a year and a half old the young males and females are essentially kicked out of that family and the males will continue to travel until they reach an area where there are no other bears
2676298 its essentially moving like a bear trying to get away from people
2676299 what were really relying on is that people will not do behaviors that will attract the bear
2676300 the only time we have a conflict with people and bears is when the bear is afforded the opportunity to become complacent
2676301 the bear will leave in almost every case before you do anything when it sees you or smells you it will try to get away from you
2676302 its not like were going to keep the kids indoors forever well keep our eye out
2676303 we were all strangers when we started but we became friends
2676304 ive taken some of them to doctors or to the hospital theres not a one of them that wouldnt do the same for you
2676305 but you have to go into all the little nooks and crannies
2676306 i think this is an incredible two week experience and its real world engineering
2676307 he has really grown in terms of maturity in how he speaks
2676308 when i first got here i was a nervous wreck
2676309 no one wanted to declare a moratorium but it was the responsible thing to do
2676310 i think that so far most people are happy to see a building moratorium
2676311 people are very concerned because we have been saying for years that the system is over taxed
2676312 the feeling has been in the neighborhood for a long time that people have been given permits improperly
2676313 wont just make the lot unattractive it will make it useless
2676314 we had not been told that the facility was getting to its maximum point
2676315 that there could be a potential stoppage of permits in that area
2676316 its those property owners that had plans to build a house
2676317 falta una copia de los pasaportes de los ni os debes sacar una y luego d rmela para que las lleve otra vez al ayuntamiento
2676318 ante esa situaci n procuren tener a mano sus papeles y pasaportes es lo mas importante que deben salvar
2676319 al principio cuesta convencer a los padres que sus hijos tienen que ir a la escuela para ellos un hijo representa una fuente m s de ingreso y por eso tampoco controlan la natalidad
2676320 la marginaci n en las escuelas es uno de los inconvenientes especialmente cuando los ni os van sucios o son violentos en algunas los han recibido bien pero en otras les han puesto pegas
2676321 la gente cree que porque los ni os est n en la carretera pidiendo limosna s lo est n ah para robar los rechazan y tienen miedo de ellos los medios de comunicaci n han hecho que la sociedad los estigmatice como peligrosos

2676328 eventually darwin came to the conclusion that the experimental basis was not good enough both beddoe and darwin came to the conclusion that the original results were misleading and didnt make sufficient allowance for the darkening of hair with age
2676329 me parece muy bien que dos autonom as como la comunidad y catalu a hagan fuerza conjunta en favor de los intereses de los ciudadanos en lugar de pelear

2676337 bienvenido a la radio sin fronteras de pek n una emisora de radio creada por la organizaci n que defiende la prensa reporteros sin fronteras para informarles sobre la libertad de expresi n en china
2676338 la mejor burla a las autoridades chinas que tienen a n a decenas y decenas de periodistas y de internautas encarcelados
2676339 a pesar de todo hay gente que podr hacerles escuchar aquello que ustedes quieren entender en pleno coraz n de pek n
2676340 nos han prohibido ir a pek n nos han expulsado de china pero estamos aqu y nos hacemos escuchar pac ficamente sin violencia es una manera de decir que la censura no funciona
2676341 es desde un esp ritu de resistencia al control de los medios de comunicaci n como reporteros sin fronteras ha concebido esta acci n
2676342 no estatal en china desde la llegada del partido comunista al poder en 1949
2676343 s lo las radios internacionales en chino que emiten en onda corta pueden romper el monopolio de la informaci n pero son interferidas por las autoridades
2676344 queremos mostrar a los millones de personas que van a mirar la ceremonia de apertura de los juegos ol mpicos y a los cientos de atletas que en el t bet no existen los derechos humanos
2676345 creemos con firmeza que las sociedades que permiten la libertad de expresi n tienden a ser m s pr speras y m s pac ficas
2676346 the best medicine for bad religion is not no religion but good religion
2676347 we did a voluminous amount of research not only on brett as a player but also as a person and made sure we thought he could fit in in the locker room we were extremely comfortable about just what he did on the field but just as importantly what he is off the field and what he stands for
2676348 we dont know what to make of favre trade either
2676349 wait he publicly demanded respect from his management just like i did but i got branded a villain and hes still a hero and i never actually walked away from the sport like he did and the commissioner never tried to step in to mediate with me what am i missing here
2676350 gave everything you had including that long teary retirement speech
2676351 sort of the way the packers were when they refused to release me or honestly trade me to a willing partner
2676352 i changed my mind now unlock the door and let me back in
2676353 buat apa saya membayar mahal mahal sekolah bila anak saya tidak diajar dengan becus
2676354 apa betul kita sebagai bangsa selama ini telah mendapat pendidikan dalam arti kata yang sebenarnya
2676355 logikanya makin tinggi tingkat pendidikan seseorang maka makin tinggi pula peran yang dapat dimainkannya dalam kehidupan di masyarakat
2676356 the ones first offense back on the field the offense decided not to come to practice today
2676357 is it christmas with all of these gifts were getting today
2676358 from the epilepsy the injuries to being blamed for something that wasnt his fault giving up a long touchdown to carolinas steve smith hes got such great character
2676359 from the time ive gotten here bisciottis been very supportive of different types of situations i guess it shows everybody what type of owner he is and more so what type of person he is
2676360 at any point in time people can just lay it down and say its too much i cant take it i dont want to deal with this anymore
2676361 he could have done that last year when he was going through his own personal issues
2676362 he didnt the guys got a huge heart a tremendous will to make the best out of life hes one of those guys that keeps going
2676363 if we can get a full year when hes healthy and running around itd help a lot
2676364 hes like a regular guy hes stern but at the same time theres no talking down to you hes just talking to you like one of the guys hes been very supportive the whole time
2676365 he did as good as he could do and were expecting him to do a whole lot better the next game
2676366 it was interesting at the conditioning level we really wanted to play him the whole game but we didnt do it
2676367 theres a lot of work to be done both in the technical and mental aspects of the game but thats what practice is for
2676368 i didnt even know what to expect i just went in there open minded and having my mind focused on my technique see how my body was going to react
2676369 i just followed the calls we made and i played
2676370 the differences are just maybe in the words thats the biggest thing
2676371 i just try to approach the game the same way and thats just to get better i dont worry about depth charts or anything
2676372 i went dropping back and the guard actually chased me out on a pass play
2676373 i dont really know what he was doing but they ended up calling a flag on something else anyway
2676374 the state of massachusetts has asked a federal judge for a temporary restraining order preventing three mit students from giving a presentation on sunday about hacking smartcards used in the boston subway system
2676375 in what seems to be a repeat of what happened in july a few news sites have mentioned that there is evidence of a campaign against georgia
2676376 i think we should focus on how to do well at this olympics because the beijing games has been a dream for us all
2676377 we are hard workers and we just want the best for our teammates on every team thats huge we got all the roles well covered and were all looking for just one simple goal
2676378 ive been meaning to write about my new bike a fixed gear for months now im in paris and im enjoying the parisians more relaxed attitude to cycling and wondering why london cycling is so frantic
2676379 that a nursing home owner was actually arrested and charged with a felony for not paying workers compensation insurance
2676380 an act to amend the civil service law in relation to independent hearing officers for disciplinary hearings
2676381 it was the book hes been looking for all his life
2676382 going it alone with his sister at a time when he is clearly incapable of caring for her and society as a whole cannot support those who turn their back on it
2676383 the gorkhaland demand is purely a matter between the west bengal government and the central government we have nothing to say on this and we should not be unnecessarily harassed in the event
2676384 the state suffers a loss of rs 3 crore 7 lakhs every day whenever the nh31a is forced closed
2676385 the state government has also plans to set up a lepcha museum near the structure of the stairway he added
2676386 peacekeepers posts monitor the presence of georgian forces artillery and armour
2676387 i was looking at my schedule and wondering what kind of work id get done during those two weeks
2676388 the olympics is kind of a holiday in our house we love it and we try to watch as much coverage as we can then it hit me what if my work for those two weeks became connected to the games
2676389 though i may work on the prologue before the games begin after that ill be doing one chapter of the story each day each chapter will be at least 1000 words long so at the end of the olympiad ill have at minimum a decent sized novella
2676390 i have an idea of where im going with the story
2676391 and i have a few characters in mind but theres nothing set in stone inspiration for writing can come from a lot of places i know watching the olympics will really get the creative juices flowing im also interested in feedback on the concept from my readers theyll be able to comment on my blog and send messages through my email once the story gets running ill have some lists of characters for people to vote on too
2676392 if i dont work i dont get paid so its risky for me to devote a couple of weeks to something like this im hoping the readers will support me in this experiment and if they do ill write them into the story
2676393 there will be bronze silver and gold levels of participation there will be a spectator level too for small donations with participants listed on the web site finally there will be a champion level where the donor will actually be written into the story as a contestant though i wont promise that anyone written into the story will survive
2676394 though i have a small publishing house of my own walkabout publishing i will be pursuing all printing options
2676395 one way or another tournament of death will be available in print and at amazon after its done itd be nice if a big publisher picks it up well just have to see what the reaction is
2676396 theres always that possibility since this is a live event its going to be like walking a tightrope not a lot of room for error i hope people will tune in and see how i do
2676397 jika teknik teknik yang disajikan dalam buku ini terbukti bermanfaat bagi pembaca dan membuat pekerjaan pembaca sebagai guru menjadi lebih efisien dan menyenangkan maka yang perlu pembaca lakukan adalah menularkan
2676398 pikirkan suatu hal yang dapat mengubah dunia dan lakukan think of something to change the world and put it into action
2676399 if he is out of the picture weapons of mass destruction capability has been set back which would make this one of the more effective strikes in recent years
2676400 i believe that al qaeda has no shortage of people adept with explosives and i know that al masri promulgated training manuals for poisons but im not sure how skilled any of proteges may be at synthesizing chemical weapons or toxins
2676401 im concerned we are watching our nations ice breaking capabilities decline
2676402 we are in a five nation race for the arctic and right now we are running fifth
2676403 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2676404 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them
2676405 obviously it turns a defining element of his biography his reputation as a devoted family man upside down
2676406 but if he shows a continued commitment to his core issues and no additional facts emerge that contradict his story he could eventually join the disturbingly large club of public figures whove rebounded from similar events
2676407 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2676408 made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2676409 he has been driven to be outspoken by the appalling prospect of his silence in the wake of worsening chinese repression
2676410 were trying to make it clear that they need to step it up
2676411 im glad that im healthy enough to really see this i would never imagine it
2676412 it was barely barely enough for basic food the end of the month wed run out of money
2676413 every other leader met with president hu jintao shook his hand only president bush patted him on the back

2676524 the valet service was 20 or 30 a little expensive but it was a hot hot day so i pulled in there when i left the luncheon i was pulled aside and told that there had been an accident and there was some damage to the car
2676525 i wanted them to call the repair shop and discuss costs but they were adamant about sticking by their estimate
2676526 i dont want to have the body shop open up the car and have them start the work and then get denied by towne park for the entire cost of the work
2676527 if it was just a couple hundred dollars i would have worked with them but its a lot more than that

2676538 i really enjoy what i do when i see good teaching if you can teach those young children thats the foundation
2676539 i think now more and more educators are beginning to realize that those early years are the most important years
2676540 thats a big change and that will help a lot of people

2676561 we didnt want the anger to lead to any untoward incident so far ive not received any report on threat to security or disturbance to public order

2676567 what i feel need to be done is to explain to the people what islam is all about i think we can come to discuss instead of shouting that is not the way i am unhappy with it because it gives islam a bad name

2676590 the georgian government committed a crime against their own people when they invaded south ossetia the actions of russia are firmly based in international law and legitimate russia shall always have enormous respect for the fraternal georgian people in spite of the criminal policy of the present government i am confident in spite of the tragedy that we see today that this relationship shall continue in the future notwithstanding the criminal policy of the present rulers of georgia
2676591 they drove them in like cattle shut them up in the house and set it on fire we saw a tank run over an old baba that was running together with two kids we saw a body of one of the kids crushed into the earth
2676592 this is nothing but madness civilised people do not behave like this
2676593 ossetians shall not be defeated and we shall fight until the end
2676594 have no doubts we are going to return and we are going to rebuild our city
2676595 the task facing us is to ameliorate the consequences of this human tragedy in this case those officials who created these conditions must bear complete responsibility for their actions including the violations of international law that are involved
2676596 immediately end its invasion of south ossetia to cease violating all previous peace agreements and ceasefires and respect the inherent rights and interests of all the peoples in the region
2676597 i gave a proposal to russian president dmitri medvedev to stop this madness
2676598 it seems to us that this proposal would be completely logical if it proceeded from the georgian president but there must be a strict adherence to two preliminary conditions firstly all georgian forces must withdraw from the conflict zone secondly georgia must immediately conclude a nonaggression pact with south ossetia
2676599 only if they did this would we be able to talk about the future
2676600 the results of the premeditated and accomplished barbarities of the georgian leadership resulted in thousands of human victims tens of thousands of refugees mass destruction and in fact the denial of the right to life of an entire people
2676601 its total genocide this is nothing but madness civilised people do not behave like this
2676602 the task facing us is to ameliorate the consequences of this human tragedy in this case those officials who created these conditions must bear complete responsibility for their actions including the violations of international law that are involved

2676607 at the moment hes going to be out there and battle through it
2676608 i watch him a lot not so much how he goes about throwing to hitters but about how he approaches the game
2676609 the way he fields his position manages the game who he throws to who he doesnt the inner workings
2676610 i need every advantage i can get and hes been one of the best pitchers in this game for a long time so he knows what hes doing
2676611 when hes pitching im watching him any time hes throwing ill be in the front row
2676612 hes earned at least a months worth of triple a at bats
2676613 he hit in the middle of the order in midland he played all three outfield positions he really had quality at bats

2676640 after inspecting the stadium in the indian capital on sunday afc decided to shift both the matches to ambedkar stadium now the final between hosts india and defending champions tajikistan will be played at 1900 hours preceded by the third place playoff between dpr korea and myanmar at 1600 hours
2676641 the shift in the venue was necessitated after incessant rains in hyderabad turned the ground unplayable
2676642 we have three options now first it may be played tomorrow as scheduled either at the gachibowli stadium or lal bahadur stadium here the second option is to shift the venue to another city and play within a week the last option is to postpone the game for a month or two
2676643 the ground at gachibowli was unplayable the match then will not be decided by football skills it will be a shame if a final match of such an important tournament is decided by factors not connected to football
2676644 lal bahadur stadium was no better than gachibowli it will be an embarrassment for the afc and aiff if the final is played at lbs which is a cricket ground
2676645 i dont know which place we would like to play with rain everywhere in the country but dont tell me kolkata

2676664 one man who comes in quite often lives in the woods in harford county
2676665 i didnt think that in this day and age there could be people in such situations
2676666 we have one man who comes by and he refuses to take the clothing for free

2676671 this is a form of intervention into the nations sovereignty
2676672 im a former county agent with university of maryland cooperative extension im looking at disputes from a different perspective i look at them from the perspective of a retired dairy farmer
2676673 there are no winners in agriculture when a disagreement goes to court
2676674 the time and cost associated with lawsuits and litigation strain everyones resources and often result in outcomes that satisfy no one
2676675 we hope farm operators and their nonfarm off farm neighbors will try our mediation service before a situation becomes unbearable or goes to court
2676676 in coming weeks i will be meeting with judges the judges dont know about it
2676677 i will be meeting with the maryland farm bureau the maryland bar association the realtors association and the association of counties
2676678 farmers are the first important part in the chain of food production and these usda matching grants support new and practical links from farm to market
2676679 i love the idea of taking something society had thrown out
2676680 its nice to be able to bring out the beautiful from what society thinks is ugly
2676681 we were a group of women using refuse to make beauty
2676682 we use all sorts of things to make our art
2676683 the kids know me at some of the schools and thats very gratifying for me
2676684 what we do is almost a metaphor for human potential
2676685 the harford county public school system is indeed fortunate to have someone with the experience and the impressive ability of teri kranefeld to lead the communications office to the next level of service
2676686 during her three years of increasing responsibility in providing communications services for the school system she has proven her value to the system and earned the respect of those with whom she has worked
2676687 the field of communications has evolved so rapidly over the past decade due to emerging technology and the publics ever increasing demand for information changing the way we must communicate with our students parents staff and community
2676688 as the county continues to grow attracting more young families i look forward to reaching out and engaging the community in dialogue in order to increase parental and community involvement with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement in a positive way

2676693 but to surplus them now at a time when we desperately need space would not be prudent
2676694 i am deeply troubled that we are even entertaining the idea of surplusing when we have debated at length the need for space
2676695 if it is too costly for us to renovate because of age and condition i cannot imagine it would be cost effective for a private developer
2676696 it makes no sense to sell this off and then go look for space
2676697 then we would be glad to take the real estate i dont understand the councils position why do they want to continue to own old buildings
2676698 its a great location but if you have to build within those walls it is better to let a private developer do it and get it back on the tax rolls
2676699 all the infrastructure in these buildings is below todays usage standards
2676700 the buildings are narrow and not accessible we cannot put anyone on the second floor the bathrooms are inadequate in one the previous tenants could not use the air conditioning and computers at the same time
2676701 by the time we did all the upgrades you might have 6 000 square feet in all and it would come at a tremendous cost
2676702 when i heard the statistics i thought with those statistics children arent safe
2676703 i felt that more needed to be done to bring the statistics out in the open
2676704 i felt that we needed to get people to look at what happens once children are manipulated and sexually abused
2676705 raising awareness is the only way to stop sexual abuse
2676706 and the problem is that most people want to ignore the topic but until our society recognizes child sexual abuse as a public health crisis we will never be able to stop it
2676707 people have this impression that some man on the corner in a trench coat is going to grab their child and molest them
2676708 but 95 percent of all sexually abused children are abused by someone the family knows and cares about
2676709 that medley relay is the toughest part to get a part of and to be part of that team would be awesome
2676710 all i wanted to get out of that semi final was to get through to the final
2676711 its going to be tough and i just want to do a personal best in the end
2676712 i have come here to win medals and do great times with the best swimmers in the world
2676713 were holding up reasonably well at noon considering the weak start weve had and westpac doing well after it released some positive results today mr betts said referring to westpacs market update this morning

2676722 consumers may be cutting back in terms of discretionary spending but they are not about to send their kids to school without the necessities
2676723 consumers are clearly shifting to value and one stop shop channels as they seek to optimize shopping trips
2676724 retailers at risk this back to school season are the specialty retailers such as office supply stores where distinct trips are needed and apparel retailers which are heavily skewed to discretionary spending
2676725 consumers recognize that retail prices tend to fall the closer we get to the first day of school
2676726 stung by high gas and food prices many consumers will likely hold out as long as possible waiting for retailers to drop prices on items kids need for the new school year

2676736 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2676737 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2676738 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2676739 le premier soir jeudi cela allait encore mais hier vendredi soir tout a d g n r laction n tait absolument pas pr par e et coordonn e il y avait beaucoup trop peu de matelas quelque 180 pour les pr s de 300 occupants ce qui a t lorigine dagressions verbales voire presque physiques
2676740 une action men e dans de telles conditions ne peut que mal se terminer et ne peut qu tre mauvaise pour eux et pour tout le mouvement cest pourquoi je leur ai clairement fait comprendre quils devaient quitter l glise aujourdhui avant 12h00
2676741 elle est arriv e ici entre 16h00 et 17h00 et est calmement entr e en contact avec ces gens
2676742 a la vue des policiers le plus grand groupe restant est galement sorti mais une dizaine ont grimp dans les chafaudages les agents les ont suivis et leur ont clairement indiqu s que sils ne quittaient pas l glise ils seraient appr hend s ceux ne disposant pas de papiers didentit couraient videmment le risque de se retrouver dans un centre ferm
2676743 jai pr vu de revoir ces gens dans 15 jours afin de voir quelles actions pouvaient ventuellement tre entreprises
2676744 je continue soutenir les demandeurs dasile et je veux encore faire quelque chose pour ce groupe de personnes mais cela ne peut se d rouler dans les m mes conditions que ces trois derniers jours

2676746 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2676747 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2676748 unless otherwise specifically provided in the constitution a member of the peoples majlis shall not continue to hold office in the cabinet of ministers the office of state minister deputy minister
2676749 four ministers have submitted their resignations because they want to continue with their businesses there is no other reason
2676750 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2676751 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2676752 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2676754 right now the joint ceasefire committee is thrashing things out so the arrangement can push through but until that is thrashed out there will be tensions because the military is continuing to open fire

2676757 despite good fundamentals we have been unable to insulate ourselves from sector developments indeed the second quarter was clearly weaker than the previous year the latter part of the year also seems difficult and the operational result for the second half of the year might dip into the red
2676758 high fuel prices and a trend towards lower ticket prices have been unsettling developments for airlines the overcapacity in the market has not allowed ticket prices to rise in parallel with costs the coming cost cutting programmes in the sector will be so severe that in countries where airlines collapse there may be demands for flight connections to be maintained for business needs using state funds
2676759 the situation in the sector may remain extremely difficult due to expensive fuel and uncertain development of demand in the second half of the year fuel costs are expected to account for around 28 per cent of finnairs turnover whereas last year the jet fuel bill accounted for a fifth of turnover
2676760 in punctuality we are again among the best of european airlines moreover the amount of baggage delays has also fallen to a third of last summers total
2676761 vlm airlines is honoured to receive this recognition the awards are a powerful acknowledgement of our ongoing growth in the business travel sector and the premium services we provide our customers vlm airlines is dedicated to providing the highest levels of service and is continually striving to set new standards in the airline industry
2676762 i just found my way on base and we put on a good hit and run that happened to work out for us
2676763 it was just a bunch of little things we did a lot of little things well that helped us stay in the game
2676764 it didnt seem like it fazed him at all to be in that situation
2676765 chad bradford shows up goes 40 pitches and gets a win i give chad a lot of credit in that moment
2676766 there was some ugly things and there were some great things
2676767 theres a lot of positives to draw from as we lose these tough ones like that and that ones just about as bad as they get but that aint a hell of a lot different than several others weve had just like that

2676771 to live is to pray an introduction to carmelite spirituality
2676772 what happened to them in the sixth inning happens to every team at least twice a year
2676773 ive got to give my team mates credit they really helped me
2676774 the boy in the sea the girl on the beach
2676775 i am fine missing a start is news to me
2676776 i feel great no one has ever discussed missing a start with me i am pitching i have not discussed missing a start with anybody
2676777 the issue will likely keep the lefthander from taking the mound on sunday in anaheim
2676778 we cant dwell on injuries we need to find a way to win
2676779 its a sigh of relief just to be in the game and make some big plays for this team
2676780 thats what im supposed to do thats why they put me out there
2676781 was an example of some of the things he can do
2676782 and when the opportunity comes again try to go up there and make a play again
2676783 but hey things happen when the ball is up in the air you have to go up and get it
2676784 he held off the defender a little bit by jumping up to catch the ball
2676785 it was a good job by him to do what he did
2676786 its my job man im really not impressed with it
2676787 thats what im supposed to do actually its really behind me now that was the other night im not worried about that right now i have to press on for this week and get ready for next weeks game
2676788 this constitution i believe is going to be the foundation stone of the actual reforms it may not sort out all the problems in the country but it will give an opportunity to address them and also it empowers the public in a way we have never seen in this country it has also diminished the power of the executive quite tremendously i have a feeling expectations are very high now but the constitution may not deliver all of them as its only a means to address them and not an end by itself we need to work together for a better future for which we have an ideal platform to debate and deliberate
2676789 we couldnt have acquired probably a better player than what hes doing for us right now
2676790 oh precious soul mine oh come back hope oh come back ambition oh come back self come back come back
2676791 i got there and i guess no one really knew i was coming
2676792 charlie samuels didnt really get much notice i guess i dont know if he got the word late or whatever so i just found my locker put my uniform on and went out there
2676793 were calling him buck and he doesnt know why yet
2676794 he said they were starting to get some letters and calls from people who didnt like the fact i was sporting willie mays number
2676795 so they just gave me no 39 but shoot it didnt matter to me what number i wore i could have worn 1 8th or 2 4 i would have been totally happy i just wanted to be there
2676796 that was back when nobody went from japan to the united states
2676797 i remember watching this kid play and thinking what a shame because this kid could play in the big leagues the only thing he couldnt do was throw obviously his arm has gotten a lot better but you could tell he was special at 18
2676798 well probably evaluate him after three or four games and see where hes at speed up the process slow it down whatever
2676799 just watching him take bp hes swinging the bat tremendously well but baseball is a game youve got to play you cant just try to get into shape and say im ready to go play in the major leagues youve got to play the game in order to get your rhythm and your timing its a different adrenaline when youre practicing rather than playing baseball
2676800 contrary to what you all are reporting about our minor leagues our minor leagues are in much better shape than whats being reported
2676801 im just trying to stay within myself tonight and last night felt a lot more comfortable
2676802 molta gente non si rende conto di quanto possano essere pericolose le bombe e gli esplosivi
2676803 e come possano nuocere gravemente allambiente tnt e rdx generano gas tossici che inquinano lambiente quando esplodono e anche le bombe inesplose sono altamente tossiche possono rilasciare dannose forme di carbone che avvelenano il terreno e contaminano chi le maneggia tuttavia siamo convinti di avere risolto questo problema creando un nuovo e pi sicuro tipo di bombe basate su una classe di materiali recentemente sviluppati i tetrazoli che derivano gran parte della loro energia esplosiva dal nitrogeno invece che dal carbone quindi sono molto migliori per la salvaguardia dellambiente coi tetrazoli abbiamo gi fabbricato piccole bombe chiamate hbt e g2zt che non soltanto sono pi stabili e meno tossiche rispetto agli esplosivi tradizionali ma anche pi potenti e vero generano acido cianidrico cianuro di idrogeno ndmw ma stiamo lavorando su questo problema e ci aspettiamo di avere presto una gamma di esplosivi completamente sicuri e ambientalisti progettati specificamente per grossi calibri navali e di carri armati
2676804 as you have never being admitted in a hospital why not do something and get admitted in a hospital
2676805 that said it is also a rule of democracy that a country or an elected legislature of the country or its people must be able to decide the course that country shall take
2676806 its amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper
2676807 what do you think you think its fun watching that crap no what a silly question
2676808 they were just up they just didnt hit their spots today
2676809 the relievers today did not do a very good job
2676810 the relievers were up a little bit just up those guys have been doing very good all year long today was a bad day
2676811 weve got to win man weve got to win games weve got to start doing things to win games we have all the talent in the world here
2676812 did the jets have to get the approval of fireman ed before this trade could be made
2676813 my neighbor a jets fan was waiting for a tv repairman because his tv was on the fritz i told him not to bother his tv wasnt broken brett favre is a jet
2676814 with a busy offseason i guess jets management wasnt able to get a chance to see the new madden 09 cover
2676815 one thing about that brett favre he looks good in green
2676816 if brett favre is confused about retirement im sure playing for the jets will put him over the edge
2676817 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my jets quarterback
2676818 im just not real upset about it im just going to move on ive already done that
2676819 its the first bad outing ive had in a long time im not going to look much into it
2676820 i dont have any comment on the comments thats not the right thing to do
2676821 some guys understand how to handle the media a little bit better than others
2676822 when you play in new york not only is it a learning process on how to play in new york i think its also a learning process on how to say exactly what you mean i can tell you the results bothered him
2676823 it would be very hard to have an entire pitching career without having some strain in the elbow or shoulder that would require rest
2676824 its inevitable and it doesnt mean anybody did anything wrong
2676825 and i dont think you can extrapolate that to joba chamberlain
2676826 they dont have much more giddy up the fatigue factor in the cuff is not all about numbers its about how long you can generate that much power and keep going for it
2676827 in those bygone years you had to learn how to pitch change speeds
2676828 now you come up throw 97 miles per hour to overpower people but the problem is youre not only overpowering batters youre overpowering yourself
2676829 you didnt get an mri you just got a shot of painkiller and toughed it out and when you couldnt do it anymore you retired like sandy koufax i doubt anything was really different then except those cultural factors the mri has changed sports medicine radically
2676830 is common sense a pitcher gets tired and his mechanics begin to subtly change and in throwing thats a really really big deal thats when you start to strain things
2676831 without doctors baseball figured that out the managers and the pitching coaches it wasnt a doctor who said you have to have five days of rest and be limited to so many pitches
2676832 i felt like i was a kid or something out there
2676833 all those times goofing around in my front yard i always imagined myself pitching here
2676834 i think hell be happy anyway because of the way he pitched
2676835 to pitch here was his childhood dream come true well one of them anyway
2676836 he did what i was looking for and what joe girardi was looking for
2676837 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
2676838 this is the first time i put on pads since the giants game
2676839 the next day theres a hall of famer in our locker room
2676840 ive been an offensive player my whole life and to go to a team and hear those things im just why the heck did you get me it was a tough year in that regard but its how i bounce back
2676841 youve got to make the coach look down and see your number and put you back out there
2676842 i dont care if youre 37 or 25 i still have it in me i still have the fever to compete at a high level
2676843 i think when you have a lot of young guys you can go two directions
2676844 you can wait for everybody else to do it or we can come in and instill confidence in these kids and expect a lot of them and breed that attitude that were gonna win every game
2676845 i know what doug can do i know his abilities and how he can help our team
2676846 look at our power play last year it struggled at times and doug is the guy who can change that with the addition of him and mark streit our power play is immediately better
2676847 im not going to sit here and tell you that i have this offense down that i know every guy in the locker room that they know me or the routine
2676848 there are some things as a coach you dont want to coach him out of a good play you dont want to outcoach a guys instincts
2676849 there were some times in practice today i was wondering if i made the right move
2676850 i knew it would be rough today i would try to go through every rep and learn the offense in one day the bottom line is its still football this is the tough stuff you have to go through
2676851 all of the rumors about him throwing hard theyre true
2676852 he has a lot more touch than people would think on the ball
2676853 he can make all types of throws thats why he is who he is
2676854 im not surprised by the response of the fans its great
2676855 i could say that for a lot of years as i said yesterday and the day before my intentions are to help this team win i cant make any guarantees im not going to make any guarantees all i can say is ill do my best and hopefully thats enough
2676856 obviously he has a busy schedule him quarterbacks coach brian daboll and offensive coordinator brian schottenheimer have been spending a lot of time together and well take it in chunks i think its very realistic for him to be able to learn what he needs to know
2676857 serious lapse in that some of the arrangements discussed and agreed to in advance did not get implemented on the ground
2676858 was immediately discussed with sri lankan security authorities and remedial measures taken jointly sri lankan security authorities have apologised to mr narayanan
2676859 we have now agreed that we are in the first half of the third decade of saarc and that the third must be the decade of implementation decade of business and decade of productivity in terms of regional cooperation
2676860 this spirit of cooperation understanding and certainly the growing realisation that we must work together that saarc must succeed has prevailed throughout
2676861 india is deeply committed to this process pakistan is clearly interested in seeing saarc succeed bangladesh has so much to gain from this and sri lankas interest in the success of saarc is evident in the way they have hosted this event afghanistan who is interested and just joined has great expectations in terms of what saarc could offer and we are committed
2676862 terrorism is on the top of the agenda mainly because there was no country in our sub region which does not suffer from the problem of terrorism bhutan is the most peaceful country but even in bhutan we had fourteen bomb explosions in recent times
2676863 it just occurred to me there should be a scout group on facebook it was a bit tongue in cheek to start with it was never meant to have the impact it has
2676864 its like a comfort thing im going to university in october and it will be difficult to stay in touch so it will allow me to keep up with scouting i dont want travel and time restraints to be a problem
2676865 if i see anyone wearing the necker scarf then we stop and talk its a chance to meet people from all over the country as well as other countries and learn about their culture
2676866 if i didnt come to scouts i wouldnt have met all the people i have ive met different people americans swedish nigerians and germans
2676867 we are all scouts were all the same were equal
2676868 im sure baden powell would have loved the idea its all about what he started the movement for its just what scouting is about its about making friends
2676869 i can throw it through a wall but i dont win every game ive ever played in hes very effective i havent seen one person say anything negative about him hes a high character guy a lot of class id just like to beat him
2676870 theyre throwing everything at me and im trying to digest it
2676871 its a little overwhelming i was really surprised i was as effective as i was i was able to call a play break the huddle and i was able to complete passes
2676872 i was probably overly excited the first part of practice and im going to pay for it tomorrow
2676873 i feel rough im two weeks behind as far as practice is concerned im also 38 years old so im behind there
2676874 there were times in practice i was wondering if i made the right move
2676875 i hope at the end of the season that i feel like i made the right decision and jets fans and people throughout the nfl world think i made the right decision
2676876 at this point i think it was the right decision all i can say is ill do my best and hopefully thats enough

2676879 during a stay in makkah my hair had grown long but i could not afford to cut it i went to a barber who seemed to be a good man and asked him
2676880 its survival of the fittest people encroach in protected areas or poach wild animals when they are pushed to do that abdul rehman villager
2676881 politics may not be in support of wildlife conservation since wildlife cannot cast votes
2676882 of late i have heard from some sources that there is some objections to the declaring of the kazi tiger reserve just because areas like laokhowa burachapori has been included within the limit of the tiger reserve
2676883 we are not doing this as an illusion but for the benefit of the country
2676884 the real work is bringing the constitution into effect democracy can bind everyone together even if we are different from one another
2676885 it might bring some good changes i have seen this man gayoom ever since i was born its time to bring a change
2676886 the new constitution says we can get freedoms but we dont feel it now maybe electing a new president will give us the freedoms in reality
2676887 it lays the groundwork for a new era providing of course the constitution is implemented in the spirit it is intended to be
2676888 but we still want to see how it is implemented because we do need to see the composition of the election commission and supreme court
2676889 thousands of bangladeshi workers in the maldives are passing days in deep frustration as they are yet to get any job
2676890 there was nothing in the service contact of al amin when he came here five months ago where he will work who will take back his dead body if he dies
2676891 in most cases workers come here on tourist visas and therefore they cannot manage any job as promised by their middlemen
2676892 i do not understand how the authorities allow a worker wearing sandal and torn cloths to leave the airport on tourist visa
2676893 there is a nexus between the middlemen in bangladesh and the maldives these people bring workers showing false job assurance
2676894 i spent about tk 1 6 lakh and the middleman assured me of a nice job with a salary of tk 30 000 a month but after waiting for several months i got a construction related job with only tk 5 000 salary
2676895 nothing attracted us in the maldives the deep blue sea or anything every friday we would gather in a park and share our sorrows
2676896 i used to earn tk 7 8 thousand per month in the maldives working at least 16 hours a day with a one hour lunch break
2676897 we could not ensure our workers their rights and interests due to the lack of attention of the government authorities concerned dishonest recruiting agencies and middlemen just take this opportunity
2676898 what this rotting country needs is a chemotherapy with the radioactive beams of fascism
2676899 the ministers will resign tomorrow because their businesses cannot function without them it may be because they are family businesses
2676900 it is quite clear that we will have to decide between business and politics
2676901 during a stay in makkah my hair had grown long but i could not afford to cut it i went to a barber who seemed to be a good man and asked him
2676902 this would leave her with no choice but to end her life
2676903 i do think it is legitimate to report on rape and coercion being used to encourage female suicide bombing when tactics like that are being used
2676904 also male suicide bomber recruitment tactics should be discussed alongside
2676905 it is wrong for a person to accuse anyone else of something wrong except with full knowledge and tangible proof
2676906 and when you speak then be just though it be against a relative
2676907 o you who believe if a wicked person comes to you with any news ascertain the truth lest you harm people unwittingly and afterwards become full of repentance for what you have done
2676908 o you who believe shun much suspicion for lo some suspicion is a sin
2676909 baby all i ever want is you if you love me we can work this out i might have hurt you unknowingly somehow made a mistake i should have never let you go at the first place please dont give up on me no ones perfect love let make this work hold my hand give me a chance

2676912 teachers are deciding to come to school and teach but only not to mark the exam papers when the exams are over they decided to do this because recently the ministry declared that their salaries would not be increased
2676913 police had no hesitation in trumping up accusations against journalists
2676914 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province
2676915 issues with the structure and scope of the new government are likely to take centre stage
2676916 it is understood that the negotiators have agreed on a number of issues that include land and sanctions while there are issues that they felt should be dealt with by the principals
2676917 the negotiators have reached common ground on the land issue sovereignty non interference freedom of assembly and association and sanctions
2676918 the dow jones was up over 300 points and that sets up a good day for our market in a broader sense although there are going to be a raft of winners and losers
2676919 the oil price being down us5 a barrel is certainly going to weigh down the energy sector although banks should continue to do well
2676920 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2676921 the absence of our great poet mahmud darwish the love of palestine and the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2676922 darwish is the essential breath of the palestinian people the eloquent witness of exile and belonging
2676923 you just have to be very careful when you go downtown
2676924 they should take care and apply commonsense and also we think they should wear uniforms i certainly dont think we should go downtown in civvies
2676925 the united states olympic committee is saddened to confirm the death of todd bachman father in law of united states olympic mens indoor volleyball head coach hugh mccutcheon

2676932 i was the one who suggested give herbie a kick
2676933 i feel very very bad about it i had no idea and campo gave me the evil eyes when he walked into the dressing shed
2676934 theres not a real lot to say theres a lot to feel about it
2676935 we all played a part in it attitude thats probably a big part of it
2676936 we talked about having a defensive focus at half time
2676937 if we have got 17 men out there that are willing to work hard for each other and theyre focused on what they need to do then you can get a result and certainly things clicked today
2676938 i do not believe this will have an impact on the olympic games i do not think it is related to the olympics
2676939 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2676940 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2676941 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2676942 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2676943 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2676944 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2676945 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2676946 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2676947 their song i want to hold your hand stuck in my mind
2676948 i liked their music harmony instruments accents outfits and their style
2676949 she wanted it to be a tribute to the beatles and to george

2676951 she was there when the beatles were on the ed sullivan shows she took care of george who had 104 degree temperature and had been in a hospital with strep throat but he was able to perform
2676952 im impressed with dans love of music and understanding of radio technology feedback on the program is very positive and people are surprised that it is locally produced
2676953 violent video games have been a problem for a long time
2676954 some parents dont know what their children are playing and are just happy they are not out of their sight but these games can have very damaging psychological effect on children especially games which depict violence so casually
2676955 if the committee decides the games are dangerous we may ask the distributors to halt distribution
2676956 some of the equipment was outdated and greg and james have done a great job of updating everything they have really brought it to its full potential
2676957 the studio is bigger than most studios that i have worked in i cant think of any studios that have a live room like we have here
2676958 you can have great equipment but if you dont have someone who knows how to run it then its useless greg knows all genres of music you name it and he can do it
2676959 i think we have the best kept secret in central arkansas we are going to be able to offer things thata lot of other studios cant offer at their rates
2676960 we are going to give you a whole lot of things you cant get unless someone wants to go out and spend 300 000 400 000
2676961 when an artist comes in here we are going to make sure they are taken care of and are given hospitality we are not just here to put you on the time clock and twist knobs
2676962 its important to us how the project sounds when it goes out we are taking a whole different approach to the market and at the same time we are going after the national acts too
2676963 greg is working on a sample disc of music he has produced that includes classical rock hip hop country and blues im putting together a presentation package that has info on the studio and pictures that we will send to record labels and advertising agencies we also have a new web site we are working on that will include a virtual tour
2676964 we feel if we can get you to come out and if youre interested in doing a project we will be able to capture you greg and i have made a commitment that the project will not leave here until its good enough to be on the radio even if its on our own time
2676965 part of the experience is who you are working with and they are both very knowledgeable about the industry the studio is great and it has a great atmosphere
2676966 if they have their name on it then its going to be the best it can be
2676967 at this day the citizens under your special care are satisfied that their lives are jeopardized by the near approach of yellow fever that brings in its wake death and so much distress as a committee of your citizens we now come to you and appeal for assistance from you

2676969 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2676970 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2676971 he was just so alive i cant believe hes gone
2676972 it was such a popular show because of his bigger than life persona
2676973 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2676974 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you

2676977 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2676978 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2676979 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2676980 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about

2676990 rennes 4 4 marseille la vid o des huit buts
2676991 underscore this 11th hour bid to save the nations greatest river
2676992 it sent a very clear message by saying weve had a lot of talk about the river system a lot of science we all know what the problem is we just want politicians to have the will to fix it up he said after the rally
2676993 they need to secure water upstream and send it down
2676994 we need to give these lakes another chance mr mchugh said
2676995 there was a real sense that enough is enough now theres no more excuses now its got to happen she said
2676996 the problem is there isnt the political will currently in the labor party senator hanson young said
2676997 they have the power to do it its about having the guts to do it

2677002 these lights are too bright i dont see how you expect anyone to sleep in here
2677003 the emergency room was too much stimulation for them with emergencies coming in their stress level goes out the roof
2677004 were taking patients into an environment more therapeutic to meet their needs its calm quiet and structured
2677005 they start to know that they can get the help that they need here
2677006 for two years maybe 2 1 2 years after the storms the only cry that we heard at this office was we need more beds
2677007 having this front end has helped sort out who needs an acute bed versus who can be served in some other method that is less restrictive and less costly we dont have to have as many people looking for beds as before
2677008 their symptoms appear to be less aggravated and less acute in the unit
2677009 still in all because we have an environment conducive to calmness and structure that has the staff to accomodate their needs even if they end up going to an inpatient psych facility theyre a lot calmer before they get there their therapy has actually started here instead of waiting 12 hours
2677010 we expected people in mental crisis because of what happened to them but for a long time our state had a problem with people presenting to emergency rooms with behavioral health issues
2677011 we didnt have a strong continuum of care for patients with this type of need the emergency room was the place they ended up when they were in crisis
2677012 in addition to compromising our ability to deliver emergency care to the traditional patient presenting to the ed for a medical surgical emergency the addition of psychiatric patients to the acute ed environment limited our ability to effectively care for either group in the safest most therapeutic environment
2677013 as an extension area of the acute ed mhere staff are dedicated to working with public and private psychiatric agencies around the state to refer and place these patients in the best care setting as expeditiously as possible the time to appropriate setting has been improved with better patient outcomes the ultimate goal
2677014 it has definitely decreased the amount of bottlenecking that has occurred in the emergency room
2677015 when i got back to the emergency room with one intern and started seeing emergency psych patients of the 23 beds in the emergency room one particular day 18 of those were filled with behavioral health emergency patients
2677016 this has markedly improved that we dont have an overflow in the emergency room therefore the emergency room can do their job too
2677017 the bravery of young sophie and the delezio family is an inspiration mr iemma said
2677018 the work of the foundation has made possible an avenue of hope and support for many other families facing difficult circumstances of this kind
2677019 through the tragic experience of the delezio family we have been reminded of the vulnerability of our young and our obligation to protect and care for them mr iemma also said
2677020 the money will be put to good use because it provides funding for specialised medical treatment ongoing research outpatient rehabilitation and community education
2677021 its the guys who own the oil being pumped out of the ground and overwhelmingly its people in the middle east
2677022 theres nothing we can really do to put down the price of oil thats going to be meaningful
2677023 i was running a little late and every garage was full
2677024 the valet service was 20 or 30 a little expensive but it was a hot hot day so i pulled in there when i left the luncheon i was pulled aside and told that there had been an accident and there was some damage to the car
2677025 i wanted them to call the repair shop and discuss costs but they were adamant about sticking by their estimate
2677026 i dont want to have the body shop open up the car and have them start the work and then get denied by towne park for the entire cost of the work
2677027 if it was just a couple hundred dollars i would have worked with them but its a lot more than that
2677028 i just think this is so unfair im not even in my car i end up doing all the work and now i might end up paying for this i may or may not get my money back and ill probably get a mark against me on my insurance record
2677029 if a vehicle is damaged or a guest reports an item missing or harmed we proceed until the claim is settled
2677030 clients are kept informed but not involved unless they choose to be all claim releases include both towne park and our client towne park endeavors to settle claims promptly saving money and ensuring client and guest satisfaction
2677031 its a service that sheraton contracts out but the guest has a connection with us we have a duty to make sure our guests are happy
2677032 i was not aware that this was not being handled
2677033 there should have been closure with our guest thats a lack of follow up on our part it is towne parks responsibility but we should have stayed on top of this with towne park
2677034 it does not relate to any actual liquidation of a brokerage firm there is no address provided for correspondence there is no reference to a specific brokerage firm failure no one should provide the kind of personal information asked for in this case without first being 100 percent sure that it is coming from a valid entity
2677035 my role is to assist these programs that care for young children the onus is on these centers to train these children and prepare them for school ready to learn
2677036 i cant even put a number on the amount of hours im constantly working you cannot miss a beat when you work for yourself
2677037 i really enjoy what i do when i see good teaching if you can teach those young children thats the foundation
2677038 i think now more and more educators are beginning to realize that those early years are the most important years
2677039 that are less likely to be influenced by shifts in the global economy
2677040 a lot of these mistakes come down to the functioning of payroll
2677041 one person was declared dead on the scene two passengers were treated for minor injuries and another for serious injuries
2677042 the situation is sometimes so overwhelming that we dont know what to do about crime we have not necessarily taken the right decisions over the past 15 years or used resources efficiently we have to brace ourselves now
2677043 this means only 15 of the polices total workforce is focused on solving crime this system suffers of a lack of oxygen and is the result of insufficient policy decisions
2677044 this has a greater significance than anything ive ever been part of
2677045 it will be the highest energy game ive ever been part of
2677046 if they dont understand this they dont know what theyre talking about its simple youre playing for your country
2677047 thats the first time id ever heard those usa chants in person and it was the most amazing thing ever
2677048 nobody in l a wants to win for the lakers more than me everybody knows it but this is something totally different

2677053 el cross country es un tremendo desaf o porque es una exigencia en la que no somos fuertes
2677054 s que por mi juego me parezco m s a ronaldinho pero a m siempre me gust rivaldo
2677055 llevar el n mero 10 a la espalda de la verdeamarelha es una responsabilidad especial porque lo utilizaron gente como zico y pel pero la asumo lo llevo bien
2677056 todav a no quedamos fuera hay que seguir luchando y nuestra meta principal es avanzar a la siguiente ronda
2677057 dejamos de sacar fuerte y ellas las brasile as nos sacaron fuerte y tuvimos problemas con la recepci n que fueron los puntos que nos costaron
2677058 est bamos con muchas ganas entramos a jugar y eso fue lo m s importante tenemos que intentar mantener esa motivaci n para seguir avanzando
2677059 hicieron un cambio r pido en el segundo set y nosotras no pudimos ajustar brasil es un equipo fuerte dif cil se pudo ganar pero falt un poquito
2677060 son equipos fuertes y tenemos que entrar con muchas ganas y jugar
2677061 meter muchos goles en un partido es muy dif cil china ha jugado muy bien creo que va a estar arriba en el primer tiempo hemos estado plantados y si hubi ramos acertado el primer penalti c rner que se ha ido al poste podr a haber sido distinto en la segunda parte hemos tenido la mala suerte de encajar el tercer gol nada m s empezar
2677062 una situaci n muy complicada durante dos meses entrenando con la inc gnita de saber si podr an ir a los juegos
2677063 ha sido una situaci n dif cil que puede influir en el estado de nimo del equipo pero los juegos ya han empezado y eso es pasado ahora hay que pensar en australia que puede estar un pel n m s baja de lo que est habitualmente
2677064 es un poco decepci n y un poco palo empezar as
2677065 est por encima de nosotras en el r nking y es el pa s anfitri n ha sido un partido muy dif cil si nos hubi ramos puesto por delante cuando hemos mandado una bola al palo podr a haber sido diferente
2677066 en unos juegos el que se pone por delante tiene mucho ganado y m s en el primer partido
2677067 ellas se han puesto por delante se han relajado y nosotras nos hemos acelerado
2677068 es el primer partido pero se ha luchado y se ha intentado el campeonato es largo y hay que levantar cabeza y pensar en australia
2677069 est bamos un poco ansiosas para acertar pero lo importante es que conseguimos cambiar y entonces nos fue muy bien
2677070 i knew he was a little bit slow and i could see us catching him and to get him on the last corner was pretty fantastic
2677071 i think this is the view dario had on the last lap in chicago last year
2677072 i tried everything second seems to be my place what can i say
2677073 ive been tempted for a while especially with this horse to try american racing
2677074 its like boating some people have a canoe some people have a chris craft
2677075 i think theyll realize its a whole lot more than high society sitting around drinking tea or champagne
2677076 i would say it was a lot of fun also a lot of work
2677077 to be standing on the podium with sada and becca makes it even more special
2677078 we are training partners and teammates all season and i couldnt ask for a better result than seeing three american flags being raised im really really happy
2677079 i kind of got my head back into that bout where i think i was a little hung up on my last bout
2677080 i teared up and president bush handed me his handkerchief i didnt know what to think but that was pretty cool
2677081 chinas always had a strong record in gymnastics so we have a special affinity for it its a part of our history like li ning
2677082 to have the whole crowd behind you and cheering like that id never experienced that before everyone who came was great
2677083 if they fall or touch the ground or have any errors we can see it
2677084 if they do well we know it we dont know how to score but good or bad we know
2677085 he looks like hes 25 hes got a huge game
2677086 i was empty at the end just in terms of fuel i just havent had seven hour rides
2677087 we all took the bus over the four of us and it was a really special moment just to be a part of this is amazing
2677088 even if you were the worst carbon emitter in the world if you wrote a huge check you could claim to be carbon neutral
2677089 this is not a get out of jail free card
2677090 i think anyone who comes into the games wants to win a gold medal
2677091 we knew they were the world record holder to get a silver medal here against these athletes is a tremendous feat
2677092 its a great feeling i was looking at the medal and how beautiful it was i do have 10 i think michael phelps is going to surpass that
2677093 we knew america and australia were very fast and strong
2677094 i thought no one would go under 4 30 it hurt so much more than the swim i did at the trials its awesome im still in shock
2677095 i am a little tired but i am happy to get my first ever olympic medal
2677096 everyone in that race was i gave it everything i had you cant complain when you get a best time
2677097 its an honor and a privilege to be here especially to swim in front of the president
2677098 out back in the dressing rooms i saw the tv and i saw the president and i said the president is watching its time to step it up
2677099 even if you were the worst carbon emitter in the world if you wrote a huge check you could claim to be carbon neutral
2677100 this is not a get out of jail free card
2677101 osama would like this on the 11 oclock broadcast thanks gotta run
2677102 we bring together the worlds leading authorities and industry participants through informative two hour live webinar to study the impact of changing regulations

2677104 this is really the first time we saw kyle playing healthy and i think he did well
2677105 by far the most powerful and complete broadband television publishing system you can get today
2677106 by far the most powerful and complete broadband television publishing system you can get today
2677107 i watch him a lot not so much how he goes about throwing to hitters but about how he approaches the game
2677108 the way he fields his position manages the game who he throws to who he doesnt the inner workings
2677109 i need every advantage i can get and hes been one of the best pitchers in this game for a long time so he knows what hes doing
2677110 when hes pitching im watching him any time hes throwing ill be in the front row
2677111 hes earned at least a months worth of triple a at bats
2677112 he hit in the middle of the order in midland he played all three outfield positions he really had quality at bats
2677113 that makes it clear that the targets of the russian military were not only georgian economic objects but international objects on georgian territory
2677114 its going to be like college again playing 36 in one day
2677115 i was hitting it around 300 yards when i was 13 or 14
2677116 thats when i knew i was pretty long my senior year of high school i watched the pros and i realized they didnt hit it any farther than i did
2677117 that was my goal at the beginning of the year to make the ryder cup team
2677118 ive put myself in a situation where i have a chance it would be a dream come true to play in my home state
2677119 i thought matt passed the test in terms of poise and execution
2677120 i thought for the first time in an nfl game he was very impressive

2677124 if he has the surgery hes out the rest of the year
2677125 if he doesnt theres still a chance he could be out the rest of the year its a blow
2677126 hes a guy who goes out there every day gives you 100 percent every day and is one of the leaders of this team emotionally and on the field its very disappointing for him and us
2677127 he went for the ball and didnt see me and his hand went into my stomach
2677128 i think its kind of sad that theyre thinking about that instead of their country
2677129 we have no control over how they pick the team and who the manager is our job is to play baseball not worry about whos managing
2677130 its a pity that people think about that instead of what they should do on the field
2677131 both are the same age i think what billingsley is doing this year is a lot of what matts been doing the last few starts
2677132 forced to listen to each other see the world differently and see the impact on the community
2677133 one million people within 1 000 steps of a great transportation system
2677134 its a reflection of peoples desperation more than it is a reflection of just positive things about people working longer and being happy to work longer
2677135 thats just going to be exacerbated by the current economy
2677136 im getting a lot of phone calls by people who are trying to come up with alternatives theyre really starting to worry
2677137 the rough part in what were seeing with a couple of these folks is that they had planned on doing some consulting if they needed the extra income
2677138 now theyre panicked and wanting the extra income and they cant get the consulting because everybodys cutting back and the consulting jobs are drying up
2677139 certainly episodic changes in the economy change short term behaviors
2677140 the good news bad news story is that we are living longer so you actually need to have more money
2677141 certainly there are pension reasons for people wanting to stay in
2677142 defined benefits and social security tend to let people retire when the economy is worse 401 k s and housing to the extent that those values shrink when the economy is doing badly have the opposite effect
2677143 its a negative macro economic trend and it definitely has been worrisome
2677144 before there was social security people worked until they died or they lived with their kids
2677145 there really has never been a generation where people have been expected to fund years of retirement out of savings its kind of heroic what were asking people to do now
2677146 overall there may be a silver lining in all of this
2677147 that information transfer and big shock of losing so many workers in such a short amount of time may be lessened if these 65 to 70 year olds stay in the labor force a little bit longer
2677148 they want to continue to contribute and they want to be doing something worthwhile
2677149 they are afraid to start doing nothing for fear that theyll fall apart and the more they stay physically and mentally active the longer theyre going to have a fulfilling life
2677150 for many people it just makes sense to keep on working
2677151 i would not be surprised at all if we see that average age of retirement creeping up and not necessarily because of any financial pressure although that may be part of it but i dont see that as the main motivating thing
2677152 i dont know what i would do if i retired
2677153 basically i want to work i want to do something
2677154 it got harder to leave when you got to be here awhile it was just easier to stay

2677164 its a pretty difficult offense to learn and im sure the one ive been in the last 16 years has been difficult too itll take some time but i think well be fine
2677165 that seems like so long ago it seems like a dream
2677166 im not going to sit here and tell you that ive got this offense down that i know every guy in the locker room or they know me
2677167 its a routine and im just kind of following them thats different for me
2677168 i was really surprised that today i was as effective as i was and im not saying that that was good
2677169 im just saying i was able to take a snap call a play we were able to break a huddle and i was able to complete passes in some sort of rhythm
2677170 all the rumors about him throwing hard yeah theyre true
2677171 as soon as we stepped out here the stands are filled and it creates a new energy for the team
2677172 i came here as a kid and there were always a few people here and there but nothing like this
2677173 anytime you have a chance to get a guy like brett favre youve got to go get him
2677174 now with him theyre going to go at least 10 6
2677175 were on track looking around at everyone we all said we could have done things better we didnt peak out today we are where we want to be
2677176 we proved to the naysayers that were still medal contenders
2677177 its probably not good that we read this stuff on the net because we know people doubt us but we have something to prove
2677178 i got angry and thought about those moments when i let the horse go and i decided that im not falling off no matter what
2677179 it was a reaction that i dont even have to describe you have to understand what liz bachman is to usa volleyball shes probably the nicest person in the entire world her and her family
2677180 her family is like our family because they traveled with us she fought in the 2004 olympics with us she was my roommate in 2004
2677181 you know there are a lot of things we cannot control the thing we can control is ourselves try to deal with it try to be strong
2677182 of course its a very very difficult time and its the first time in my life to deal with that situation before a game i have to be patient and let players get over it and cheer for them and help them
2677183 no one cares about us at all lets call it what it is its good all the attention has went the other way cause we really dont like it so you know brett favre going to the jets it can be pretty positive for us all you guys are going to pay attention to them now
2677184 he got a broadway sign and hes on the paper every day so now they have to deal with it i think he is going to realize the media is a little different than in green bay he cant control it
2677185 remember its a long time until we play a game that counts
2677186 it wasnt by design for him to have so few attempts but we knew he was not going to play very much hell play more next week so hell throw more in general
2677187 the situation of the game coach felt like that was enough for me
2677188 i dont know yet that we can all of a sudden be a pass heavy team and throw the ball all over the place
2677189 theres no part of me right now that could tell you we would be able to change right now from where we were last year
2677190 anytime someone plays that well especially at that position it builds your confidence in him
2677191 andrew has gone through a lot and i think it made him stronger
2677192 i wouldnt say we were nervous we just werent getting the shots to fall early
2677193 we just stuck to our game plan and we figured out a few things
2677194 if you let teams get into their comfort zones its going to be tough
2677195 every game is going to be physical and every game is going to be tough when we play them
2677196 they came out and battled but were so deep its tough five go off and five more come in for us
2677197 doors open and doors shut and this was the door that was opened to me
2677198 just to play basketball and be in this venue is amazing
2677199 could i have had it if i wanted yes but im part of something bigger than just football im part of rutgers university
2677200 mike was probably thinking of giving the line some confidence to slow down the pass rush
2677201 youre not keeping him throwing the ball youre doing it so that when he does throw he can have success
2677202 i thought he had great command he was moving the offense alex was moving the ball too although his throws were not as efficient he didnt have the turnovers but he made throwing errors that j t did not shaun was more difficult to evaluate playing with the backups
2677203 it happened so quickly it kind of came off a cross amy rodriguez tried to go for it and it came over her head and my eyes lit up i was at the top of the box and just made sure i hit a nice smooth stroke
2677204 i am very happy about our performance today against a very technical talented japan team
2677205 besides a great goal by carli lloyd i am very happy about our tactics
2677206 i think the more minutes we get together in the olympics the better it is we have 180 minutes now and get 90 more against new zealand so we will improve our game from one game to another

2677217 the market is simple reflecting the fundamentals of supply and demand markets participants are considering the world slowdown the deterioration in expectations for the growth worldwide

2677228 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2677229 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2677230 one unexpected side effect of the competition and certainly something that could only happen in this wonderful modern age and the free access to instant publication that blogging offers is that many of the competitions unsuccessful entrants have been getting in touch chatting admiring each others work and who knows perhaps forging new alliances

2677242 it is the tradition of our country to give shelter to a person seeking it but we also expect our guests not to do anything that will make problems either for the citizens or the countrymen
2677243 i have no knowledge and it is not possible for a foreign minister to keep track of a guest or where she will come
2677244 we knew we would have to bat well in the second innings
2677245 i think its even stevens now theres still a lot of hard work to do
2677246 the guys will be fighting to win because i still think we have the opportunity to win this test
2677247 sampling frequency should be at least five to ten times as high as the highest frequency component of the signal
2677248 i like competing and i wanted to stay in and finish the game but sometimes your emotions get the best of you and you might do something irrational out there he thought i did thats part of the game its all patched up now though were buddies
2677249 i missed a month without being here with the team
2677250 and i wanted to try to prove myself again that i can pitch in the big leagues and i wanted to stay out there as long as i could he made the decision and thats his decision
2677251 he just wanted to stay in the game and i like that theres nothing wrong with that in fact if he didnt want to stay in the game id probably be mad
2677252 ill tell you something his confidence got back thats why i took him out of the game i wasnt going to let him lose the game he was leaving on a high note and theres four left handed hitters standing there i wasnt going to give him a chance to get hit he already pitched a good game and did a good job
2677253 when the ball is in my hands im capable of doing some great things
2677254 im willing to do anything to help this football team its a great team here a lot of great players im just the exception and trying to fit in
2677255 when he gets the ball in his hands he looks like he can do a lot of things he caught one pass did a spin move and spun away from some people it was electrifying for me because i know i cant do it so it was pretty cool to watch it
2677256 a great opportunity for me to get out there and get some balls from donovan and go with the rest of the guys and have some fun it was awesome just the environment it was great its a big opportunity for me to come into the nfl and play with a great team like this
2677257 just a fake reverse to catch the defense off guard a little bit
2677258 one of those kind of trick plays whatever i have to do to help this team out and be successful ill do
2677259 he did some nice things and hes got a couple of things he has to correct
2677260 he made some plays but he has to be a little sharper and crisper on a couple of things we did out there that goes for everybody you saw his hands and the way he can run routes he is very good at making moves
2677261 the biggest thing for me right now is experience the more experience i get the more comfortable ill be and the better i will do it i just keep working hard
2677262 in college the return is there you get a little more time to get off its there i can adjust to it its no big thing
2677263 i really think people got to see how much of an addition desean can be this year
2677264 desean played better than a lot of people expected he had that little hamstring issue in camp and you never got to see that go route where he exploded on people but the catches he made over the middle and the patience he showed for his first nfl game you got to be excited that guy is going to be used in a lot of different ways

2677271 i told him if the czechs came back and the u s lost this game id come and find him
2677272 it was awesome i know he had to leave early
2677273 its an honor that he came out and watched us perform and that he is a fan of the womens basketball
2677274 just to come out here tonight and see how many fans were supporting us and that our president was out here was good
2677275 we knew the mens team was going to come today
2677276 they were saying all day were going to come were going to come
2677277 we gained some confidence but know that the americans were at half strength
2677278 we have nothing to lose in this game all the pressure is on them
2677279 he asked how short i said id get back to him
2677280 it happened so quickly it kind of came off a cross amy rodriguez tried to go for it and it came over her head and my eyes lit up i was at the top of the box and just made sure i hit a nice smooth stroke
2677281 i am very happy about our performance today against a very technical talented japan team

2677341 im a mural artist who has discovered the challenge of painting on canvas rather than walls its limited space but i love it what better place to crawl into your thoughts when you can create them in front of your own eyes
2677342 i am a stay at home mom who needs a break from the 17 month old that i call my son he is very active and keeps me very busy my husband and i recently relocated with his job
2677343 i am single and looking and am told by pogo chatters that i am funny i have a serious side and am very opinionated about things in our world and life in general i dont smoke and drink socially and i am a great cook
2677344 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but
2677345 i was born and raised a redneck from the south in my home town of wichita kansas but i now live in michigan i enjoy football camping occasionally visiting the casino and playing pogo games
2677346 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
2677347 and when he gets in the huddle and commands you cant measure that he becomes a different kid its not that he motivates by yelling he motivates by setting an example
2677348 i come to practice work out go to my bedroom do my homework and then go to bed
2677349 if thats what the media is looking for youre not going to get it
2677350 hell be very honest hell be very forthcoming and hell always talk about his teammates and not himself and thats not the way its been up at penn state the past couple of years which has been kind of concerning to me
2677351 he has enormous pride he has enormous pride for the program he told me last year when the off the field incidents were happening that he felt like he could do something to get to the guys and help them
2677352 its always been a thing for me ever since pee wee football
2677353 that once you get on the field something happens that totally changes the person
2677354 he needs to do the little things and work harder than everybody
2677355 i went to penn state and coach joe paterno has been there for a long time i dont have to say a whole lot more
2677356 he sits back there in the pocket and makes quick reads he throws on time hes niftier than a lot of people think he can get out of the pocket and move he just has that it that you cant coach
2677357 is clark going to transfer if he doesnt get the job no
2677358 theres a battle hopefully its going to be a fair competition with the winner winning and the backup being there when needed
2677359 i looked up like holy smokes shes talking to me
2677360 i just wanted to tell you how sorry i am for the crossfire
2677361 my dad and i feel that you are the real winner
2677362 some people say the spirit of the games is just to participate
2677363 most of the men in my family were hunters i started hunting when i was 10 years old
2677364 our first goal was to get top three and advance and then it was to put as much heat on the other top crews as we could
2677365 it was a good start we have a lot to improve on and im looking forward to the semifinal
2677366 i feel like weve been sitting around the hotel it feels good to get going it was really good to get out there with karsten you know that her speed is on you can see what the speeds are on this course whats possible in this headwind it was good to get the experience on the course
2677367 our work ethic is definitely good we come to the ballpark with the idea that our guys like to play
2677368 when we dont score runs it means were not hitting with guys in scoring position
2677369 every day is a wanting to win deal putting 100 percent in everything about it theres no slack period or things like that but if you put forth the effort and you dont score runs i dont know i dont have the answer for that
2677370 we get to 3 2 and we chase a ball instead of taking ball four we dont execute or we have trouble executing i dont know what to do about it you can say well youve got to do something about it well what everything about it is attitude baseball is an attitude thing youve got to bring it every day
2677371 the reason is because i think ruiz throws better and he blocks balls better coste is very good defensively hes not a bad defensive catcher but i like ruiz on lidge better
2677372 i got a strikeout on it a number of outs on it its probably not in the scouting report for them over there
2677373 so maybe what we see and what comes out is sometimes two different stories
2677374 im just going to move on ive already done that
2677375 of course i wanted to stay longer and help those guys more but 30 guys got away and we didnt have anybody there and i tried to react as quick as possible we were going fairly quick its better to shut a group out like that fairly quick
2677376 i kind of already knew what he had what he was going to bring
2677377 but i kept my composure and finished the rounds ahead on points and i did what i had to do
2677378 i was empty at the end just in terms of fuel i just havent had seven hour rides
2677379 the guy that i raced today wasnt the guy who won the tours so i dont put myself in that category
2677380 but it was great of him to come out and do this race and to race with all the people hes a class act out there it was fun we didnt talk a whole lot because it seemed like it was pretty much business
2677381 i will hug him and squeeze him and call him george
2677382 n source i will hug him and squeeze him and call him george who would be a worse mom paris or lindsey vote now and get a free iphone chris rock used
2677383 i knew he was a little bit slow and i could see us catching him and to get him on the last corner was pretty fantastic
2677384 i think this is the view dario had on the last lap in chicago last year
2677385 i tried everything second seems to be my place what can i say
2677386 theres no better way to return than for the olympics
2677387 it was important to us that shawn had a normal life
2677388 she wanted to go to public school chow was all for that
2677389 he makes a game of teaching a new skill and shawn likes the challenge
2677390 its a pretty difficult offense to learn and im sure the one ive been in the last 16 years has been difficult too itll take some time but i think well be fine
2677391 im not going to sit here and tell you that ive got this offense down
2677392 its a routine and im just kind of following them thats different for me
2677393 when you have a program you have young players that maybe are known about during recruiting but then you dont hear from them for a year or two
2677394 just because you dont hear from them doesnt mean theyre not getting better and better all those people are in place and now theyre just waiting their turn
2677395 were getting there are we there at every position not quite yet but i look at some of the competitions on the practice field and were getting closer
2677396 we cant live up to what ray rice did we just want to make names for ourselves
2677397 were having our running backs be a part of this offense weve got four guys that can play football
2677398 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2677399 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2677400 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2677401 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i will have a chance for tomorrow i have to wait but its great to be here
2677402 to make a major team personnel change compete in the first subdivision and qualify for the team finals is a huge accomplishment and we are looking forward to competing on tuesday
2677403 we had a mantra today and it lit us on fire
2677404 we didnt hold back for one moment we competed like it was our last day
2677405 we are just praying he is ok because we really need him for the final
2677406 i havent seen him but others say he seems ok
2677407 getting them back was like making a big deal without losing anybody
2677408 in the past id have said a lot of guys would be gone but with them signing hanley to a long term deal it shows theyre willing to make an effort but i dont know who else theyd do that with nothing is for certain nobody knows who if anybody will be gone
2677409 right now weve put ourselves in a position to win the division and we cant worry about anything else

2677419 lebih tertarik sama yang beda sama aku ada sesuatu yang bisa dipelajari
2677420 ada perkembangan baik sekali dibanding minggu lalu sudah bisa mengenali orang
2677421 dia moreno sudah cukup tahu apa yang akan dia lakukan
2677422 im 59 years old and ive never stood on my own two feet without wrestling
2677423 i need to find out if i can vince mcmahon cant prop me up forever
2677424 i want everybody in the world to know that i love and respect the wwe
2677425 they ve helped me through so much of my life and have made me a better person they recognized me and my family at wrestlemania and have propped me up and helped me as long as they can
2677426 but its not really free taxpayers are paying for it
2677427 it is the taxpayer of the united states money but it doesnt cause any difficulty to the community to take the money
2677428 this rumor has been surfacing periodically for a number of years going back to my days with foleys
2677429 as you know we dont comment on rumors and speculation i am not aware of any plans to open a store in lubbock
2677430 last year people were picking us to win the national championship game and we went 6 6
2677431 were playing a team that has garnered an awful lot of momentum the last two years
2677432 on the air in the last year bill oreilly has defended the nazis from world war ii on three separate occasions yes i wish i were making this up
2677433 said day intended to say islamic extremists an important distinction as some muslims feel inappropriately discriminated against since the sept 11 terrorist attacks
2677434 generalissimo oreilly remains upbeat look not on this as a defeat in the war on christmas this was a dramatic victory in billows new war against hanukkah
2677435 its unacceptable to think sounds like something straight out of george orwells 1984 instead it was something straight out of george bushs mouth and not only issuing those chilling words its unacceptable to think but doing so in answer to the call to conscience from his own former secretary of state colin powell
2677436 we are going to strengthen the security at scenic spots to make sure no sharp weapons can be brought into the area
2677437 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2677438 i would like to express my heartfelt sympathy to you and the family of the victims over this unfortunate incident
2677439 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2677440 it is tragic for the family concerned but it wont change our plans this really could happen anywhere
2677441 but i am going to be staying with my tour group though as it is when you go off on your own you could get trouble
2677442 in moscow there is no way i would walk at night as i do here
2677443 i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2677444 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2677445 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2677446 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway and im not sure politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2677447 i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2677448 a person working in the bank reported it we have several teams looking for her we have to be certain
2677449 were facing an economic blockade and this has forced us to take this natural route and march to muzaffarabad
2677450 our produce mainly apples is rotting at least 1 500 truckloads of fresh fruit are waiting to be transported to markets outside kashmir
2677451 theyll remain deadlocked and each side will use it to become more deeply entrenched in their positions
2677452 this resolution expands the range of restrictive measures adopted by the u n security council
2677453 show restraint when granting new public loans for trade with iran and to also be vigilant on activities taken by financial institutions with banks based in iran
2677454 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2677455 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2677456 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2677457 ahhh thats so easy i can do with my eyes closed
2677458 the concept had been on the table for some years now all countries have finally agreed on the formation and implementation of the saarc food bank
2677459 properly realised it would serve as a milestone in strengthening the existing cooperation among the nations of south asia
2677460 this involves the construction of new food warehouses in member countries local procurement and the international purchase of extra food grains and developing an administrative system and a distribution network so it is likely that it will take some time before operationalising the saarc food bank
2677461 all peaceful avenues have been exhausted to resolve the conflict
2677462 we are now compelled to resort to the application of proportionate and justifiable force so that peace and order may be restored in north cotabato
2677463 hamas has agreed to close the file of political detentions and fatah showed its readiness too but there were no measures of datesset for doing so
2677464 weve been around since 1890 and it seemed hardly anybody had heard of us
2677465 we kicked around some ideas and decided the best way to let people know about us was to go out and tell them we dont have resources for a major advertising campaign
2677466 the thing we have done since 1890 is to provide residential care for children who are abused or neglected we call them at risk they have been abused emotionally or physically
2677467 who need a little or an extensive amount of help to live on their own
2677468 we walk in the mornings before it gets too hot
2677469 deafeningly bright safety green shirts the highway department is jealous of us
2677470 began rallying their churches to support the establishment of a baptist orphanage
2677471 their families placed them with the baptist orphanage because of economic hardships
2677472 a new name was needed that would be inclusive of all of our programs open our doors to all denominations and convey our statewide locations beyond our former singular
2677473 i am frequently rude unsympathetic unempathetic and politically incorrect to put it mildly but theres no law against that
2677474 so yeah its to sic bad megan killed herself but its not surprising i mean if she didnt have enough to eat at dinner that could have set her off and made her kill herself
2677475 why dont people fact check who this stuff is coming from why do they assume its true
2677476 you just wonder what other twisted person will twist him up
2677477 maybe there is something that happened to him that he has no feelings
2677478 the drug issue from azerbaijan in the qualifying tournament was quite complicated and as you know for two months our team was quite perturbed by this issue
2677479 there were even discussions in the team whether it was wise for us to come to the beijing olympic games or not
2677480 i personally had a role in calming down the emotions of the team members
2677481 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2677482 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2677483 a language becomes the language of the person who knows how to use it
2677484 more than 7m families who receive child benefit are to be given a one off payment of 150 to help meet soaring fuel bills under plans being drawn up by gordon brown the 1 billion handout is expected to form a key part of the prime ministers autumn fightback after a dismal first 14 months in power
2677485 all the signs are that mr brown intends to spend very large amounts of taxpayers money in an ultimately doomed effort to save his political skin this spending is likely to make almost no difference to the looming tsunami of higher inflation plunging house prices repossessions rocketing fuel bills rising unemployment and bankruptcies that make up the true state of the economy and which will terminate his premiership
2677486 that nicola cooke emma pooley and sharon laws will take 3 and a half hours to complete the 72km route unless all the competitors are stopping for a pleasant sunday afternoon picnic with a glass or two of pimms i suspect that an average speed of 20km per hour wont secure a medal
2677487 since yesterday i thought we would leave the games the russian political leaders our political leaders and other state political leaders should sit and talk about this
2677488 45 channels of shit on the tv to choose from choose from
2677489 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2677490 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2677491 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2677492 all parties to immediately end hostilities and to engage without delay in negotiations to achieve a peaceful settlement
2677493 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication
2677494 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2677495 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2677496 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2677497 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2677498 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2677499 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2677500 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2677501 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2677502 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2677503 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2677504 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2677505 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2677506 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c

2677516 sebenernya nenek sedang menulis tentang kamu tapi ada yang lebih penting dari isi tulisan ini yaitu pensil yang nenek pakai
2677517 nenek harap kamu bakal suka pensil ini ketika kamu besar nanti
2677518 pensil ini mempunyai 5 kualitas yang bisa membuatmu selalu tenang dalam menjalani hidup kalo kamu selalu memegang prinsip prinsip itu dalam hidup ini
2677519 kualitas pertama pensil mengingatkan kamu kalo kamu bisa berbuat hal yang hebat dalam hidup ini layaknya sebuah pensil ketika menulis kamu jangan pernah lupa kalau ada tangan yang selalu membimbing langkah kamu dalam hidup ini kita menyebutnya tangan tuhan tuhan akan selalu membimbing kita menurut kehendaknya
2677520 kualitas kedua dalam proses menulis nenek kadang beberapa kali harus berhenti dan menggunakan rautan untuk menajamkan kembali pensil nenek rautan ini pasti akan membuat si pensil menderita tapi setelah proses meraut selesai si pensil akan mendapatkan ketajamnnya kembali begitu juga dengan kamu dalam hidup ini kamu harus berani menerima penderitaan dan kesusahan karena merekalah yang akan membuatmu menjadi orang yang lebih baik
2677521 kualitas kelima adalah sebuah pensil selalu meninggalkan tanda goresan seperti juga kamu kamu harus sadar kalau apapun yang kamu perbuat dalam hidup ini akan meninggalkan atau kesan oleh karena itu selalulah hati hati dan sadar terhadap semua tindakan

2677550 it sounds like some marylanders are going to get a free ride at the expense of others
2677551 oh come on were going to be putting in more mass transit that doesnt even begin to pay for itself
2677552 i want to make sure we continue to improve the intersections of route 32
2677553 my focus is on treading the appropriate balance between roads and mass transit
2677554 clearly we need to continue to offer roads to get people where theyre going but we also need multimodal transit
2677555 ive always believed mass transit is the way to save traffic congestion on the roads
2677556 some people feel we can build our way out of this by building more roads but thats a shortsighted focus
2677557 the bottom line in all this is the public wants options
2677558 we see it from the petitions we get they want a transit system that works especially in the baltimore region
2677559 we met twice so far and on all two occasions she won but at the same time both the matches went right down to the wire which means she had to break sweat getting past me i cannot predict the outcome but i can assure all that i would put my 100 percent tomorrow
2677560 i had not played her earlier so of course i could not go all out right from the word go she played a tactical game and played more of down shots like smash and half smash and i too made some mistakes so i needed time to pick her
2677561 he told me to keep it straight to negate her tactics of playing it across and it paid off
2677562 maces and swords colorful helmets and shields i see rip and break when the army enters and many vassals i see wound each other where the horses of the dead and the injured look for a shelter in the forest
2677563 good night im looking for mr hirogawa hasnt he arrived yet
2677564 do brag sir oliver says roland the courteous sure says the count as long as charles permits shall the king take her daughter whose hair is so blond and put us in her chamber in a discreet bed and ill have her one hundred times that very night otherwise shall i lose my head that is my pledge

2677571 to be honest personally i never thought of myself as sexy or hot but if thats the call that people have taken then i hope i live up to it i am so excited about this
2677572 deepika was our choice as the winner because apart from her huge fan following with the new generation of indians she also has the potential to be an international face this calls for a huge party

2677574 ive no idea about this and if sections of the media in mumbai are talking about such a collaboration then they know something that i dont
2677575 both the parties respect the space that the other occupies but working together that seems a little far fetched
2677576 such talks are embarrassing to both mr bachchan and aamir first because both think the other is desirous of getting together and is therefore reluctant to refute the rumour big feet easy baby

2677579 it is an entertaining film and i have made it for my grandmother and my grandfather the film is about positive attitude that is the usp of the film i am eager to take them to watch the film
2677580 we all are very happy with the movie i am very excited about the film as it is my first home production
2677581 ive often wondered why i havent directed a film so far and the only answer i can come up with is sheer laziness
2677582 javed has written his first script since farhans lakshya for me thats taken care of now i need to get the cast in place sadly theres no place for shabana or my wife tanvi azmi in my film
2677583 why should i restrain myself ill start whenever everything is in place
2677584 ive been celibate for a year and starting to think i may never have a date again
2677585 men seem to look at me and think she went out with george clooney what chance have i got
2677586 im doing very well i feel real good i thank the staff at elvis presley and many many thanks to my many well wishers its great to know people care about you
2677587 need a little more continuity here and i thought we got it i will have to take a look at the film for sure
2677588 deserts are a larger sink for carbon dioxide than had previously been assumed
2677589 id be hugely surprised if this were the missing sink if deserts are taking up a lot of carbon it ought to be obvious
2677590 you would think that seemingly lifeless places must be carbon neutral or carbon sources
2677591 they may have found a significant effect previously neglected but i would like to see more evidence
2677592 thats more carbon uptake than our fastest growing southern forests its a huge number i find it extremely hard to believe
2677593 i thought why wouldnt this also happen in the soil
2677594 whereas the ocean has a single surface for gas exchange li says soil is a porous medium with a huge reactive surface area
2677595 it takes a long time for carbonate to build up in the soil
2677596 i would expect that over a year there would be no significant increase in soil storage due to this process
2677597 we currently do not have the data to say where exactly the carbon is going
2677598 i hope we can corroborate the chinese findings in the mojave
2677599 people have almost completely neglected whats going on with the crusts
2677600 im mystified by the mojave work there is no way that all the co2 absorption observed in these studies is due to biological crusts as there are not enough of them active long enough to account for such a large sink
2677601 we dont want to say that these ecosystems will continue to gain carbon at this rate forever

2677622 what are you talking about nathan heather would never be so cruel

2677629 if id known it would make you so happy i would have announced it years ago
2677630 the cost of that failure 14 years ago is not just somebodys political fortune or their scars
2677631 its the millions of americans who have now gone for almost 15 years without health care
2677632 we didnt get universal health care but we got the north american free trade agreement

2677640 those who perpetuate terror in the world are in fact darwinists darwinism is the only philosophy that values and incites conflict
2677641 tens of thousands of french schools and universities have received copies of a turkish book refuting darwins theory of evolution and describing it as
2677642 evolution didnt happen armenian genocide we didnt do it the holocaust no sir ee leave it to the turk to deny reality
2677643 we want to protect the ball and we want to create turnovers
2677644 we want to play field position we did those things when we gotten them backed up our guys did a great job of keeping them backed up and forcing them to punt we got great field position and were able to take advantage of it a couple times
2677645 it wasnt exactly the way we wanted to come out
2677646 they drove the ball on us and made some plays but we settled in and got some good things accomplished tonight
2677647 it was an important to get into a rhythm and obviously we created two turnovers defensively and thats become our trademark and thats important
2677648 we didnt turn it over or have any penalties in the first half thats a good sign that youre not making any silly mistakes in the first preseason game
2677649 hes what we expected him to be hes got a knack for running the football hes a good football player and he brings that energy that you want to the football team
2677650 when you step on the field your goal is always to win
2677651 the starters got some good work and once we were done we cheered for the younger guys to finish it out it was nice to see them do that

2677655 and i am certainly not handing out cash in exchange for a lecture
2677656 if you want this arrangement to continue you will find a way to praise me for what i am doing right instead of clucking your tongue at me for what i am neglecting to do
2677657 really are you kidding me right now sell by dates
2677658 you have to think about how you posted it a blank cd case originally hmm a retail box with the price on it
2677659 and now in the case with no price on it
2677660 you are when you are pretty new to the forum with activity and involvement
2677661 many of us will hold our opinion and believe it until proven otherwise i myself se eno proff just more suspicion
2677662 i think publishers have concluded the only games that work are the surefire 500 million box office kind of games like
2677663 the transformers game really surprised people how well it did but the movie was big i dont think they expected the dark knight movie to be this big
2677664 its like a ticket stub its a remnant of something you did that you have proof of
2677665 you can see somebody clearly in a polaroid theres just no hiding who they are
2677666 i see this guy in mount vernon all the time she just had a baby she was visiting from new orleans
2677667 polaroid has always had these amazing customers who enjoy our film which makes us feel good
2677668 my hope is that existing customers and a new generation of customers find new ways to act as creatively
2677669 you kind of wonder if any of this would have made any difference earlier on
2677670 the self described neanderthal of the grand old party emphasis old has been catching flack for admitting he is no techno geek he not only did not invent the internet he can barely use it
2677671 although its superficially attractive thats the kind of statement that glosses over so many different facts that in the end its simply wrong
2677672 lincoln was not an expert in the use of the telegraph he didnt use it to win 1860 or 1864 and with jfk it was basically more of an accident he did the tv debate and everybody saw that he did much better than his opponent richard nixon because it was a razor close election with the wisdom of hindsight everybody said kennedy understood television but kennedy was not an expert on tv any more than obama himself is an expert on the internet
2677673 both asia and the west have elite culture but in china confucian forms dominate
2677674 this panda is a flunky who haggles for his own selfish ends
2677675 given the political overlay it becomes very difficult in china to make movies
2677676 if you start off with a fat lazy panda a national symbol someone is bound to come along and say we cant give an image to the world that china is fat and lazy
2677677 if kung fu panda were produced in china audiences would be sniping at the director for not setting a good example
2677678 in cartoon school we learned to combine instruction and entertainment
2677679 but we had a certain tradition before china opened up and its hard to get away from that overnight
2677680 you couldnt have violence or blood which meant no confrontation or drama it was impossible to create anything in the end i didnt want to waste two years of my life on this propaganda so i quit
2677681 thats a wrong place to be looking for a solution trying to get every last drop of oil

2677686 i can count on one hand the number of races ive started to sweat before the race starts
2677687 it feels like you have hot cream all over your body once you go full gas you cannot breathe
2677688 i know it looks bad but i dont think its as bad as it looks
2677689 maybe ill be coughing a little bit later but i honestly dont feel the pollution it actually felt good once we got in the hills and it was overcast or whatever you call this
2677690 were professional cyclists so we go all over the world endure all kinds of conditions and were all dealing with the same thing
2677691 ive raced in some pretty nasty places ive raced in south america and central america where there are old cars are dripping oil on the road potholes in the pavement and dogs in the road were used to it this course here was on brand new pavement and it was beautiful
2677692 as we raced through the city we looked up at the sky and were like what is that
2677693 in utah they say this is a haze its best to give things a happy name in salt lake city we have inversions in the winter it irritates your throat a little but the usoc put air cleaners in our rooms and that has really helped
2677694 to pass from beijing and tiananmen square and climb along the great wall china is a country full of history dreams and incredible beauty

2677701 once this information is shown to be false it is no longer usefull
2677702 progressively more scientists and common sense tell us we humans cause very little global climate change through our emissions of carbon dioxide though land use change is appearing to be a significant cause yet to this point almost all the money is going into the idea that we can stop it leaving many vulnerable people with little or no support in coping with it a sad situation indeed
2677703 i finally got through on the fdic number explained my situation and the guy said i think those accounts are probably insured

2677717 when was the last time you saw a campaign run on social security and medicare
2677718 i expect youll see mccain do well with older voters not because of his age but because of his politics
2677719 you can ride this over and over and you dont get sick
2677720 there are certain ride pieces that you have to have at a carnival
2677721 theres a merry go round a ferris wheel tilt a whirl flying bob those are traditional rides you have to have them its not a fair without them
2677722 its not so much for the kids but the whole family can deal with it mom and dad and two kids in the bucket go around the wheel and see the sights from the fair
2677723 it gets you up and its always fun to get up to the top of the wheel and wave to people you know below you
2677724 a lot of the thrill rides if youre up high youre upside down
2677725 the doors open and close by themselves theres nothing holding you in
2677726 when george ferris put forth his idea it originally was far from being accepted
2677727 it was his rolling observation deck he liked to call it
2677728 it was to show how steel could be manufactured in a way to be completely stable
2677729 when you figure 1 000 plus people were on this thing at one time just imagine that
2677730 when it comes to steel and civil engineering imagine having that number of people on this rolling wheel off lake michigan the winds had to be anticipated it had to be an incredible stable structure or nobody would have got on it
2677731 the only way in which one may comprehend the vastness the almost weird wonderfulness of this construction is to see it overshadowing everything else in that part of the worlds fair region it grows and grows as one approaches nearer finally it appalls and overwhelms
2677732 it is not as tall as the eiffel tower was
2677733 but it has life and motion which the tower had not from the engineering standpoint the wheel is a greater marvel than the tower it is the engineering wonder of this fair and in a month it will be the talk of the country
2677734 the truth is the thing probably would have closed up a lot earlier than it did
2677735 the ferris wheel is just a nice casual ride where you can sit back and still get a great view of the top
2677736 if a child is sensitive to heights the ferris wheel is a controlled environment where youll feel a little bit of an acceleration and the sensation of going up
2677737 these things you cant experience on the internet youve got to come out and ride it and feel it
2677738 when the lights are glowing on the carnival thats kind of the thrilling time couples get up in the wheel you might ask her to marry you you might sneak a kiss thats all part of that too
2677739 you can kind of see it before you get to the park
2677740 we try to set it up so when you make that corner on prospect street you look down the street and you see it
2677741 if you drive on the county side of ballston you can see it through the trees

2677746 there are a lot of middle aged women and men i know that contacted me emailed or stopped me in the street to tell me that i am an inspiration to them and are now doing things that they thought they couldnt do
2677747 age is really just a number and im hoping that my age paves the way for other athletes who maybe think they are too old to do something to get back in or continue in the sport
2677748 its just bizarre i think i might be older than her parents im not sure
2677749 i met her for the first time in coming to the ready room i introduced myself to the australians because ive never even met libby trickett before

2677754 nothing fed ilonas spirits more than the company of men she loved the sound of their hoarse voices the amateur authority with which they spoke about world affairs and other matters they had absolutely no effect on but most of all she loved the flattering light of their attention it lent coherence to her whole character so that she could finally be her most humorous and disarming self

2677756 rumsfeld and the military ignored the issue claiming that it was an unimportant social issue unconnected to fighting terrorism
2677757 when rumsfeld was pointedly asked in 2003 what the united states was doing about drugs in helmand he put the questioner down saying you ask what were going to do and the answer is i dont really know
2677758 told me how he watched convoys of opium traveling past his camp every morning but did not have orders to stop them
2677759 many of the facts dates and names he mentioned were incorrect but he was never contradicted by the two generals sitting in the room with us
2677760 after his lecture i bluntly told him that nobody believed pakistans denials about supporting the taliban the discussion went in circles but i had to be grateful that instead of arresting me musharraf had tried to engage me and change my mind however the encounter convinced me that he considered himself a master of spin and tragically believed that his spin was the absolute truth

2677783 the second year after chasing furies ended i went on tour with michael w smith singing background vocals and playing acoustic guitar with him for his worship again cd that was a lot of fun for me right after that my husband jonathan and i moved to san diego where his family is and where he grew up he is the music director of the church and we lead worship there frequently while also travelling and performing music elsewhere
2677784 its interesting because i had thought that since the christian music industry didnt know what to do with my chasing furies record that id never make a christian record again but after i sat down one day to take a look at the songs that i had been writing i saw that they were even more obviously christian and there was no way a mainstream or non christian market would have that record so here i was again making a record for the church knowing that it was what i was supposed to be doing all along the songs showed that
2677785 my husband jonathan produced it all and played all the guitars on it and actually played a lot of bass on it as well
2677786 it depends on what i am going through at the moment what things do i need to remember about the lord and remind myself about is it to be watchful for his return like i sing in sunshine to remember that he only does wondrous things as my jesus states or do i just need to remember that even though life is crashing down around me and things dont make sense that he does make sense of it and that i know who he is holy worthy abba as i sing in more than hands perhaps thats the one that i need to sing the most right now i know who he is
2677787 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2677788 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2677789 on the right are he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2677790 closing in on 50 and still trying to figure out what i want to be when i grow up
2677791 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2677792 russia is at the moment a party in this conflict
2677793 on a scale of one to 10 we are at about two
2677794 theres a lot of chaos downtown this time of year
2677795 we wont be collecting loose piles of stuff thats out there if you just throw a big pile of food or clothing out there were going to come back and tell you that you have to put that in a bag we wont be picking that up
2677796 if the stuff is in a bag dont open up the bag almost all of the stuff thats in those trash bags is junk
2677797 there is only one way to stop aids that is to screen the entire population regularly and to quarantine all carriers of the disease for life every member of the population should be blood tested every month all those found to be infected with the virus even if only as carriers should be isolated compulsorily immediately and permanently

2677810 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2677811 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

2677818 now we are allowing industry professionals to register and attend any of our 450 regular courses offered every semester
2677819 this is not like a professional development programme but like a regular class that our students go through they can attend classes along with our students and brush up skills in the laboratories
2677820 it is expected that in the years to come iit delhi will be seen as a major catalyst by the industries in their attempt to move up the value chain this is because it requires major upgradation of their manpower skills and iit by reaching out to them can play a vital role
2677821 we have already registered 42 professionals this semester the aim is to fully utilise our resources and help others grow
2677822 but there is no restriction on any industry professional and the course that he or she wants to pursue
2677823 this a pilot project and once it delivers results it will provide a major boost for industry professionals we may also have a full fledged set up for this distant education mode

2677827 difference between those that make it and those that dont is who willing to educate theyself if you dont know how much money you got coming to you aint nobody just gonna tell you what the deal is
2677828 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale lomaia said in these conditions our forces conducted redeployment
2677829 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2677830 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2677831 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2677832 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2677833 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2677834 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2677835 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2677836 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2677837 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2677838 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2677839 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2677840 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2677841 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2677842 paterson has over two decades of experience in human resources with premier manufacturing and service organizations and will be key in the growth and development of the dgna companies
2677843 under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2677844 we saw the impact of the air strikes buildings on fire we could hear the russian jets above us
2677845 in one air strike the pilot missed the intended military base instead hitting two apartment blocks
2677846 when we arrived flames were pouring out of the buildings and people were still trapped inside
2677847 a woman begged the firemen and soldiers to help find her family she said shed gone into the burning apartment block but had not been able to find them
2677848 we saw injured civilians being pulled from the buildings we saw at least one man pulled out dead
2677849 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2677850 ossettia is georgias territory it has been undermined by terrorists funded by moscow
2677851 this is because russia wants to punish georgia for its democratic stance and its western ties at the moment there are between several hundred and two thousand people dead this conflict is not ethnic its not religious its about russia wanting georgia to be subordinate to them
2677852 it is vital for leaders on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2677853 whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2677854 in order to consider withdrawal of our forces we must make sure that there is no chance of genocide there
2677855 there is a straightforward way to stop fighting to stop killing for georgians to withdraw and then to have an agreement on non use of force signed and then we can talk on other verity things including on military and political arrangements
2677856 certain georgian military activity which is supported from outside of south ossetia
2677857 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2677858 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2677859 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2677860 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2677861 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2677862 i will not hurt or kill you if you give me what i want
2677863 call for a cop call for an ambulance and call for a pizza see who shows up first

2677868 no meu ponto de vista era um direito meu estar aqui depois que a rika se machucou
2677869 eu acho que foi muito importante ter vindo participar dos jogos a realiza o de um sonho e uma coisa que vai ficar marcada na minha vida
2677870 a rika estava na porta me esperando ela me deu todas as anota es e os v deos que tinha sobre as advers rias e me desejou boa sorte
2677871 acho que faltou entrar um pouco mais na luta estava um pouco nervosa um pouco travada

2677878 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2677879 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2677880 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2677884 this reminds me of the porch of the grand hotel on mackinac island

2677886 you had to pay just to get on it and you had to be dressed for it
2677887 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
2677888 some of you might have noticed some shuffling on our opinion page michael oneal has moved from his slot every other tuesday into the weekend space he takes the place of ed iverson who needed to step away from column writing after he assumed additional responsibilities at work the tuesday position on the editorial page has been taken over by henry d johnston aka digger a native of northern idaho who moved to moscow about five years ago johnston had applied for a columnist position with the daily news when the editorial board opened up a search earlier this year

2677898 in one quarter or more of patients with influenza a h5n1 virus infection the source of exposure is unclear and environment to human transmission remains possible
2677899 it is unknown whether influenza a h5n1 virus infection can begin in the human gastrointestinal tract
2677900 in several patients diarrheal disease preceded respiratory symptoms and virus has been detected in feces
2677901 drinking potable water and eating properly cooked foods are not considered to be risk factors but ingestion of virus contaminated products or swimming or bathing in virus contaminated water might pose a risk
2677902 maybe it works for them but it certainly wont work for me
2677903 if you think you can do a thing or think you cant do a thing youre right
2677904 reducing cholesterol levels can reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease our research investigated whether ale could be beneficial to otherwise healthy people who had raised levels of cholesterol but were not yet at a stage where they needed standard medical intervention ale may provide another option which people could try over and above a healthy diet in order to help lower plasma cholesterol

2677906 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
2677907 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
2677908 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness
2677909 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
2677910 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
2677911 all of these screaming people want to see the right movie
2677912 we got the right company the right script and the right cast
2677913 i dont know if i was living under a big boulder rock
2677914 but i hadnt heard of the book until catherine came to me
2677915 it hurts me to think about myself i love the fact that edward is the hero of the book but he denies it
2677916 i want to know what its like to portray super hot vampires
2677917 how does it feel to know that the fate of your character has already been decided
2677918 i just needed a reason to come up and talk to you robert
2677919 and we have another great song i bet you know what it is
2677920 the lullaby thing i just made it up on the spot during the scene
2677921 during the scene i drifted into the piano playing i guess it just comes from somewhere
2677922 what it was for me was that heartbreaking misunderstanding seeing something youll never have
2677923 why did you put so many hot guys in the movie
2677924 weve decided to do a five part mini series one big story that will run during one week
2677925 i wanted to make a really big noise about the show
2677926 torchwood really represents the essence of the channel its sexy action packed and a little bit subversive
2677927 so rumor has it that the bbc was unhappy and russell had to rush to write her out of series 3
2677928 personally id be very happy if they didnt add any more principle characters between jack ianto and gwen there are plenty of possible stories to tell for a season thats only having a five episode run
2677929 fans had heard he was going to watch former doctor who star catherine so they turned up in force complete with props
2677930 he was very charming and friendly with them during the interval but he was rightly disgusted when they disrupted her performance by singing the shows music and waving their sonic screwdrivers
2677931 catherine is a pro so she ignored them but david knew the only way to stop them was by getting up and leaving
2677932 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k
2677933 i just learned how to speak like american kids because they made fun of my scottish accent and i didnt want to be bullied when im back in the u k with scottish people i actually go back to my scottish accent
2677934 im of the star wars generation i love science fiction star trek the next generation battlestar galactica love em
2677935 i love every morning getting up to go to work because that little boy inside of me jumps with excitement every time i know im going to fight an alien or shoot a rocket gun or be on a spaceship or be with the doctor or get onto the tardis
2677936 so every time im working on it im really really happy
2677937 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
2677938 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
2677939 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k
2677940 i just learned how to speak like american kids because they made fun of my scottish accent and i didnt want to be bullied when im back in the u k with scottish people i actually go back to my scottish accent

2677943 so every time im working on it im really really happy
2677944 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
2677945 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
2677946 opportunites are just like thieves you dont realize that they are here but when you finally figure out that they are here they go away fast
2677947 were not talking about people who are homeless and on drugs these are hard workers in our community that just cant afford health insurance
2677948 we could be overwhelmed we dont know at this point but if the numbers are correct then i believe we are going to be quite overtaken by people
2677949 its been a neat thing to see people come when theyre young grow up and then their kids come
2677950 i like being able to have that time once a year to renew old friendships and get together and sing together it really is fun to learn a newsong and sing together with old friends
2677951 one of the drawing cards for myself and my family is also to have an opportunity for my child to know her roots and meet and get to know people of her generation who also have that history
2677952 the charisma and the atmosphere has pretty much stayed the same
2677953 its a rustic peaceful setting thats our culture in the ozarks we used shape note singing thats how we all got started its a wonderful experience to still have that today the older gentlemen and ladies they just marvel about how wonderful it is they dont understand how more people arent involved its a great thing for the people who grew up in this area where whether you are actually related or not you feel like it so its a great thing to reconnect
2677954 i know there are a lot of people who make sacrifices to keep the buildings in good shape
2677955 mom keeps it cleaned up my cousin mows the yard other people on the board they make sure the building isnt leaking or in need of repair churches in the area have made donations to help pay the light bill or do little repairs the people that come and teach they dont make a lot of money the way you would ata regular summer job i think they come for the historical part because we were there as young people and on top of that its wholesome entertainment for the kids and the ones who participate can take what they learn back to their home communities
2677956 theyre encouraged to come anyway because many people donate money for that purpose and we dont want to exclude anyone
2677957 its our heritage and i dont want it to die and nobody know what went on
2677958 i have been working tirelessly to write it all down so that other people can know about it and enjoy it
2677959 and for the young ones especially the young ones if they want to do music or if they want to be in any way involved with music they really need to start there that right there will kick you off from the start in the right direction better than public school programsor anything like that thats where it all is right there
2677960 drill here drill now drill here drill now four legs good two legs bad
2677961 suskies 1 year as jag in iraq cut by 6 months
2677962 a privilege not afforded other soldiers and which directly conflicts with u s army policy
2677963 i think well need to get a lot i really do
2677964 we hope the scholarship will provide an opportunity for young people to be able to continue their education and to encourage them because they will know who and why they are getting this particular one and maybe theyll keep that in mind
2677965 we want to help people learn to readand enjoy life as the rest of us know it
2677966 so when the tornado took the office on feb 5 we decided maybe it was best to dissolve the council
2677967 it was a hard thing to do but maybe it was realistic
2677968 its really interesting to think that we have come full circle
2677969 the original ozarka votech supported us in the beginning and now weve come full circle and are giving a scholarship to ozarka students
2677970 for an institution of our size each endowment is significant for us
2677971 what do you want to be when you grow up
2677972 it was inspiring just seeing that my dad got satisfac tion out of helping people
2677973 whether it was catching a murderer or someone who maybe stole somebody elses last dime he found it very gratifying and you didnt make much money as a police officer now or then but in the 60s the pay was just horrible so it wasnt the money that kept him going
2677974 i really feel like now after all these years in law en forcement im really serving my community
2677975 i had never really had the experience of living and working in the same place we now feel like we are part of the community that we want to be a part of itslike it was meant to be
2677976 i want to build on our relationship with the public
2677977 i want to be a more accessible more receptive department i want us to be a professional department that the citizens will respect and be proud of
2677978 we want to go out and meet the folks and let them know who we are
2677979 were serving the community and theyre our eyes and ears if the citizens get to know the officers theyll be more likely to get them information
2677980 when this whole idea of community oriented policing first came about the saying was that traditional policing is not working anymore so lets try something different
2677981 i was able to be there for the swearing in ceremonies

2677986 the only way we can stop sea level rise is if people believe we can
2677987 when i first met carl i thought he was a philosopher
2677988 we must not continue to abuse and destroy our environment
2677989 recovery and rehabilitation of natural resources where it is even possible is incredibly costly by permitting the deterioration of vermonts natural beauty and resources we are committing an inexcusable offense against our children and their children
2677990 report of the governors commission on vermonts future guidelines for growth
2677991 better management of our resources through the establishment of a planning process and a method of protecting open land agriculture and housing will be a significant step toward securing the future we want
2677992 is useful in trying to understand and anticipate the forces that will shape the states future
2677993 gone are kerosene lamps and outhouses one room schools and one horse shays crank telephones and poor farms consumption of sulphur and molasses circus posters and minstrel shows
2677994 vermont has entered the world of jets computers ulcers tranquilizers nuclear power four lane highways shopping center complexes color television and mobile homes
2677995 an environment of natural and creative inspiration an environment which contributes positively to healthful individual and family living
2677996 nature and past generations of vermonters have bestowed a unique environmental legacy that must be wisely used for the benefit of society
2677997 although difficult to document the social cost of disruption of traditional patterns of living must be recognized as considerable
2677998 the sense of community is lost antagonisms are created between the invaders and invaded in new areas of concentrated settlement
2677999 the uses and abuses of the land have an impact on the state as a whole
2678000 absolute local autonomy in environmental matters is proving obsolete and unworkable broader jurisdiction over land use decisions is essential standards should be established and maintained on a statewide basis
2678001 long range coordinated comprehensive planning on the local regional state and inter state levels
2678002 a statewide plan for development based on a concept of concentrated residential settlement and open space preservation
2678003 policies must be adopted to encourage concentrations of settlement commercial residential industrial encompassed by open areas to which residents have access
2678004 what is required for the realization and integrated development by design is a decision and statement by vermonters that they want progress but on their own terms
2678005 adoption of such a development policy will be costly it will take time and sustained effort it will meet vigorous opposition from selfish interests it will mean acceptance of controls and sacrifice of absolute property rights and it will require enormous citizen initiative
2678006 vermonts characteristic values can perhaps be best understood in terms of four basic components community life agricultural heritage environmental quality and the search for opportunity
2678007 heard much about the inability of the existing regulatory process both at the state and local level to effectively manage development
2678008 this feeling has led to calls for stronger statewide planning as well as for more local control
2678009 the commission believes that comprehensive plans must be developed at the local regional and state levels and that the plans should be integrated with each other the process should be guided by statewide policies but controlled from the bottom up
2678010 we are hearing that we still need to find the juncture where we can bring in good people and jobs and not ruin the land air and water that brings them here
2678011 we in vermont have framed our future in terms of this dichotomy for a long time the conversation is still there but its important to ask if it is useful perhaps its time to ask ourselves whats beyond the either or situation
2678012 vermont has an opportunity and obligation to the nation to pioneer in the search for new ways to achieve a harmonious and creative society
2678013 the possibilities of the future for vermont are tremendous and exciting the dangers are equally apparent

2678114 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2678115 i know our program manager is ranking captains on landing with less fuel i dont care to be ranked i think this is a safety problem and i believe fuel is your friend
2678116 looking back i would have liked more gas yesterday and i was already carrying tanker fuel if i wouldnt have had this extra there would have been real problems
2678117 far below my comfort zone and probably less than the minimum fuel required by the fars federal aviation regulations
2678118 our fuel situation had not become critical yet but had we had any delay i would have had to declare a fuel emergency
2678119 i am not sure if the flight plan as given to me by my company was a real flight plan or if they were just telling me it was so that i would continue to jfk thus saving them time and expense in the future if such a situation presents itself again i will divert to my initial destination regardless of what my company says i can do the safety of my crew far outweighs any financial burden to the company
2678120 this was probably the new fuel saving initiative by the company management to save money

2678160 my take is kind of an extrapolation it actually deals with a nephew of the first character its got some of the characters from the h g wells book but its kind of a continuation
2678161 to be honest personally i never thought of myself as sexy or hot but if thats the call that people have taken then i hope i live up to it i am so excited about this
2678162 deepika was our choice as the winner because apart from her huge fan following with the new generation of indians she also has the potential to be an international face this calls for a huge party
2678163 ive often wondered why i havent directed a film so far and the only answer i can come up with is sheer laziness
2678164 javed has written his first script since farhans lakshya for me thats taken care of now i need to get the cast in place sadly theres no place for shabana or my wife tanvi azmi in my film
2678165 why should i restrain myself ill start whenever everything is in place
2678166 im doing very well i feel real good i thank the staff at elvis presley and many many thanks to my many well wishers its great to know people care about you
2678167 ive no idea about this and if sections of the media in mumbai are talking about such a collaboration then they know something that i dont
2678168 both the parties respect the space that the other occupies but working together that seems a little far fetched
2678169 such talks are embarrassing to both mr bachchan and aamir first because both think the other is desirous of getting together and is therefore reluctant to refute the rumour the weeks best dressed
2678170 it is an entertaining film and i have made it for my grandmother and my grandfather the film is about positive attitude that is the usp of the film i am eager to take them to watch the film
2678171 we all are very happy with the movie i am very excited about the film as it is my first home production
2678172 ive been celibate for a year and starting to think i may never have a date again
2678173 men seem to look at me and think she went out with george clooney what chance have i got
2678174 whats encouraging to me is how many people are reacting to this incident
2678175 these people have a sense of ownership of these buoys i think at this point there will be enough people watching these buoys that no one will risk taking shots again
2678176 were looking at some different charges obviously this is a high dollar piece of equipment
2678177 lets catch someone and then i can tell you what the charges are and ill have a court date too
2678178 two more processor cores three times as much memory and twice the hard drive space
2678179 service by one of the modes whether through ordinary process or through registered process is sufficient to meet the requirements of provisions of the delhi rent control act
2678180 it is a baseless plea that unless the service is effected through ordinary process as well as through registered post the service is not complete
2678181 the ministry is introducing service level benchmarking slb in five key areas of functioning of the civic agencies and the cities will have to meet the standards to be able to access central funds under the jawaharlal nehru national urban renewal mission jnnurm
2678182 we are trying to make civic agencies focus on service delivery system
2678183 efficiency in redressal of customer complaints is a common indicator applicable for all the services the official said
2678184 one al qaeda in iraq terrorist died when he detonated a vehicle borne bomb
2678185 our grand old musharraf has not been passing on all the 1 billion dollar a year that the americans have been giving for the armed forces the army has been getting 250 million to 300 million dollars reimbursement for what they do but wheres the rest
2678186 they claim its been going in budget support but thats not the answer were talking about 700 million dollars a year missing the rest has been taken by mush for some scheme or other and weve got to find it
2678187 i think he musharraf has a slush fund being used for this and for some activity for the future
2678188 they spent all the money so we would have to borrow they didnt pass on the increased price of oil nor added a single extra megawatt of power in the last 10 years all these things were deliberately thought out so at the end of day they can turn round and tell the world look democracy doesnt deliver and step back in
2678189 the offer was on the table that you walk and you dont get prosecuted but ive had no returns so have had no choice but to go along with my partners more aggressive stance
2678190 if he does it it will be his last verdict against the people the peoples mandate and against pakistan
2678191 leaders at the district level have been asked to provide dates suitable to them so that yadav can hold interactive sessions with local workers during the tour
2678192 but this obviously did not happen once in the government we cannot indulge in a bare knuckle bargain on seat sharing it is therefore important for the sp to have an understanding with congress on seats before it moves ahead with anything else
2678193 i read shakespeare and the bible and i can shoot dice thats what i call a liberal education
2678194 the machinery moved no one is working and the parking lots have reopened people are shopping
2678195 i hate my life please help me i am going crazy right now
2678196 we got her away from him before it got worse
2678197 shell live with this for the rest of her life but we got her away from him
2678198 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation
2678199 the settlement gave those children a sense of security that could not be guaranteed if they had to sit across from him in the courtroom and testify before a jury
2678200 what happens outside the pool is no one elses business
2678201 this is something ive really been looking forward to since i was a young girl
2678202 i didnt really see kirsty on the other side of the pool but i gave everything i possibly had at the end
2678203 it wasnt about getting the world record back its about the olympics and an opportunity that you dont get very often
2678204 the victory was also australias 400th medal at the summer games
2678205 someone had told me at the beginning of the meet that whoever gets the first medal is australias 400th and i thought
2678206 i thought i had a pretty good chance of getting in contention with that but seeing hackett and his race before i thought he may have had a shot and i didnt know about the other sports so it was something i didnt really think about until after the race
2678207 immediately before rices race australian veteran grant hackett finished a disappointing sixth in the 400 freestyle which was won by park tae hwan of south korea the now retired ian thorpe won the 400 at the past two olympics and hackett was under pressure to extend the australian tradition
2678208 it wasnt what i was looking for i just didnt have the speed
2678209 we both mutually agreed that being together is something that probably wont work during this month and decided to have a break
2678210 i definitely sort of swim best when im nervous and excited and up emotionally
2678211 when the pressure is on i know that everything ive trained for is coming out thats what i wanted to know that i prepared well
2678212 ironically i won my first medal in athens in lane 1 in the 100 backstroke and now here too
2678213 its a tough race to finish and stephanie was just better finishing im very happy with my time
2678214 i wasnt overly impressed with the way we played to be quite honest but it just goes to show this sides a pretty gutsy side
2678215 this side seems to be able to do what they have to do to win a game
2678216 and it wasnt like we were playing a b grade side either we were playing a team that has led the competition for most of the year and theyre a good footy team so it was a gutsy win
2678217 manly coach des hasler said his team would learn from a game played with playoffs intensity
2678218 i know we can do a better job and there are things we can work on
2678219 melbourne are a very good side once they get in front its hard to play catch up against them but we certainly pushed them all the way
2678220 referees have got to get rid of tip sheets its distracting their line of thought and its distracting their performances theyll tell you that they havent got tip sheets but believe me they have
2678221 it is a logjam pretty much from fifth spot right through to 13th and you are playing for your survival

2678234 well the fund is pretty crappy hasnt done very well and is kinda expensive but i get a handsome commission if i can just convince you to buy this thing
2678235 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2678236 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2678237 the front loaded commission is attractive and there is a 12b 1 fee annual trailing commission paid to the broker as well

2678245 when it comes to sports we will always remain friends and nothing will effect our friendship even in such a scary event as shooting
2678246 we are friends indeed weve been shooting together for a long time she used to shoot for the soviet union
2678247 we are really friends and dont get mixed up in political things sports is not politics
2678248 the girls are really excited about this one they think its their best album yet

2678253 i need to refer to nine different books to create a basic character who doesnt suck
2678254 they wont take my fuel surcharge till they pry it from my cold dead hand
2678255 because fuel prices have been so highly volatile we elected to implement the fuel supplement as a separate charge so we would be in a position to promptly and effectively make adjustments to the amount based on the potential for ongoing changes to fuel prices
2678256 you should expect that fuel supplements are going to be around at least for a while
2678257 at this time we have no plans to eliminate the surcharge
2678258 weve chosen to use the supplement because it specifically highlights that issue for our guests
2678259 it ensures our guests know about it and know specifically what its designed to do
2678260 people need to be mindful of the fact that the fuel supplements being collected do not cover the record high fuel costs that we have experienced in recent years

2678266 well at least it doesnt smell as bad as it used to
2678267 i think its a great thing for tourism both short and long term
2678268 its just one more interesting way to draw attention to our community
2678269 the profits will now be hurt by the constant expense
2678270 we will get to see in all of its splendor what the banking and legal fees are
2678271 thats when the phone calls start when the market goes bad and they get a statement
2678272 to know if you have a bad planner is often not easy
2678273 you may not know till its too late and that can be scary
2678274 the net result was i was only about even after six months because he was making commissions on all the sales
2678275 youve given a financial planner all your financial data and probably invested quite a bit of time and effort
2678276 so be careful make sure youre changing for the right reason
2678277 the correct strategy is not to sell out and go to cash its to say this too shall pass and say what your strategy is for the next time the markets up
2678278 if the adviser doesnt have a strategy they can articulate to you you can pretty much guarantee that youll have poor results
2678279 our goal is to create a market response to the global seafood crisis by building a network of artisanal seafood producers both in the wild sector and aquaculture
2678280 we want to take them to new markets they could not reach on their own and build a branded presence
2678281 i want people to think about the producer to consumer connection
2678282 so cleanfish decided to step back and say cleanfish presents loch duart salmon
2678283 right now there is no sustainably produced farmed salmon anywhere in the world
2678284 cleanfish tries to label people as green who are doing something a little better than the bad guys but its still not sustainable
2678285 if sustainable seafood is to grow youve got to be talking about aquaculture because fisheries are not going to be expanding in the wild
2678286 and if we want positive change in aquaculture we need to recognize and reward the better practitioners
2678287 some choices they make arent on our seafood watch card but i dont want to let the perfect be the enemy of the good
2678288 cleanfish is building an important brand the more visible brands like cleanfish that there are the better off we all will be
2678289 its an icon of 20th century aviation and it was a piece of the puzzle
2678290 we had to respect it we didnt want the new terminal to have a looming presence

2678292 the ones that get used will remain and the ones that dont will go away
2678293 ninety nine percent of the time breach letters look like a piece of junk mail and people throw them away
2678294 that is no guarantee that that information is not out there and available to people to use for fraudulent purchases
2678295 our recommendation to consumers is that they never use debit or check cards
2678296 once that information has been compromised it provides criminals with a direct pipeline into their banking
2678297 if for some reason you dont get your statement on time that would be a red flag that something might not be right
2678298 each time i have waited for the real live person to come to the phone i have asked him or her what company they represent within seconds the person hangs up quickly if any question is asked about the source of the call whats the point of having a do not call list if you cant identify the company thats tormenting you
2678299 the majority of complaints that have occurred over the last several months can be tracked to rogue companies that we cannot identify that used national auto warranty services and others for phishing expeditions
2678300 they always came from unrecognizable numbers our numbers were trackable they came to us
2678301 if people in california have information about missouri based businesses they should contact us
2678302 did you know that one of our mutual funds just changed managers
2678303 even if people create greater supplies of environmentally preferable fish and even if there is more demand for it from consumers the seafood supply chain doesnt always cooperate
2678304 well have the resources to support an all out effort at product placement
2678305 seafood is a large industry but its very fragmented informal and artisanal so people have been hesitant from a business standpoint how do you build a business around that
2678306 sea change has begun to change the opinion investors have of fisheries as a place to look for investment
2678307 thats really important because the transition to sustainable methods requires capital

2678316 this report examines common obstacles to accountability for police abuse in fourteen large cities representing most regions of the nation

2678330 the drug issue from azerbaijan in the qualifying tournament was quite complicated and as you know for two months our team was quite perturbed by this issue
2678331 there were even discussions in the team whether it was wise for us to come to the beijing olympic games or not

2678333 rarely does a case get solved by only forensic evidence

2678345 after inspecting the stadium in the indian capital on sunday afc decided to shift both the matches to ambedkar stadium now the final between hosts india and defending champions tajikistan will be played at 1900 hours preceded by the third place playoff between dpr korea and myanmar at 1600 hours
2678346 the shift in the venue was necessitated after incessant rains in hyderabad turned the ground unplayable
2678347 we have three options now first it may be played tomorrow as scheduled either at the gachibowli stadium or lal bahadur stadium here the second option is to shift the venue to another city and play within a week the last option is to postpone the game for a month or two
2678348 the ground at gachibowli was unplayable the match then will not be decided by football skills it will be a shame if a final match of such an important tournament is decided by factors not connected to football
2678349 lal bahadur stadium was no better than gachibowli it will be an embarrassment for the afc and aiff if the final is played at lbs which is a cricket ground
2678350 i dont know which place we would like to play with rain everywhere in the country but dont tell me kolkata
2678351 it just shows how long ago it is i put on my manifesto when i stood for parliament in 1983 this constituency needs a member of parliament of youth and fresh ideas

2678353 i want aung san suu kyi not only to be released but to be in power in burma and thats one of the great causes of the 20th century every country should be a democracy and burma is one of these countries that has been prevented from doing so
2678354 there are still many interesting events which were not yet sold out
2678355 come along and be brave you never know how big that person could be next year
2678356 creating our 25th anniversary programme has been a mind bending forehead clutching joy
2678357 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2678358 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2678359 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2678360 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2678361 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2678362 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2678363 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2678364 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2678366 i just feel that the mayor came into office with a lot of promise a lot of potential some very unique gifts to help detroit be better
2678367 i think that what we have over the city now is this abyss of darkness that prevents us from moving forward and so i think the time has come for the mayor to resign
2678368 i believe that there comes a time when we as religious leaders have to speak with our prophetic voice even to powers that be and say what needs to be said
2678369 i think that the private conversations that people are having right now are all about a quick resolution or an expeditious resolution of this situation there are sentiments on both sides but i think that everybody wants this to be over
2678370 this has been a tough summer funerals of young people whose blood is being spilled in this city nonsensically and i just believe that there are other issues right now that are not getting any attention
2678371 we have an imploding educational system that is rife with corruption it appears
2678372 we have a brutal economy that is ravaging our region we have middle class families who have left the city and many who have left the state looking for greater opportunities
2678373 its hard to get things done these days its hard for people to get together and talk about anything
2678374 a lot of ministers have been preaching messages that revolve around themes of hope in the middle of despair
2678375 it shows wisdom for people not to be so reactive to everything
2678376 theyre not at everyones beck and call as to how and when they react i think it is wise to understand human frailty and to understand that people make mistakes so when you look at it from a spiritual standpoint the elements of forgiveness are always there
2678377 but youve got to love us enough to know when youre hurting us and right now were hurting our visible and conversational image worldwide has just reached an all time low and this has to stop i believe that the city is in gods hands and that we will survive
2678378 if you accept the creation story which i preach then you know that god always forms things out of chaos
2678379 fuck that naked baby angel yo and gimme 2 more buttery nipples
2678380 i was a desperate broke college drop out on the verge of a nervous break down when i decided enough was enough 14 months later i was making 19 562 mo and on my dream honeymoon in hawaii
2678381 i didnt want to be responsible for our second loss in the row i made some mistakes but i hung in there and battled through
2678382 leadoff walks make innings more difficult but he made some good pitches
2678383 i certainly got double plays in spots when i needed them
2678384 a lot of that was hitters just missing those hits i owe it to the guys behind me who turned the double plays
2678385 i just wanted to be careful and attack the inside i remember the last time i faced him he got a hit on a slider
2678386 since we have jacoby ellsbury nine and j d drew one rather than having our fastest guy get stuck behind our catcher and if they want to bring a lefty in it just seems to make some sense it may make them use an extra pitcher
2678387 i remember a lot of times hed come back to the bench even on a ball that wasnt a hit hed say i feel better hes taken some better passes more consistent
2678388 i know hes put in a lot of time and is working hard its starting to pay off for him
2678389 thats the biggest thing relax and be on time be ready to hit
2678390 i dont think it was any great scouting job or great coup on my part
2678391 arizona used the kid we traded to them in the dan haren deal with oakland so it wound up working for them we just knew carlos had a lot of ability and that he was injured in 2007 and that was the reason for the drop off in his play did we think hed have 31 homers in mid august not really but were thrilled and hes been a top performer for us
2678392 we went inside the numbers and spotted trends that we felt were favorable and worth the risk when we signed him as a free agent hes been a terrific pickup for us and we need him back healthy in order to get going with our season and to get where we want to go
2678393 you can do whatever you want in beijing but youre not going to see much of an effect

2678501 i spoke to bernie most days over the past 36 years
2678502 for my generation he was a direct link to show business in the 1950s and 60s in new york but beyond that he was just the best human being he loved talent and he loved show business yet what was most remarkable was the way bernie somehow kept his balance in a world where people do just awful things to each other he never gave up his heart he was one of the most decent and generous people ive ever known
2678503 i will miss bernie every day speaking to him and sharing with him was such a fundamental and meaningful part of my daily life that its a huge loss for me both personally and professionally with bernie it was impossible to separate those two
2678504 in this day and age we can all use a profound dose of the kind of values bernie carried with him every day the basics and fundamentals and joy of the entertainment business to him were always contagious
2678505 you take care of everything and get them ready for the day

2678513 theres an npr report on the situation in georgia and it tells us among other things that tonight the cell phone network of georgia is virtually out and that georgian television is playing that nasty 1984 john milius movie called red dawn
2678514 it was a wonderful kind of artistic event and the twin towers provided the stage
2678515 i knew the story like many people who live in the city just as an anecdote that you collect or absorb by living here almost like a folk memory
2678516 and the fact that his life well philippe would say it wasnt at stake but everyone else knows that it was
2678517 one of the things that struck me as i made man on wire was that we were sort of re creating a new york that i wished still existed
2678518 its all caught up in the destruction of the twin towers ultimately
2678519 and in fact the new york of 1974 and the world trade center walk is a world id much rather live in i guess theres nostalgia about that which maybe is a dangerous emotion but nostalgia also has a kind of ache to it
2678520 it does bring back and evoke this city that we are in danger of losing completely
2678521 i felt that the choice of not engaging with the destruction of those buildings was essential
2678522 because everybodys going to be engaged with it anyway its the big fact the big documentary fact if you like its the defining fact perhaps
2678523 and the idea for me making the film was to get people not beyond it how could you but at least to a point where you could enjoy the towers being built and you could enjoy this sort of fantasy thats being projected onto them by this obsessed frenchman
2678524 you see the buildings really almost exclusively through his eyes in the film and that then becomes a legitimate way of bringing them back to life i think youre seeing them through someone who knew them knew their secrets and their secret noises because he spent so much time there as they were being finished as they were being built
2678525 if you told it as it was with the people involved you couldnt do any better than that
2678526 its a struggle to be a filmmaker in the u s and ive just given up on it now

2678540 we are in a state of self defence against foreign aggression this aggression is coming from the land air and maritime forces of the russian federation we expect world leaders and the world community to act
2678541 in georgia and in russia and the whole world it is now clear that the georgian leaderships aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2678542 from a legal point of view russias actions in south ossetia are totally legitimate and what is more absolutely necessary
2678543 the 27 countries of europe are determined to firmly ask for the cessation of the conflict immediately and a withdrawal of forces to previously held international positions

2678580 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2678581 i again call on the government of russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2678582 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2678583 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2678584 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors
2678585 unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
2678586 the current escalation of military conflict resulted in part from the lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate un mandate
2678587 we have a very strong broad based economy we have very strong banks
2678588 the australian situation is slightly different to world situation and i think were probably both in distance and in terms of our financial institutions somewhat isolated from the world though still part of the overall financial community
2678589 while the issues are serious i dont think theyre going to bring down any one country
2678590 there is increasing demand for the worlds limited resources of energy particularly oil food and what i think will be a critical issue in the future water
2678591 i think the failure of the doha round of negotiations is a tragedy for the world because if it had succeeded it would have generated additional wealth to the world that could have been reportedly the size of the current chinese economy

2678598 talks on irans nuclear program in geneva indicated a shift of the us policy toward iran in line with the james baker lee hamilton recommendations of 2006
2678599 the probable outcome is that washington will refrain from military action to forestall iranian nuclear arms developments while tehran will refrain from disrupting washingtons potemkin village in iraq in this exchange iran gives up nothing of importance for the rage of the iraqi shiites will only wax over time tehran retains the option to stir things up in iraq whenever it chooses to do so its capacity to do so will increase with time as iraq grows less stable
2678600 iran wants an independent stable and tranquil iraq in its neighborhood
2678601 we may never quite know the extent to which any role washington would have played in ensuring that the government led by prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was not unseated by turkeys constitutional court in the trial regarding the alleged islamist agenda of the ruling justice development party akp
2678602 the united states is deeply disturbed by reports that pakistani president musharraf has taken extra constitutional actions and has imposed a state of emergency a state of emergency would be a sharp setback for pakistani democracy and takes pakistan off the path toward civilian rule
2678603 i saw maddie i know it was her i saw the unique blemish in her eye
2678604 her eyes met mine as i walked past and thats when i saw the little blemish in her right eye it was like a little fleck i wanted to grab her or shout out her name and see what reaction i would get but i was afraid to do anything and cause a scene a huge ruckus would have erupted and it could have made things worse i decided to get a good look to make sure it was her so i could come back to england and report it

2678606 stung by the portuguese men of law evidence from files on the madeleine mccann investigation show how badly her parents were treated by portuguese police
2678607 the statements from the whole group result in a total lack of coherence from which we easily conclude that theyre all lying
2678608 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible to include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents lack of communication is torture
2678609 her eyes met mine as i walked past and thats when i saw the little blemish in her right eye it was like a little fleck
2678610 madeleine came here for lunch with her parents not long before she disappeared
2678611 i dont know if this guy took a picture of madeleine its impossible to say but he took a lot of photographs on the beach

2678614 shabbos may be spiritual and religious in nature but lets face it a group of teens on their own in a foreign country there is bound to be some activity because we were all on hormonal overdrive so i was a bit surprised with my reaction to our first shabbos in country it began with a walk from the base to the old city the kotel was our destination i remember parts of it well the conversation i had with a very dear friend stands out to me some of the buildings and people do too but it wasnt until we began walking over the rooftops in the old city that i began to notice that there was something special in the air it wasnt until we got closer to the kotel itself that i really began to feel something it was the connection that i had felt there earlier in the week the bond that i felt towards all the other jews in the plaza who were davening and the unmistakable feeling that g d was there with me us them everyone it was stronger than it had been before it was almost surreal i felt like i was in some kind of science fiction movie in which i was traveling through time and space it sounds goofy but i really did feel like i was standing in the same place that i had been in thousands of years before and at the same time experiencing it for the first time and more than anything else i was pleased to feel like i was part of the group i was in on the secret i was happy to be able to daven with kavanah and real belief and not to sitting there waiting for maariv to end it wasnt a chore to be endured but a pleasure it was just one more piece of chain that brought me back into the fold that made me believe again this is a story that really could be much longer and much more eloquent and to some extent i feel that i am not doing it justice because how i can share something like this how can i explain something that tugs at places so deep inside you dont know that they exist if i was a man of brevity i would end this tale here but there is too much to share too much to say and i need to add another moment or two to my story the next morning at shacharit i was a little disappointed because that feeling from the night before was fading it was like an amazing dream the kind that you wish would never end so you try to go back to sleep and get it back hold onto it so that it doesnt disappear but trying to do that with a dream is a little bit like grabbing a fistful of water no matter how tight your grip it spills out from a million different places i can remember daydreaming lost in thought of the night before we had danced with reckless abandon and sung out loud almost shouting the prayers but still with reverence there was a power and an energy as i look back i realize that it was a little bit like being buzzed there was a high and i fed off of it all week i waited for shabbos to return so that i could experience it again and each time i got lost in the moment i began to wonder if this feeling was going to be limited in time and place i got my answer a little later it was tisha bav and we were in the hills overlooking the old city we read eicha and discussed the burning of the temple the sack of jerusalem and the moment made a huge impact upon me i could look out on the city and picture the flames in my mind jerusalem was burning i could hear the screams of the women and children smell the fear and feel the greed of the invaders i might have cried but i couldnt tell you for certain i was so caught up in the moment so enthralled and so amazed that something could move me that way the next day we returned to the kotel and again i lost myself in the crowd but this time i made my way amongst the crowd to the wall itself and just lay my head against it my eyes were closed and my hands caressed the stone time passed and the end of the trip grew closer i began to get anxious about returning to los angeles because jerusalem had become home to me if i could have i would have stayed i would have stayed indefinitely
2678615 the dow jones was up over 300 points and that sets up a good day for our market in a broader sense although there are going to be a raft of winners and losers
2678616 the oil price being down us5 a barrel is certainly going to weigh down the energy sector although banks should continue to do well

2678619 hes like a bull you cant just go straight at him and expect to beat him you have to go in and frustrate him
2678620 that was something i worked on a lot with my coaches
2678621 they kept yelling at me to circle circle circle that was the best roger ever looked he hits really hard and i was just smart enough to not go straight at him
2678622 kenny mixed in a lot of kicks kept going high and going low we didnt want to let roger get into his comfort zone ill tell you what im glad he fought roger now and not a year from now
2678623 he had a good game plan and fought a very technical fight i was doing good things in the first round but then i went back to my old habits and tried to chase him down being the stubborn kid that i am
2678624 b j was here tonight all fired up cheering for gsp they both really want that fight im gonna let that fight happen after that ill figure out what will happen at 155
2678625 im in the top company and im in the top division ive just got to keep winning i dont want to wait around while penn fights st pierre i want to keep fighting
2678626 i was never saying the ufc is bad if it wasnt them if it wasnt for their 40 million in the hole we wouldnt be there we wouldnt be looked at as professional athletes
2678627 all i can say as a retirement plan we can only do this so long as a business decision you cant argue about this all business if someone offered you something better you would do that anyone would thats that i have nothing bad to say about the ufc
2678628 in my mind i have a goal and my goal is to be at my best on that night which will bring me the gold medal
2678629 when it comes down to it you still have to run the 10 hurdles
2678630 if youre going to beat me youre going to have to go 12 7 low 12 7
2678631 ive had some people that work here at the university say that they feel like ill win
2678632 he trusts his training hes extremely confident and excited for the challenge that is dangerous with an athlete like terrence you dont put a tiger like that in a corner he wants to come out fighting
2678633 what happens outside the pool is no one elses business
2678634 this is something ive really been looking forward to since i was a young girl
2678635 i didnt really see kirsty on the other side of the pool but i gave everything i possibly had at the end
2678636 it wasnt about getting the world record back its about the olympics and an opportunity that you dont get very often
2678637 someone had told me at the beginning of the meet that whoever gets the first medal is australias 400th and i thought
2678638 i thought i had a pretty good chance of getting in contention with that but seeing hackett and his race before i thought he may have had a shot and i didnt know about the other sports so it was something i didnt really think about until after the race
2678639 it wasnt what i was looking for i just didnt have the speed
2678640 we both mutually agreed that being together is something that probably wont work during this month and decided to have a break
2678641 i definitely sort of swim best when im nervous and excited and up emotionally
2678642 im definitely an emotional swimmer i dont swim well at the little meets because theres just no excitement id rather not be there
2678643 when the pressure is on i know that everything ive trained for is coming out thats what i wanted to know that i prepared well
2678644 ironically i won my first medal in athens in lane 1 in the 100 backstroke and now here too
2678645 its a tough race to finish and stephanie was just better finishing im very happy with my time
2678646 yo quiero que gane jap n en los ltimos a os han jugado muy bien as que espero que ganen ellos
2678647 thats a lie i never threatened anybody with lawsuits i saw what i believed to be a civil rights violation
2678648 based on my training there was no probable cause for them to search that trunk
2678649 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2678650 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2678651 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2678652 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2678653 he was good at heating and air conditioning but his passion was police work
2678654 my suspicion was aroused as the driver had applied the brakes regularly causing the meter to jump
2678655 i took a taxi recently and felt suspicious when the driver kept pressing the horn regularly everytime he pressed the horn the meter jumped
2678656 the meters can be easily tampered making it difficult for the authorities to detect them tampering can be done to the wires and not to the meters
2678657 this is because taxi metres are using a digital system based on sensors tampering cannot be detected altough the taxis had been checked by puspakom
2678658 the usual meters cost rm400 500 each while the satellite system will cost about rm2 000 it is widely used in japan can also detect the location of taxis and find road maps
2678659 i am disappointed that workshops which did the meter tampering were only fined rm300 while the taxi drivers permits were revoked instantly
2678660 this situation had happened before where taxi licences were sold at rm5 000 rm10 000 on the black market
2678661 however we conduct regular operations at random based on information received from the public
2678662 cvlb had so far revoked 100 taxi permits after the drivers had committed several offences
2678663 the drug issue from azerbaijan in the qualifying tournament was quite complicated and as you know for two months our team was quite perturbed by this issue
2678664 there were even discussions in the team whether it was wise for us to come to the beijing olympic games or not
2678665 i personally had a role in calming down the emotions of the team members

2678713 the indian partition of 1947 and its fall out haunt both the countries and communities to this date and jis lahore nahin dekhya is both an emotional story from those times as well as a strong comment on the then prevalent socio political scene sikandar mirza migrates to pakistan and is allotted a haweli by the custodian he and his family are shocked to find the old hindu landlady ratan ki maa still in the house who didnt leave for india like many others did a victim of hate violence and tragedy she had lost everything but not the ability to give love and affection the story charts the relationship of ratan ki maa with the mirza family at one level at another level the story shows us how goons try to use religion against rattan ki maa for ulterior motive how priest are wooed to get legitimacy for their intentions and actions one day the old lady dies and this is when the narrative reaches its climax demonstrating the clash of greed and fundamentalism versus sanity and love for fellow human beings
2678714 its really sad after the celebration of the opening ceremonies which were the best opening ceremonies ive ever been at
2678715 to the best of my knowledge this is a random action and not targeted at americans its just that you dont expect something to happen in a country like this
2678716 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2678717 the chinese government will try not to let this event have a serious impact on u s china relations
2678718 of course its a little scary but any time you have so many coming together there is a chance that something like this would happen
2678719 im very surprised because all of the locals we have met say its very safe
2678720 the bravery of young sophie and the delezio family is an inspiration mr iemma said

2678725 i know the air looks bad but i dont know if it is as bad as it looks
2678726 i didnt feel it maybe tonight i will be coughing a little but thats normal
2678727 i was looking at a newspaper picture of the horses in hong kong site of the olympic equestrian events with swamp coolers in front of them
2678728 but this definitely was among my top 10 hardest races
2678729 i got goose bumps in heat and thats probably not a good thing
2678730 i have ridden in conditions like that tons of times but never for so long it was so humid that going up hills you just couldnt breathe and the sweat wouldnt come off you
2678731 it feels like you have hot cream all over your body once you go full gas you cannot breathe
2678732 ive doing it for all the 40 year old moms out there
2678733 i totally get it but i dont like how the fans arent getting it
2678734 the fans love the gymnastics that theyre seeing they know that what these girls are doing is quite amazing and that shawn johnson is the real deal and that nastia liukins bar routine is amazing however theyre screaming for the performance and then the scores flash and theres no reaction
2678735 but i was sad to see the 10 0 system go
2678736 i feel after so many years everyone identifies the 10 with the sport of gymnastics now its like weve given the branding away
2678737 it takes a long time to create something that is associated with the sport
2678738 now the fans are confused because an open score doesnt mean too much what does a 16 mean is it out of 100 or 50 or what is the highest score you can get
2678739 i said to coach bob bowman i wanted to sing on the medal podium but i just couldnt stop crying
2678740 youre going to look back just like i do now and man memories are all youve got left and friendship
2678741 they used to be extremely arrogant and it was kind of a turnoff for the world
2678742 the first thing i noticed about watching them play against turkey on july 31 they were actually pretty friendly and were sort of respectful to the referees it actually depends on the people themselves and the roster is completely different from what it was four years ago or even two years ago
2678743 in this horrible situation who can say ill even be alive in 2012
2678744 a lot of my friends neighbors people i work with in the sports world have been abducted hijacked or even killed
2678745 even when her mum used to ask her to get some stuff from the shops she would go running for it it was all built in
2678746 chad bradford shows up goes 40 pitches and gets a win i give chad a lot of credit in that moment
2678747 there was some ugly things and there were some great things
2678748 theres a lot of positives to draw from as we lose these tough ones like that and that ones just about as bad as they get but that aint a hell of a lot different than several others weve had just like that
2678749 have i not commanded you be strong and courageous do not be terrified do not be discouraged for the lord your god will be with you wherever you go

2678877 our navy sailors have been assigned the task of preventing arms and other military supplies from reaching georgia by sea
2678878 these reports do not correspond with reality a coastal blockade would mean war with georgia we are not in a state of war with georgia
2678879 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of good will and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2678880 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2678881 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2678882 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2678883 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2678884 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2678885 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people

2678896 i was the one who suggested give herbie a kick
2678897 i feel very very bad about it i had no idea and campo gave me the evil eyes when he walked into the dressing shed
2678898 theres not a real lot to say theres a lot to feel about it
2678899 we all played a part in it attitude thats probably a big part of it
2678900 we talked about having a defensive focus at half time
2678901 if we have got 17 men out there that are willing to work hard for each other and theyre focused on what they need to do then you can get a result and certainly things clicked today
2678902 is not about georgia anymore its about america its values america stands up for those freedom loving nations and supports them thats what america is all about
2678903 now we see georgia has found a use for these weapons and for the special forces that were trained with the help of international instructors
2678904 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil

2678930 los ltimos d as con luz en forma continua fueron los de las fiestas de la virgen del carmen en julio de ah para adelante estamos durmiendo a oscuras
2678931 cometimos un error excesivo paternalismo como ocurri con la f brica de bloques y la ebanister a hoy deber an ser las nicas de ese tipo en el medio atrato y no hay nada
2678932 mientras la agencia presidencial para la acci n social manej el proyecto de bojay durante casi siete meses todos los d as durante 6 horas hubo electricidad y el acueducto funcionaba
2678933 yo dije desde el principio que hab a contratos no viables como el de los ebanistas los estaban tumbando por que los altos costos de la zona no compensaban el contrato
2678934 esta es una sociedad adormecida con autoridades a las que les falta responsabilidad

2678937 ya firmamos el contrato de comodato pero no se ha dado la firma del ministerio de minas y sin eso no podemos acceder al subsidio
2678938 i walked up and asked him what he was doing
2678939 he said you and your muscleman dont scare me ill protect myself
2678940 that was what i was trying to do 50 years ago and the attorney general of texas stopped me
2678941 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2678942 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2678943 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2678944 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2678945 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be
2678946 ya es bastante no es justo no hay derecho a que por un servicio que creo estar prestando adecuadamente que implica dedicaci n permanente y que afecta la familia la vida personal y la tranquilidad haya una constante persecuci n intentos permanentes de ataques
2678947 he intentado hacer mi trabajo de la mejor manera con la transparencia honestidad y responsabilidad de toda la vida que quienes me conocen han visto en mi funci n de procurador de antioquia como procurador judicial como director de la fiscal a de medell n como magistrado auxiliar para que ahora con cada comportamiento con cada nueva investigaci n que se pretende iniciar surja otra situaci n creo que ya se ha pagado suficientemente el precio

2678949 if the shock of the lightning sounds instant and compelling its because it was written and recorded dead fast
2678950 its basically a demo and has retained its energy theres a lot to be said for that the first time you record something is always the best
2678951 on the album i wanted a sound that was more hypnotic more driving songs you would maybe have to connect to to feel
2678952 oh yeah well i have to go to the doctor later so
2678953 no eric the and i were playing around last night and he sat on my chest and i think he broke something
2678954 yeah i cant really breathe i dont know about ribs but my sternum hurts a lot and my doctor was talking about checking for a collapsed lung

2678957 fifteen ltte terrorists were killed when the army made a daring advance this morning before first light and without sustaining any damage to our own troops the ministry said
2678958 when i told people i was going out to utah i got a similar question if there are any democrats in utah and i said you know there are more than you think
2678959 weve seen it happen in colorado montana is getting close
2678960 we might not make it there this november in utah but together we can get there
2678961 no matter how much they spend were confident that barack obamas support of higher taxes and opposition to the second amendment when contrasted with john mccains support of traditional values and lifetime of putting his country above all else will make his campaign a nonstarter with utahs voters
2678962 utah deserves to have a voice just as much as california and new york
2678963 were banding together as a team to lift up the bachmans and mccutcheons
2678964 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred and for their loss and for everything they are going through we are a family and we will get through this together as a family
2678965 their marriage last year made hugh happier than i have ever seen him
2678966 i never met elisabeths parents but i have been told they are wonderful people our thoughts and prayers go out to the family at this time
2678967 i talked to hugh last week and wished him well and wished him luck its awful sickening news
2678968 it looked to me that it went into a nosedive suddenly spiraled down and hit the beach
2678969 he just loved fishing and flying he was just very happy he had a love of life
2678970 just to see him die right in front of me that hurt a lot
2678971 today everyone is feeling that the accident might have been his destiny
2678972 but we just dont believe hes gone were never going to get to see his smile again
2678973 my country tis for thee to make your women free this is our plea
2678974 the basis of a grand movement for attaining the civil social political and religious rights of women
2678975 the doors of the old tabernacle were closed to our ministrations
2678976 the western vote was generally viewed as a privilege not an inherent right
2678977 western women werent bound by the same cultural restrictions structures and prejudices prevalent in eastern society
2678978 often she had to do mens work face the unknown and build a culture of independence which gave her the right to have a say
2678979 i think he should serve time in jail he needs to pay restitution he needs to lose his drivers license
2678980 twenty years ago it was really an exception to see victims speak at sentencings
2678981 now its an exception not to see them speak out
2678982 it seems to me where you have a victim who is willing to testify in the case and the city isnt making any basis for a reduction that it is not appropriate for me to accept the plea
2678983 im the only one who had the nerve to stand up to make sure he doesnt get leniency
2678984 my concern is that prosecutors will listen to victims who advocate harsh punishment and are not as likely to listen to victims who are arguing for leniency
2678985 theres no reason the victims shouldnt be excluded until theyve testified themselves
2678986 at first i thought victims would want long sentences but being treated with respect and fairness is most important
2678987 were re victimizing victims for making them think they have rights and then not enforcing it
2678988 we have these promised rights but it didnt work the way it was intended
2678989 now we have a third party we have to figure out how it will work
2678990 we certainly would not want this to happen to anyone else
2678991 i will follow this through until the end it really needs to go this far
2678992 at first i thought victims would want long sentences but being treated with respect and fairness is most important
2678993 we just want to say we have the right to live here as much as anybody
2678994 we are actively engaged in pursuing several other potential sponsorship opportunities
2678995 go to let us down and there confound their language that they may not understand one anothers speech
2678996 obviously his version gets the same message across but with fewer words
2678997 as the reality of the times take hold we come to terms with the sadness we bare
2678998 initially i was foxed because i could not understand the order of the teams appearance but then i was told that the teams entries were based on the chinese alphabet and not the english one
2678999 it is risky because people expect you to just do one thing
2679000 im going to take the chance and show what else is a part of me
2679001 with idol you only get a minute or so to sing a song
2679002 you cant show all your talent in that moment with each experience you try to show more and more and more
2679003 i would look at beyonce because she was doing acting and singing and im like how the hell can she do that
2679004 i loved every moment of it because thats what i dreamed of doing
2679005 i used to practice my little moves for my videos in the mirror in my room with a brush in my hand i was going to live up every single minute of those 22 hours
2679006 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president
2679007 made keeping whites on the hook the most sacred article of the post 60s black identity
2679008 its hard to imagine america responding to small ball when we have all these problems
2679009 his image of himself was always the handsome celebrity flyboy
2679010 entire system from the dams that capture water to generate power to the wires distributing electricity to peoples homes is maxed out
2679011 is comparable to other north american jurisdictions according to internationally established performance measures
2679012 to honour persons who have been of great service to their community
2679013 we saved money in drydock costs down time and we are committed to providing a service
2679014 sure its dangerous ive had scares quite a few times but if i had another job i wouldnt know what to do its a challenge makes life more interesting
2679015 the ghosts wont let anyone who isnt a family descendant stay there
2679016 rode south westerly winds at 20 25 knots with gusts of 30 to finish far ahead of the pack
2679017 youre so tied up with talking to people and thanking them for taking time to come into the store that i hope we havent forgotten to serve anybody
2679018 most of it probably fell within those three or four hours
2679019 were here to put on a show and were here to do the best
2679020 there would have to be a separate pair of boots for the field for each of the greenhouses and each place where chicken houses are located
2679021 there are lots of good things outdoors you know not just bad things
2679022 the big abattoirs process about a quarter million chickens a week we process 400
2679023 the first thing we are going to do is establish a preschool for the area
2679024 so why not create a place for them to come to even for the after school programs and things like that
2679025 thats how you know its good to plant its moist enough to hold the roots
2679026 when they pay high prices they pass on an increase to their poorest people who can no longer afford it
2679027 if you dont put it in the ground you dont have a chance
2679028 as every drought goes on its just another nail in the coffin to a small country town out here
2679029 his loss hurt beyond description and still brings tears when i think of our time together
2679030 jacks passing was a very sad occasion for me because he and i shared similar interests he was a virtual icon for the rest of the family as well
2679031 we are supposed to be getting acquainted with our pilot and navigator but i havent seen them yet im waiting around till he the pilot comes over and breaks the ice
2679032 that garden was a great comfort to my mother after dad died and she continued to tend the potatoes carrots and cabbages which grew to be an enormous size at least it was something living she was left with
2679033 we are preparing for our trip across the atlantic in a hudson im in a good crew an aussie pilot and two canuck wags and i think we shall be ok
2679034 this coastal command is a great layout a lot of work and a great headache too much water but a lot of fun and a good experience it gets pretty foggy hard for flying sometimes but i expect to be here until the end of august
2679035 this wont be a very long letter as im dead tired just came down from another six hour trip looking for submarines my eyes are sore from the ocean as it was just like glass today id sooner do the night trips the subs sure hang around the convoys i saw my first big one today it seemed to fill the whole horizon
2679036 im getting to like the old rear turret and have lots of fun the ocean is full of porpoises so the pilot says and we often sight schools of them i didnt do anything else but fly and sleep the last week
2679037 it wont be long before we finish here three more weeks and then i guess its overseas but im still hoping to get some leave i sure would like to see you and the kids once more better go to bed as i have a 5 hr trip again at 8 oclock tomorrow morning
2679038 on august 10 1942 approximately between 1 00 a m and 1 30 a m i was at my house at which time i was half asleep in bed i heard the roar of an aircraft which awoke me i went to the window and first observed a red glow against the sky outlining the foothills which are about a mile away accompanied by this glow were puffs of white light which seemed to explode and then die out following this was a red flare which lit the sky right up with a sort of heat wave effect in a few minutes i heard two explosions which jarred our house in about five minutes the light went out this being followed by a light rain
2679039 doug will come back when this war is over but i wont
2679040 has been negligent toward our friends ineffective with our adversaries disinterested in the challenges that matter in peoples lives and incapable of advancing our interests in the region
2679041 so my policy towards the americas will be guided by the simple principle that whats good for the people of the americas is good for the united states
2679042 obama will pursue a program of aggressive principled and sustained diplomacy in the americas with a focus on advancing freedom as franklin roosevelt described it political freedom freedom from want and freedom from fear
2679043 we must put forward a vision of democracy that goes beyond the ballot box that is how we can support democracy that is strong and sustainable not just on an election day but in the day to day lives of the people of the americas
2679044 we cannot ignore suffering to our south nor stand for the globalization of the empty stomach
2679045 direct his attorney general and homeland security secretary to meet with their latin american and caribbean counterparts in the first year of his presidency to reproduce a regional strategy to combat drug trafficking domestic and transnational gang activity and organized crime
2679046 increase research and development in clean coal technology the next generation of sustainable biofuels and in wind solar and nuclear energy
2679047 an alliance of the americas will only succeed if it is founded on a bedrock of mutual respect its time to turn the page on the arrogance in washington and the anti americanism across the region that stands in the way of progress
2679048 we can renew our leadership in the hemisphere we can win the support not just of governments but of the people of the americas

2679054 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province brigadier dawson said

2679081 i know a girl whos tough but sweet i want caaandy
2679082 i really dig this spot because it reminds me of that little market i used to go to as a kid run by a family small enough to have really
2679083 now i know technology and everything but what does this mean reads please ask for assistance oh for fucks sake

2679085 the inn above tide is nothing short of breathtaking and romantic
2679086 a place for slimeballs to cheat on their wives while still in town
2679087 uh oh not one of these wannabe hipster hotels again
2679088 youve always wanted to stay at the clift so i got it for another two nights
2679089 lets go back in and ask them to call one for us
2679090 they couldnt get through to a company so i came out to help
2679091 this is a beautiful clean shop with soft lighting soft music and a nice owner name betty
2679092 its just one of those deals with the way the cautions fell
2679093 we were at the other side of the track when the caution fell and the 59 ambrose that really helped him with track position and he did a good job
2679094 we kind of got back in the traffic a little and i was open for a green white chequered because we had a lot of fuel still in the car it didnt happen the top five is ok but i really felt with the pole today and the way the car was that we had a car capable of winning today
2679095 it was a little bit tight going into the corner but would go loose off up in traffic it was clean air i think it wouldve been no problem but the way the yellows fell we got back in the pack and that was it
2679096 you get close to that top five cars and there wasnt really a big enough difference to make a move you had to wait for someone to make a mistake the restarts were really interesting though especially that last one with those guys that hadnt pitted
2679097 we were passing on the grass all kinds of stuff it was really interesting
2679098 obviously a 78 point lead is pretty healthy but were going to have to still try to gain points on helio
2679099 we need an 82 point lead to have it sewn up after the next race at sonoma that would be nice but in all reality i think well be battling for the championship to the last race
2679100 at that point i saw the lights on the dash and they were all lit
2679101 the fuel meter was off a little bit but it wasnt off so far that i expected to get to the finish line first
2679102 weve got to start capitalizing when we have cars that can win races
2679103 dixon had a bit of speed on us but i think we had a better car in traffic it was between him and i to win the race and its just unfortunate that we didnt
2679104 my car was just a little too loose on the last stint to make the move
2679105 we planned on it cooling down late in the race and we knew we would be money on the last 50 laps
2679106 if you keep your foot on the throttle the engine wont respond because its trying to suck more fuel and theres nothing there what you try to do is lift a little bit to make sure you keep some revs thats what i did when it coughed i kept trying to step on and off to see if i could get more fuel unfortunately it didnt happen
2679107 they said there were a few guys who had gone on an alternate strategy they were fighting pretty hard i didnt think coming out from this that we had enough to win it definitely took him having a problem with fuel in order for us to win it
2679108 i still cant believe how close we were we were just a few hundred yards short
2679109 coming through turns 3 and 4 and watching helio run out of fuel with a few hundred feet to go was pretty special i must say its nice to be in that position
2679110 we lost a lot of spots in the pits on that last stop
2679111 die anlage ist sehr gepflegt und ein schmuckst ck in aufenau und auch interessant f r den fremdenverkehr ich m chte bei dieser gelegenheit dem verein und allen danken die sich um die pflege dieser anlage verdient machen und uns helfen
2679112 for a number of years community members had to travel outside of their area to access recreational activities and to have meetings
2679113 excellent opportunities for children and youth not only in this community but throughout dartmouth
2679114 there are going to be lots of possibilities both recreational and educational for youth to develop skills
2679115 its unfortunate we had to fight so long and so hard
2679116 but it was kind of like the story of the little train that could i love that story
2679117 we found a wide base of community support and pressed ahead
2679118 most of the people who use the facility are not from the town
2679119 almost everything in this town was made by people who said this needs to happen and went ahead and did it
2679120 they are the glue that holds rural nova scotia together
2679121 this generation of women have really sculpted what rural nova scotia communities look like
2679122 they are the glue that holds rural nova scotia communities together their volunteerism raising families and making small communities throughout western nova scotia interesting and vibrant places to live
2679123 these are brave women most were poor but they knew how to get things done with nothing
2679124 if you didnt grow up with these women as your peers how would you get to know them
2679125 this book says we are here we have put in our time and we will continue these women are real role models
2679126 it definitely wouldnt be information that was intended for him or for anyone for that matter
2679127 the information you are in possession of is obviously sensitive and sharing that outside of you having it now could jeopardize the safety of members
2679128 im not sure what the call out was for but i dont want to see somebody get hurt over this
2679129 it seems like a rather significant screw up im not sure if the screw up is with bell or aliant the provider of our pager or whether its even related
2679130 i think his number was probably put in there in error
2679131 im sure there is limited information as to what you need to bring and where you need to meet
2679132 the vast majority of times the rcmp tactical squad is sitting off somewhere in the dark and never seen
2679133 manju is not only the pride of the film industry of sikkim but the whole scheduled caste fraternity is proud of her achievement
2679134 this is not believed to be a random act and it is believed that the parties are known to one another
2679135 the victim and witnesses were not co operative with the police
2679136 i broke my neck and hit my head on the steering wheel
2679137 shell find that she needs things she hasnt even thought of yet
2679138 there are gadgets so i can brush my teeth and feed myself eventually ill be able to go home to my family you just have to make the best of what youve got
2679139 if theres a way to do it im going to figure it out
2679140 by announcing these changes in the middle of the summer and giving people just three weeks to comment the conservatives appear to be making a half hearted attempt at public consultation
2679141 the minister must allow a more reasonable and generous timeline
2679142 right now were still planning to keep the close date for consultations in august
2679143 then well take a look at them so that we can propose what the legislation will look like before the nominations close
2679144 and its what other nations think of when they see the canadian maple leaf
2679145 a symbol of our countrys commitment to building a more safe and secure world
2679146 youtube is an amazing video sharing site its great to get everyone together

2679148 he never left behind the ones he made in high school
2679149 that was your trademark we can still see your smiling face happy go lucky smile not a care in the world
2679150 i dont know the family or anything im just here to help if i can to make sure those people dont get near the family
2679151 could never stand still there was a whole world to see and everywhere he went he brought light and joy
2679152 that would be a painful thing for our association to go through
2679153 were trying to work behind the scenes to avoid it
2679154 he practiced endlessly and he got a beautiful sound out of his guitar and his banjo today you see any number of fabulous guitar players but back then there were only a handful and he was one
2679155 one new york sunday i took a double decker fifth avenue bus down to washington square where i had been told people sang folk songs
2679156 i didnt dare play that first day but i became part of that crowd and did not miss a sunday for years
2679157 every time we appeared on a tv show the set was palm trees and bananas or pilings barrels and docks or all five
2679158 he had an interesting voice rather than a beautiful voice
2679159 erik brought new energy and new harmonies to the group he was good for them and they were good for him
2679160 the most vital issue of our time the thoughtful raising of children
2679161 brought folk music to people who had never heard it before
2679162 someone was riding it up my driveway and i petted it that was it i wanted to ride it
2679163 the hardest thing for morgan was overcoming the fear of falling off
2679164 it took a year and a half she didnt want to go faster than a walk or a trot but then she progressed very quickly and now rides confidently and handles the cart in driving classes
2679165 i love to ride them brush them just be with them
2679166 and i sure dont mind getting down and dirty we clean the manure and fill the water buckets saddle and bridle the horses for younger kids and then we get a chance to ride
2679167 they earn free rides through the time they give me this can be an expensive sport i paid their entry fee to salmon river as a thank you for helping me so much
2679168 i brush her a lot bring her carrots give her lots of attention she tried to bite me when i first got here but not so much now
2679169 the horse has a baby face and attitude just like me
2679170 but shes really affectionate i pay more attention to her than the other horses here
2679171 the animals all have horsonality ivy bites demi bucks alvin is pushy he doesnt respect a persons space hell bump you and push you away
2679172 its so great being on the horse riding it doing things together with it weve become totally devoted to them i sure dont mind cleaning up after them
2679173 i have three siblings at home all younger and this is quiet compared to hearing them scrapping yelling and crying
2679174 riding a horse is a lot more work than driving in a cart behind the horse riding is an exhilarating feeling
2679175 id rather give up a show to be here riding for a weekend

2679178 last season will continue to loom large over us until we win a game people wont forget it until that happens
2679179 i think it is fair to say we looked like a team with seven new signings as a team i think doncaster were more comfortable playing with each other
2679180 i am aware that we need to gel pretty quickly there are games a lot of games that we can win this season not like last season when the feeling was we were going to be beaten
2679181 i would call it a good start after 10 games not after 90 minutes
2679182 we made a poor start last season so we wanted to get a first win under our belts as quickly as possible
2679183 i thought that marcus tudgay was excellent and akpo sodje showed just what a player he can be for us
2679184 wednesday didnt have to work hard because they were soft goals
2679185 we took the game to wednesday in the second half but it was too big an obstacle to overcome
2679186 a mere extension of the exercise will not guarantee the registration of our citizens who are eligible to register the electoral commission should be able to clear the backlog within the two days left for the exercise if it sends more materials to the registration centres
2679187 the interior ministry should focus its constitutional duty of ensuring peace and security in the country it should ensure personnel of the ghana police service stay neutral and operate within the confines of the law
2679188 your presence at the function assures me of your love and support without which i would not be able to achieve the objectives set for the progress of the people i would continue to count on you as partners in the years ahead
2679189 it is very distressing to read and hear various rejoinders on the issue in the print and electronic media
2679190 the rewards that come in their wake are immense very motivating and would reduce unemployment among the youth
2679191 dark magic extra bold exudes spellbinding complexity crafted for sweet and intense espresso excellent as a drip coffee too get 24 k cups per box
2679192 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2679193 maybe thats why it hurts so much it hit so close

2679196 a part of you has grown in me and so you see its you and me together forever and never apart maybe in distance but never in heart
2679197 a part of you has grown in me and so you see its you and me together forever and never apart maybe in distance but never in heart
2679198 raise money and plan and execute sustainable engineering projects around the world
2679199 making movies as distinct from owning libraries of fully amortized films that continue to throw off sizeable profits has gone from a modestly profitable activity to one that now generates substantial losses over the initial release of films to all worldwide markets a period of roughly five years
2679200 we sit here stranded though were all doin our best to deny it
2679201 you can either go to the church of your choice or you can go to brooklyn state hospital youll find god in the church of your choice youll find woody guthrie in brooklyn state hospital and though its only my opinion i may be right or wrong youll find them both in the grand canyon at sundown
2679202 napoleon in rags and the sweet talk that he used

2679207 you know the difference between a fiddle and a violin a violin has strings on it a fiddle has strangs
2679208 how do you tell if a drummer is sitting level the drool comes out of both sides of his mouth
2679209 to federate inspire and promote great work in advertising and communication in favor of social responsibility and sustainable development and to show how advertising plays a significant role in raising awareness in todays crucial world issues
2679210 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2679211 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2679212 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2679213 maybe it will be quiet in the future im an optimist

2679215 der b hmische prater stirbt nicht nur wegen fehlender subventionen sondern auch aufgrund seiner unerreichbarkeit trotz stadtn he die jetzigen ffentlichen verkehrsanbindungen sind der reinsten hohn und lassen die g ste des b hmischen praters sicher nicht auf ihr fahrzeug verzichten

2679220 as some of you know ive got a short prose story appearing this month in the darker mask tor books 2008
2679221 publishers weekly describes the darker mask as themed along the grayer areas of superhero fiction this anthology of 18 original stories nonetheless covers a wide spectrum
2679222 that being said i am just happy to be part of the book and doubly so to have an excuse to see many of you that i havent seen in awhile
2679223 what a book signing for the darker mask featuring myself and a host for far more talented contributors including co editor gary phillips naomi hirahara steven barnes and tananarive due
2679224 hey gorgeous youre the girl my mother always warned me about want to show me why
2679225 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2679226 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2679227 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2679228 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2679229 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2679230 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2679231 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2679232 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2679233 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2679234 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2679235 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2679236 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2679237 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2679238 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2679239 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2679240 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2679241 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2679242 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2679243 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2679244 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2679245 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2679246 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2679247 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2679248 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2679249 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2679250 unfortunately its been cancelled which is a real shame because it was a cracking card
2679251 the course is waterlogged in places and there is nothing they can do about it we had a lot of rain it was a deluge yesterday and there have been more showers overnight

2679255 it was a deceptively simple question that lets us view our earths current myriad stresses from the disarming vantage of a fantasy in which we supposedly no longer exist yet somehow we get to watch what unfolds net watch and maybe learn
2679256 when you examine societies just as self confident as ours that unraveled and were eventually swallowed by the jungle you see that the balance between ecology and society is exquisitely delicate if something throws that off it can all end two thousand years later someone will be squinting over the fragments trying to find out what went wrong
2679257 imagine id give him anything he wanted and hes going to label food
2679258 there is nothing called mind to mind transmission at all in zen buddhism
2679259 if youre worried about high destination costs consider an all inclusive resort

2679261 i think the constitutional convention bill is going to have a pretty good chance of passing the house
2679262 when people get engaged they will get the kind of government they deserve and respect
2679263 the person who shot the ball chases it break the rules of the street
2679264 if we we were as good looking as them wed be famous
2679265 if we have that come to a screeching halt were out of the race
2679266 when you see the lack of cooperation in making development deals you as an individual think twice
2679267 i take a step back i wonder if this great project cant get done what can
2679268 it looks to me like its the unions fighting business
2679269 the level of economic activity in the state of michigan and lansing the metropolitan area in particular will continue to contract based upon what we are seeing in the engineering and architectural pipelines
2679270 i cannot recall a time when this leading indicator of future economic activity looked as bleak as it does right now
2679271 were trying to transform lansing and each piece is so important residential density new retail a new city market an expanded river trail these are all connected
2679272 were very much a part of the tradition of state government two political parties that battle it out until one wins
2679273 im sure that the mayors family is going to be very happy to have him back home
2679274 this was obviously very very stressful for them and i dont pretend to tell you what it is they are thinking at this time
2679275 i have been living in an incredible state of pressure and scrutiny for seven months during this time period
2679276 ive always been on time ive always listened to my attorneys in everything that we are doing
2679277 at that time customers who couldnt pay their utility bills would come into the utility office
2679278 they had maybe a 2 bill and would be told to work three days or so to pay off the amount owed
2679279 outstanding accomplishment in civic improvement and in recognition of vision and civic pride
2679280 the zoo began with ducks living along the stream that flows through the park and animals brought in for rehabilitation
2679281 most everything in there was built by public utilities employees
2679282 the frame for the shelter house was built in the power plant out of used boiler tubes
2679283 were also trying to expand the exhibit area for the zoo
2679284 weve been donated a tiger but need facilities for it
2679285 theres a monument south of the kiddie park engraved with the names of people who have donated to the park
2679286 i could have taken the wrong way but i got a bed to sleep in and beautiful meals to eat
2679287 it was something to help my family and give me something to do
2679288 i had dropped out of high school to find work to help my family but i didnt have any skills
2679289 it meant that the ccc helped support lumberyards and hardware stores and grocers and farmers
2679290 its been estimated that the ccc advanced forestry practices in the united states by 10 years
2679291 there had been a lot of logging in connecticut in the 1800s cutting the trees for things like the charcoal industry said marty podskoch who wrote the book
2679292 they just left the debris of that logging by the railroad lines and the sparks from the trains would set off a lot of forest fires
2679293 so some teenagers went to camps they got good meals and were fattened up then they could join the ccc
2679294 there was a commanding officer who gave you your orders each day and you went out and did them
2679295 as many as 20 percent of the recruits in the ccc were illiterate or only had a third grade education
2679296 in the camps they learned to read and write they could get the equivalent of a high school education and it was a great boon for them
2679297 i was eating my meal that night and i got the order to report to the infirmary
2679298 i came from a family with five children and no one thought of going to college
2679299 the ccc made it a lot easier to understand how to get along in the army
2679300 they didnt join the ccc to be part of the greatest conservation effort in u s history
2679301 they joined because they were hungry but they came out with a great sense of community they came out different
2679302 they should have it today instead of spending money on the things theyre spending it on
2679303 whats the use of making beautiful images when the world is falling apart
2679304 there is a deeper thing to express the return of humanity to some sort of balanced awareness of the natural things some rocks and sky we need a little earth to stand on and feel run through our fingers perhaps photography can do this
2679305 me having been on the other side of the rivalry seeing all the past outfielders tonight having barry come out the energy seemed to be up the energy in this game tonight was like the energy i remember as a dodger playing against the giants
2679306 anytime you get an opportunity to have a walk off game winning hit those are some of the most exciting moments in your career
2679307 thats stuff you dont forget almost every player remembers all his walk off hits this one was special with the dodgers being here in front of all of our fans
2679308 that was a big win for us we havent had too many come from behind wins like that at home hopefully we can build on that tomorrow
2679309 for one they see the connection between the environment and public health and alternative fuels
2679310 theyre also starting to see the benefit of using domestically produced fuel rather than imported fuel because our lives are so interconnected with transportation
2679311 i take this with sincerity were in a real crisis and i think we need to look at alternative means
2679312 theres not too many places for people to turn and this is a relatively straightforward and affordable way to go
2679313 ive always been concerned about the environment and yeah it seemed like a fun thing to do
2679314 one of many solutions that we need to come up with to gain independence from petroleum
2679315 zu aktuellen und potenziellen investoren u ern wir uns grunds tzlich nicht wenn sie unter der meldeschwelle liegen
2679316 theyre happening in commuter parking lots where they can slip in in the middle of night or even the daytime and steal them pretty quickly
2679317 until these precious metals went up so high you hardly ever got one
2679318 are making us the bad guy to make it seem we are buying stolen materials
2679319 we are not the bad guy here but they are putting the onus on us
2679320 it feels odd for me not to be in uniform and the dodgers are right there you heard me torre to which the dodger manager doffed his cap i beat you before and ill beat you again i havent retired
2679321 man what has happened we are in an upscale restaurant in the middle of hong kong my god how bad could it be in other places
2679322 take it home repaint it and put it on the wall
2679323 if you have too much stuff they think its small
2679324 i worked at hollister its kind of like abercrombie amp fitch its in every mall almost i actually worked at the eaton centre
2679325 i actually put myself on tape and i auditioned for it that way i sent the tape down to l a and the casting director saw it and then showed it to the producers
2679326 those specific producers film a lot in salt lake city specifically its a great place its kind of small so it was very peaceful and a really great working environment
2679327 believe it or not we used a fully functioning mall
2679328 another really cool aspect was that if you had a scene or two off you could walk around the mall and go shopping and we did we spent a lot of our money
2679329 id never had professional experience i did go to a performing arts high school but its definitely new to me and im so happy to be part of this new sort of musical boom
2679330 im a musical fan i love rent and chicago chicago especially theres one dance in our movie thats kind of like cell block tango its very similar it was sort of my inspiration for that number
2679331 were currently filming season eight just like every year its getting better and better my characters more prominent this year and theyre developing her storyline
2679332 im living in my wildest dream please dont wake me up
2679333 the suns going down on the midway tonight the race tracks are turning to gray but emmets still out in the big top tonight just a sweeping the spotlight away
2679334 damas itu punya fungsi sunda itu punya filosofi sayang yah kalau gerakannya yang sekarang dan kemampuan sdm nya cuma segitu doank
2679335 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2679336 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2679337 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2679338 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2679339 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2679340 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2679341 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2679342 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2679343 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit
2679344 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2679345 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
2679346 the government is committed to a more disciplined approach to managing spending
2679347 certainly we felt some of the groups were not necessarily ones we thought canadians would agree were the best choices to be representing them internationally
2679348 i dont even want to say it their name on the phone
2679349 some of the groups we felt had little to do with our foreign policy or how canadians would want us to be perceived abroad
2679350 abolishing this program is the equivalent of killing the entire culture market abroad
2679351 these all seem to indicate concerns that are based in personal taste and conservative ideology rather than in how to best reflect the diversity of culture in canada and how best to represent canadian cultural expression
2679352 it really does seem to play to the most right wing part of the conservative party
2679353 we are still supporting arts funding including international arts promotion
2679354 whilst im being honest enough to admit that it didnt live up to my expectations from the hysterical trailer im going all out to say that its a nice little honest and from the heart sports comedy that will give you a good time thanks to bernie macs winsome lead performance but wont even attempt to offer you up anything new or original in terms of the genre it represents
2679355 i think its kind of sad that theyre thinking about that instead of their country
2679356 we have no control over how they pick the team and who the manager is our job is to play baseball not worry about whos managing
2679357 its a pity that people think about that instead of what they should do on the field
2679358 both are the same age i think what billingsley is doing this year is a lot of what matts been doing the last few starts

2679378 consumers may be cutting back in terms of discretionary spending but they are not about to send their kids to school without the necessities
2679379 consumers are clearly shifting to value and one stop shop channels as they seek to optimize shopping trips
2679380 retailers at risk this back to school season are the specialty retailers such as office supply stores where distinct trips are needed and apparel retailers which are heavily skewed to discretionary spending
2679381 consumers recognize that retail prices tend to fall the closer we get to the first day of school

2679462 now a mediator is not a mediator of one but god is one
2679463 my covenant they broke although i was an husband to them saith the lord
2679464 i make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through jesus christ
2679465 and in that day will i make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of the heavens and with the creeping things of the ground and i will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth and will make them to lie down safely
2679466 this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel
2679467 thus said the lord god behold i will take the children of israel from among the nations to which they are gone and will gather them on every side and bring them into their own land
2679468 and all israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob for this is my covenant unto them that i will take away their sins
2679469 alas for the day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of jacobs trouble great tribulation but he shall be saved out of it but they shall serve the lord and david their king whom i shall raise up unto them
2679470 and david my servant shall be king over them and they shall have one shepherd they shall also walk in mine ordinances and observe my statutes and do them and they shall dwell in the land that i have given unto jacob my servant and they shall dwell in it even they and their children and their childrens children forever and my servant david shall be their prince forever moreover i will make a covenant of peace with them it shall be an everlasting covenant with them
2679471 for i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more
2679472 a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you an heart of flesh
2679473 i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts
2679474 and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my ordinances and do them
2679475 behold i will gather them out of all countries to which i have driven them yea i will rejoice over them in doing them good and i will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul
2679476 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is
2679477 but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant
2679478 for finding fault with this he saith behold the days come saith the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and the house of judah
2679479 not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they broke
2679480 in that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old now that which decayeth and groweth old is ready to vanish away
2679481 he hath made the first old nigh unto vanishing away
2679482 and this is the covenant from me unto them these hebrew believers were called then to face the fact that the old covenant with the law principle of blessing had been set aside we behold national israel today without a covenant and so we turn to hebrews 13 20 and covenant
2679483 having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh
2679484 likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood this do in remembrance of me
2679485 who also hath made us able ministers of the new covenant not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life
2679486 but now we are delivered from the law israels new covenant writes the kingdom law upon their hearts having died to that in which we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the mosaic letter
2679487 this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church
2679488 the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men
2679489 the mystery which was kept secret since the world began
2679490 even the mystery which hath been hidden from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints
2679491 according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world
2679492 who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ before the world began
2679493 but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the ages unto our glory which none of the princes of this age knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory
2679494 in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of was not forgiven rather on the cross it was judged condemned and crucified
2679495 god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin in the flesh
2679496 knowing this that out old adamic man was crucified with him
2679497 for he hath made him who knew no sin to be sin for us
2679498 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creation old first adam things are positionally passed away behold all things are become positionally new
2679499 likewise reckon ye also yourselves to have died indeed unto sin but to be alive unto god in jesus christ
2679500 even when we were dead in sins god hath made us alive recreated together with christ and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus
2679501 boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus
2679502 and when the day of pentecost was fully come suddenly there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind and they were all filled with the holy spirit
2679503 for by one spirit were we all baptized into one body
2679504 so we being many are one body in christ and every one members one of another
2679505 for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ
2679506 at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye in me and i in you
2679507 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god
2679508 the spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god
2679509 and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ
2679510 for he that is joined to the lord is one spirit
2679511 for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones
2679512 when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is
2679513 for our citizenship is in heaven from where also we look for the saviour the lord jesus christ who shall change our lowly body that it may be fashioned like his glorious body
2679514 when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory
2679515 they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years
2679516 which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come
2679517 a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish
2679518 according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness
2679519 it pleased the father to reveal his son in me
2679520 to be a prince and a saviour to give repentance to israel and remission of sin
2679521 the spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together
2679522 that we are predestinated to the adoption of children by jesus christ
2679523 its going to be hard to figure out what to do without them

2679548 we do understand that there are security concerns in some of the states circles where spectrum cannot be allocated but wherever it is available there should not be any delay as the government had earlier announced in january this year that enough spectrum is available in most of the circles to accommodate all the new players as well to meet the needs of the existing operators

2679656 if all is well we should still have time even if theres a playoff for a three hole aggregate score playoff if need be
2679657 i think that every one of us can play 36 holes
2679658 obviously the guys that finished today that played well will have a nice relaxing morning while were out there grinding its going to be tough for us but it can be done
2679659 it may be exhausting to play 36 holes youre putting that much mental effort and everything into it
2679660 but one of those things where if you can play as much golf as you can and youre gone a good roll its fun to play
2679661 that to me is the most curious thing about this delay is the amount of moisture thats soaked up

2679671 amp by the way im going to try calling in 45 minutes the chances of you even answering when it rings are slim to none im sure prove me wrong
2679672 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2679673 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2679674 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2679675 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2679676 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2679677 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2679678 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2679679 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2679704 the subprime market caught a lot of military families in a real lurch just like any family
2679705 when a husband or wife is deployed theres less income and less financial help available
2679706 many enlisted folks are straight out of high school and theres no financial literacy training
2679707 all of a sudden they get a paycheck every two weeks but at the same time theyre underpaid as a result they go to payday loan stores to fill the gap and get into deeper and deeper debt
2679708 everyone in military service needs to be vigilant on what kind of financial transaction theyre getting into
2679709 the question youre really asking with a name is what is the brands true essence the heart and soul that youre trying to communicate to your audience
2679710 said george glatcz president of vox medica inc a philadelphia marketing and communications company focused on the health care industry
2679711 the drug that changed the game was eli lilly amp co s prozac if you remember there was a book out called prozac nation

2679713 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2679714 health chiefs are recommending all under 18s have the jab if they havent already but i think its all about keeping the drug companies happy they say they are addressing the measles epidemic sic but what are they doing about the autism epidemic

2679729 i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind senator obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2679730 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2679731 you could argue that nobodys every qualified to be president
2679732 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
2679733 we will work with canada and mexico to amend the north american free trade agreement so that it works better for all three north american countries
2679734 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 per cent of the tree

2679736 lenders are not as patient as they once were to do a restructuring

2679747 given current attrition rates the expected head count efficiencies could be achieved without significant layoffs
2679748 ultimately there will be positions that will not exist anymore
2679749 as lines of business grow there will be new opportunities
2679750 doing widespread layoffs is not who we are and its not how we do business
2679751 business owners are asking for more sophisticated analysis of their medical costs
2679752 to do that we need new equipment and we need to change staffing
2679753 if there is differences in pay scales based on differences on costs of living some of these factors have to be looked at
2679754 thats normal for any companies coming together but were not there yet
2679755 did you know that one of our mutual funds just changed managers

2679758 information technology equipment radio disturbance characteristics limits and methods of measurement
2679759 it is most disappointing that we have another postponement and frustrating for the bacar team who have all the equipment ready to fly
2679760 the chinese authorities refused to issue visas to ten of our members but this has not stopped us from making ourselves heard in beijing by means of a clandestine radio broadcast using miniaturised fm transmitters and antennas
2679761 reporters without borders devised and carried out this protest in a spirit of resistance against state control of the media
2679762 this is the first non state radio station to have broadcast in china since the communist party took power in 1949 only international chinese language radio stations broadcasting on shortwave would be able to break this news and information monopoly but they are jammed by the authorities
2679763 gesture of defiance towards the chinese authorities who are still keeping dozens and dozens of journalists and internet users in prison
2679764 despite everything there are people who are going to be able to speak out about things you dont want the public to hear in the very heart of beijing regardless of the measures you take you will not get rid of free speech
2679765 you banned us from going to beijing you expelled us from china but despite all that we are here making our voice heard peacefully in a completely non violent fashion it is a way of saying censorship just wont work
2679766 we can help alleviate shortages by drilling for oil and gas in our own country we have got the opportunity to find more crude oil here at home
2679767 as a nation we can have more control over our energy destiny by supplying more of the oil and natural gas well be consuming from resources here at home
2679768 it doesnt look good to say we need more oil but then export the refined products that youre getting it doesnt seem to be consistent

2679776 as a team there is nothing more important to us than supporting mrs bachman in her struggle and supporting hugh and elisabeth in their grief
2679777 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through we have been in touch with hugh throughout this tragedy and we are extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying
2679778 they know we are here for them in every way possible we are binding together as a team to lift the bachman and mccutcheon families we are a family and we will get through this together as a family
2679779 the boys have done a good job in dealing with it its on the forefront of their minds but they are ready to play
2679780 hugh is attending to wizz elisabeth and mrs bachman right now he does not know when or if he will be able to return to the team the team has rallied behind him to support whatever decision he decides to make

2679786 no matter whats gone on between us i had to share that with you im going to email you the pictures
2679787 here was a group of men in truly dire straits a hard winter bad food cramped conditions anger boredom depression and lots of fear because the year previous half the men at st croix had died of scurvy so they were waiting for the first signs of disease but instead of wallowing in depression and fear or cracking the whip of discipline champlain decided to throw a gigantic party
2679788 its location as the farthest western port is the logical conclusion of champlains dream that is his exploration succeeded all the way to the west coast and here they are four centuries later smack up against another ocean
2679789 i think this series continues to give a realistic picture of what its like to be a canadian woman of a certain age and outlook
2679790 when i began the series i felt middle aged women were not well represented in popular culture sadly i believe this is still the case joanne was 46 when the series began and shes 57 now at any rate after 18 years i think this series continues to give a realistic picture of what its like to be a canadian woman of a certain age and outlook
2679791 i wanted to continue writing after 1919 but my writing partner found the critical process unbearable
2679792 when ron decided he didnt want to write anymore i started a mystery mostly because mysteries had been my pleasure reading in graduate school
2679793 ive been married to the same amazing man for 40 years i couldnt have done half of what ive done without him ted is constantly supportive not just by encouraging me but also by taking over so many of the tasks that having a family involves
2679794 we have three grown children and four grandchildren at the risk of tripping over a cliche they are the lights of our lives they all live in regina and i count my blessings every day
2679795 we have always treated my writing as a family business growing up our kids did a lot of the housework dog walking lawn mowing and when the cheques arrived we paid for the two who wanted to go to private school for all of them to go to university and for all of us to travel to texas or chicago or the black hills toronto or wherever
2679796 mystery novels like mythological thought and greek poetry brings to the centre of a fictional narrative the most intense and fundamental of questions of the human being death and sexuality
2679797 he is a public employee a middle aged person and a solitary man he has a critical mind and a romantic heart above all he is an ethical man
2679798 setting fictional loose among the ghosts of history is a dicey matter

2679801 my father and i followed the 12 questions and we built our succession plan together
2679802 the experience brought us closer together and we did what so many family businesses find difficult to do we sold our business we protected our wealth and grew our relationship over the 20 years that i have been in business i have watched families struggle to find peace in their family businesses i knew that the 12 questions that guided our family when shared in a book could help millions of family business around the world manage their emotions manage their relationships and protect their wealth
2679803 i wanted to remind family business owners that the average lifespan of a business is about 30 years that businesses change that consumer demand for a companys products and services changes and that selling a family business is okay that selling a family business should be the goal the book shows business owners that their wealth can be used to educate their children or grandchildren or support charitable causes all valid and powerful legacies in their own right
2679804 in the absence of a clearly defined business succession plan this is the precise moment that wealth and families will destroy themselves
2679805 when business owners fail to plan everyone pays a steep price when a business fails employees suppliers customers and of course the family itself
2679806 man just cause its a theme song dont make it not true

2679833 a lot of people when they think of a kayak they think of something that flips over
2679834 that is a whitewater kayak open water kayaking is more stable than canoeing because your center of gravity is lower your butt is essentially below the surface of the water
2679835 we have two canoes and probably 40 kayaks in the store with kayaks being more stable and easier to move forward it doesnt take as much strength to move the boat forward because youre not trying to part as much water
2679836 we knew that every day that went by someone was at risk of dying this fire was just a question of time the building has been wide open for many months with mentally ill people and men and women addicted to drugs camping there in the most horrible squalor imaginable
2679837 can pull from the ashes of this situation a solution that will untie the red tape that prevented them from securing or condemning this abandoned building months ago hopefully they are successful at preventing future loss of life and property

2679842 because of low prices for soybeans those acres had reduced over time
2679843 now people are looking to plant acres that hadnt been planted in several years
2679844 if the market stays at 13 theres still money to be made in the crop
2679845 everybodys biggest concern is if rice soybeans and wheat go back to the levels where they were two years ago
2679846 if production costs stay where they are theyll be no profit
2679847 we have already informed turkeys ministry of foreign affairs on the possible evacuation of the filipinos if the situation worsens
2679848 i think it was a problem when i did my thesis and its obviously still a problem now
2679849 when i did my thesis i never set out to prove there were a lot of people doing it i was more interested in the mindset of an athlete who does steroids
2679850 i knew i was going to get numbers but i didnt think i would get as many people to admit to it i was surprised because it was far more than i thought but each time something like this has come up its pretty consistent i think for a while people have underestimated how widespread this is
2679851 it really surprised me that we had that much of a problem in st landry parish with illegal steroid use
2679852 im really surprised that its that big now that were fully into the investigation were certainly gathering some good intelligence and identifying more users
2679853 we are still in the identification process steroid abuse among high school athletes concerns me as a sheriff if we do have a problem with high school athletes were certainly going to bring it to a head
2679854 when i spoke in front of the texas senate committee hearings i knew what was going on because i have a good feel for whats going on in high school
2679855 i knew at least 15 20 guys that were using i threw out statistics that astonished senate members
2679856 when they voted to implement mandatory steroid testing in texas high schools last school year it was almost unanimous
2679857 youd see guys taking steroids in the locker room and it was administered by trainers it was done out in the open but youve gotta remember it was different back then there was no steroid testing back then
2679858 when you start to think about it there are three professional teams in houston none of them have been busted there are several colleges and universities none of them have been busted
2679859 you want to get bigger stronger faster you take steroids you cant lie to kids and say it wont help you they see the results
2679860 i wish we could test for it the education is one thing but those kids dont see down the road they dont see the negative things theyre just thinking about right now
2679861 i think if you are going to do it you have to do it right its going to take a lot of money to get everybody to do it its going to be hard
2679862 i think the place you start is education at a young age
2679863 you provide them education about all the problems the testing sounds good on paper but were still seeing an increase in use theyre very well aware of all the ins and outs of testing theyre not all that random its not enough to say we test
2679864 they had the same personalities you could see the boyish looks in their eyes youd look at them for a while and the flash would come back the way they used to look
2679865 when we got in the middle of the floor and sang our class song it was rewarding and touching
2679866 its the need for being connected to people closeness belonging to groups it represents feeling like were part of a special group
2679867 when were able to tap into the feeling that we belong to a certain group its very satisfying
2679868 its an opportunity for people to highlight accomplishments and it could be an opportunity to revel or relive the years associated with accomplishments like athletic endeavors student council or popularity
2679869 it was a time when you were more free to have fun
2679870 you didnt have the same stressors that go along with adulthood like raising children working with your career juggling the demands that go along with family although there were other stressors
2679871 some of our experiences are more negative and we would rather not be reminded of them feeling left out teasing not fitting in
2679872 most people have gained 10 15 or 20 pounds with the natural progression of age some tend to have wrinkles and that may contribute to their feelings of self consciousness they may be worrying will i still have anything in common with these people
2679873 either consciously or unconsciously were looking at all the variables and making a decision about whether we currently have unmet needs that might be met at this reunion and whether the risks outweigh them
2679874 if theyre going through a tough time they wont be able to highlight how great their lives are but it may be a great time to go because they might get a great deal of support and find others who are having similar troubles in life they may connect with others and leave with a sense of being fulfilled
2679875 for the 10 year there were not a lot of people

2679881 these lights are too bright i dont see how you expect anyone to sleep in here
2679882 the emergency room was too much stimulation for them with emergencies coming in their stress level goes out the roof
2679883 were taking patients into an environment more therapeutic to meet their needs its calm quiet and structured
2679884 they start to know that they can get the help that they need here
2679885 for two years maybe 2 1 2 years after the storms the only cry that we heard at this office was we need more beds
2679886 having this front end has helped sort out who needs an acute bed versus who can be served in some other method that is less restrictive and less costly we dont have to have as many people looking for beds as before
2679887 their symptoms appear to be less aggravated and less acute in the unit
2679888 still in all because we have an environment conducive to calmness and structure that has the staff to accomodate their needs even if they end up going to an inpatient psych facility theyre a lot calmer before they get there their therapy has actually started here instead of waiting 12 hours
2679889 we expected people in mental crisis because of what happened to them but for a long time our state had a problem with people presenting to emergency rooms with behavioral health issues
2679890 we didnt have a strong continuum of care for patients with this type of need the emergency room was the place they ended up when they were in crisis
2679891 in addition to compromising our ability to deliver emergency care to the traditional patient presenting to the ed for a medical surgical emergency the addition of psychiatric patients to the acute ed environment limited our ability to effectively care for either group in the safest most therapeutic environment
2679892 as an extension area of the acute ed mhere staff are dedicated to working with public and private psychiatric agencies around the state to refer and place these patients in the best care setting as expeditiously as possible the time to appropriate setting has been improved with better patient outcomes the ultimate goal
2679893 it has definitely decreased the amount of bottlenecking that has occurred in the emergency room
2679894 when i got back to the emergency room with one intern and started seeing emergency psych patients of the 23 beds in the emergency room one particular day 18 of those were filled with behavioral health emergency patients
2679895 this has markedly improved that we dont have an overflow in the emergency room therefore the emergency room can do their job too
2679896 every time the bus leaves this property to a group to church on an outing etc make sure if you have the opportunity you are on it

2679899 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2679900 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2679901 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2679902 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2679903 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2679904 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2679905 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2679906 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2679907 women are like tea bags they dont know how strong they are until they get into hot water
2679908 i personally believe that u s americans are unable to locate the us on a map because uh some people out there in our nation dont have maps
2679909 attacks by seperatists claimed the lives of at least ten georgian soldiers
2679910 despite our call for peace and a unilateral ceasefire separatists continued the shelling of georgian villages
2679911 whoever has the biggest tribe wins the war thats just the way it is and always will be
2679912 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2679913 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2679914 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2679915 maybe it will be quiet in the future im an optimist
2679916 the very purpose of these attacks is all about separating the region from china
2679917 want to use the olympic stage to enlarge the impact
2679918 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2679919 i heard some bombs and then i heard some machine guns
2679920 we came down to the lobby this morning and it was breakfast as usual
2679921 weve all heard that there was a bombing early this morning
2679922 this doesnt usually happen its happening now because of the olympics but i dont know who is doing it
2679923 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale
2679924 no state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state
2679925 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe
2679926 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshipping here in beijing china
2679927 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2679928 once again i had a very uplifting experience going to a church
2679929 it was a spirit filled feeling as you know i feel very strongly about religion and im so appreciative of the chance to go to church here
2679930 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2679931 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2679932 i know you came here from the swimming center and would like to offer you my congratulations on the excellent performance of mr phelps
2679933 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2679934 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2679935 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2679936 we are only taking actions against the breakaway milf group that defied the orders of the ceasefire panels
2679937 we dont know what will happen next but this will certainly have an adverse impact on peace talks
2679938 the current situation on the ground is very fluid and very volatile
2679939 theres so much uncertainty and the worsening situation on the ground could threaten the entire peace process
2679940 we have given up our secessionist position and were very committed to the peace process
2679941 peacekeepers posts monitor the presence of georgian forces artillery and armour
2679942 we do not have a lot of details now and are checking the reports saying more than 12 civilians were killed and 18 more wounded
2679943 theyll remain deadlocked and each side will use it to become more deeply entrenched in their positions
2679944 and youre also seeing a lot of health issues from kids not building a fort out back or playing on the stoop and their neighborhood
2679945 i think its responding to a number of anxieties out there
2679946 the next generation is the one thats going to make or break us as a planet
2679947 not one person ive ever talked to doesnt think this is a good idea
2679948 this is really a product of thousands of educators pushing congress to get at it
2679949 youre sitting at a desk in rows youre engaging a couple of your senses if you go outside you engage all your senses
2679950 its so important to look at the education of the child in terms of the environment
2679951 weve got this growing crisis on our hands where weve got these kids magnetized to the computer
2679952 this idea is really catching fire all over the country we want our parks to be not just parks but learning laboratories for kids
2679953 kids are lacking the time outside kids come to summer camp and they get a little free time outside to play and they dont know how to do it anymore

2679976 64 bit operating systems are becoming more mainstream and finally enable user memory to shed the 2gb limitation of 32 bit os
2679977 moreover the latest multi core systems are capable of simultaneous execution of highly complex workloads each commanding its own virtual memory space in that scenario the only way of avoiding data collision without writing back to the hard disk is the migration towards super high memory densities
2679978 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
2679979 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
2679980 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
2679981 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
2679982 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

2679993 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
2679994 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
