2780000 we will go back to the world as it was the day before cox testified that the emergency order was coming
2780001 our strategies remained pretty much the same what did change however was the level of compliance involved before making trades
2780002 before we can make a trade that involves short stock in those affected names we have to verify that the customer has pre borrowed the stock and then get confirmation from the firm that lent the stock this slows us down and eats up quite a bit of manpower that can be better used elsewhere

2780042 it certainly gained a great deal of attention we did this on a friday morning and by friday afternoon i had already received three messages from people interested in the car
2780043 horizontal marketing is easier and cheaper than just about any other form of marketing
2780044 in the case of horizontal marketing a competitor might be someone who overlaps with you but doesnt duplicate your offering exactly
2780045 both of you benefit by being able to offer a wider range of services and by pleasing clients who might otherwise have felt a need to go elsewhere
2780046 if youre a small company without much brand identity you can ride the coattails of a stronger brand by offering them some type of promotion for their customers whether that be a product coupon etc
2780047 for example lets say you own the local miniature golf park offer the big movie theater in your neighborhood a ton of buy one get one free tickets its a free gift for the movie theater credibility for you and access to all the teenagers looking for a fun place to take their dates
2780048 working with the gym has worked out very very well because the type of people who work out are people who care about their health and wellness which is exactly the type of customers we like and who like us
2780049 for example say youre a bookstore owner located in a strip center along with a childrens clothing store and a discount linens store
2780050 each vendor increased sales by 20 percent or more reduced their advertising and mailing costs and expanded their client base eight fold

2780053 i wanted to thank all of you who contributed to mitt romney you cant realize how much leverage this gives huron going forward to ask various people for business
2780054 thank you for helping bribe a politician wholl steer taxpayer money our way if he gets into office
2780055 you want to bring something disruptive and different by looking forward to where trends and consumers are going
2780056 but you also have retailers and other parties who are focused on tomorrow and not a year from now its definitely a balancing act
2780057 we came into the meeting with a couple of tubes

2780060 i dont care if its a white cat or a black cat its a good cat so long as it catches mice
2780061 ive been fighting loving breathing the chinese i couldnt see myself anywhere else in the world
2780062 when i started in the chinese market others told me we need to do research to see what people are looking for
2780063 theres no way to research what people are looking for i had to think from my experience in america and ask what can people in china use i believed they could use my product
2780064 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2780065 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2780066 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2780067 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2780068 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2780069 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2780070 although the chinese have been capable of disrupting groups operating inside the country these new attackers are trained and equipped outside and come into china to carry out operations this is a new capability that chinese security forces have to deal with and they are finding it difficult
2780071 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2780072 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2780073 this is just unreal im sorry for the pastor and his family

2780088 most of the students i encountered had already embraced the perspectives of the rich the powerful and the unalienated and they seemed to have done so with appalling ease in keeping with the tradition of the american rich they worked exceptionally long hours they were aggressive in exercising their talents and on the ideological features of market capitalism they were unanimous their written work disclosed the core components of the consensus upheld by their liberal parents the meaning of liberty lies in the personal choice of consumers free competition in goods and morals regulates value technological progress is an unmixed good war is unfortunate

2780092 this isnt the first time this has happened and it doesnt surprise me anymore
2780093 politics takes precedence over sport with the iranians and the olympic spirit is as far from them as east is far from west
2780094 my heart goes out to the iranian athletes in the athens olympics one of their sportsmen who was a gold medal favorite had to pull out because he was drawn against an israeli

2780115 i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
2780116 it was our first game we were very anxious we missed shots that we normally would hit but at the end of the day you win by almost 30 points youve got to take good things out of that
2780117 we played very very hard we give ourselves a chance defensively every night thats what its all about with us
2780118 we came out a little tight we knew that it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams especially china playing in front of their home crowd
2780119 we withstood the storm we calmed down and we just played a lot better basketball
2780120 maybe this was our biggest mistake that we think on the floor that this can be continued you know

2780151 young people are thinking its acceptable fashionable necessary for them to protect themselves to carry a knife
2780152 but just like we made guns unacceptable we should make knives unacceptable
2780153 you need not just young people but parents and other people to say that knives in britain like guns like bullying like racism all these things are unacceptable
2780154 people in the community have got to in a sense rise up and say this is unacceptable behaviour
2780155 i dont think the british people have ever been broken by anything or anyone

2780167 has nothing to do with the preparation of the games
2780168 its very sad whats going on in the world and we share the concern of the ioc but i would refer to the politicians for that
2780169 but personally i do believe that the olympics is something that can make things happen and im sure the olympic values and olympic ideals will be considered
2780170 it is a national problem and the ioc is not supposed to comment on situations like this we just hope that its going to be solved fast and it seems they made progress today we hope for the best
2780171 this is a wonderful opportunity for two organizing committees who have the same common interests to celebrate a little bit the time we have together in beijing
2780172 this is about our friendship our partnership our willingness to work together for the good of the olympic movement
2780173 they in my opinion are not late but they do not have one single day to lose or to waste

2780186 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
2780187 there is an enormous amount to learn about the in intricacies related to this industry ranging from garment construction and manufacture to printing packaging and logistics the industry is in peril for a darn good reason it took us quite a few passes until we settled on our current cmt fabric supplier and silkscreen printer there is a terrible lethargy that underlies the industry and make no mistake sharks patrol these waters
2780188 basically it breaks all the rules in an industry that believes in tried and tested models and is often not really interested in making a change it took us a while to find the right partners who would share our vision we have taken a slightly different angle of absolute empowerment from the microscopic to the macroscopic level on the microscopic side we have our service and content providers the cmt printers fabric manufacturers and the artists themselves on the macroscopic level the most publicly visible level we have pand vendors our dilemma was how do we empower everyone right through from the grassroots level

2780199 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2780200 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2780201 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2780202 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2780203 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2780204 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th

2780221 die stufen der maya waren bis zu 50 zentimeter hoch das hei t die maya hatten damals eine sehr gute kondition noch heute rennen die indios diese treppen hoch im gegensatz zu den touristen die sich keuchend hochschleppen
2780222 die treppe ist ein guter arzt mir hat sie gesagt h r mit dem rauchen auf

2780224 die treppe wird mehr und mehr durch lifte und laufb nder ersetzt das f hrt zu einer flacheren welt auch im geistigen sinn

2780231 yeah everyone sort of knows but like what are we going to do
2780232 its something within and were just not getting this from some of these guys
2780233 we have some guys who are making plays we have some guys who are playing very hard but to have the discipline to be able to do it on a consistent basis requires a tremendous commitment
2780234 i dont know what the issues are i dont know why were not getting it from some guys all i know is what i see and like i said i try to make the availability for some of these guys to come back and show me what youve got when we havent seen it theres not much choice other than to make a change
2780235 as an organization we need to continue to support the coaches and support our players
2780236 and maybe that will ultimately lead to my own demise but you know what so be it
2780237 this is a group that was one play away from winning the grey cup last year they deserve more than just a very quick shuffle out the door when things get tough because were all there to celebrate things and be on the bandwagon when things are good
2780238 are making us the bad guy to make it seem we are buying stolen materials
2780239 we are not the bad guy here but they are putting the onus on us
2780240 thefts of catalytic converters rising agencies say items stole for precious metals
2780241 the sustainability mirage illusion and reality in the coming war on climate change
2780242 this thoughtful and original study throws important critical light on the dominant orthodoxies about sustainable development and suggests a radically new direction foster argues compellingly that present approaches embody floating standards and bad faith trapping societies into inaction i suspect this is a seminal piece of work
2780243 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
2780244 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2780245 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
2780246 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
2780247 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2780248 body weight maintenance is made up of three basic stages
2780249 in the first stage the brain receives sensory input from the body including information provided by circulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin and from fuels such as glucose and fatty acids
2780250 it is well known that agrp agouti related protein neurons play a critical role in feeding and energy balance regulation
2780251 however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
2780252 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity
2780253 we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action
2780254 as these new findings demonstrate gaba release is an important component that mediates the function of agrp neurons
2780255 discoveries such as this will ultimately help us to design an efficient strategy to tackle the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease

2780257 when youve got people that are 30 year plus incumbents its smarter to sit on the fence than pick a horse that doesnt win
2780258 the big problem with don is that he used the money he was given for legal fees thats not why people contributed to him so that created incredible uproar amongst the money group
2780259 if you support the lieutenant governor the governor comes with that support so thats one thing but if the congressman ends up winning
2780260 neither of them are raising lots of money people are holding their powder
2780261 the club for growth is one of the most extreme groups in washington d c
2780262 this is a group that does not want to spend any money on alaskans period to me thats wrong a congressman must represent the people of alaska not some special interest group in washington d c
2780263 the large dollar donors are concerned about the potential vindictiveness of the congressman
2780264 im not opposed to earmarks im opposed to earmark abuse
2780265 and the abuse of the process where earmarks are dropped in without public scrutiny tarnishing alaskas reputation
2780266 thats primarily what don youngs war chest is made of is political action committees and gaming interests from puerto rico and louisiana and the like
2780267 sean i think is hopelessly na ve when it comes to the earmark process what a congressman or woman is supposed to do
2780268 or if hes not hopelessly na ve then hes simply pandering to this club for growth i mean a congressman is supposed to be working on ways to bring projects to this state
2780269 when your colleagues in the congress ask for an investigation of you things dont bode well for alaska
2780270 that means people are kind of distancing themselves people in congress and those are the folks that are going to be deciding alaskas fate
2780271 theres a little biblical saying you know judge not that ye be not judged yourself
2780272 i would absolutely bring projects to alaska that have been subject to public scrutiny and the light of day
2780273 i would think its going to be a close contest between young and parnell
2780274 ledoux is the wild card if she does well then the handicap has to go to young if she doesnt do well then parnell
2780275 don might still be able to pull this one off because of gabrielle ledoux which should make supporters of sean parnell pretty concerned because sean was the odds on favorite a few months ago

2780293 lo que nos estaban pidiendo es que la anot ramos por cualquier cosa para tener razones para desprestigiarla y argumentos para echarla del colegio
2780294 pero si ella es excelente alumna qu anotaciones vamos a poner si no tenemos razones
2780295 la anotan porque se demora en ir al ba o porque lidera tomas

2780303 i thought we could have won it sometimes you win sometimes you lose they came back they hit a great shot give them credit
2780304 if you consider this loss its not that important but its emotionally important it puts a lot of pressure on you in the next game and the following one so were going to have to play great and really step up
2780305 it was great we won the game we really feel good about that but there is still a long way to go
2780306 we cant get too rattled in the beginning with good streaks
2780307 if we get worried it wont help us we have to keep that in mind from here on out
2780308 everyone is proud it felt great all the flags and people cheering it was a great game great atmosphere
2780309 it was tough in the beginning but we managed to improve and get the win
2780310 we played very good defense and forced them to lose many balls that was the key to our victory it will help give us confidence
2780311 it was a great game a very important game for us
2780312 it was our defense and the running game those were the keys to the win
2780313 we missed a lot of free throws and we made some easy mistakes that made it easy for spain to control the game were going to try the next game not to give that present
2780314 it was a good start we had a little pressure on us but overall it went pretty well

2780405 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections

2780414 furthermore we condemn that practice accounted despicable and blameworthy by divine and human laws denounced by scripture in the old and new testaments namely the ferocious greed of usurers and we sever them from every comfort of the church

2780420 everyone thinks that if we automate the elections then all our problems will go away however if you look at the experience of the united states and other countries who have automated their elections the old problems still persist and new problems crop up

2780422 the anarchist is a person who is good at heart responsible
2780423 its good to destroy certain things because you build things to replace them
2780424 the anarchist movement was built by workers without work we cant talk about self management to put self management into practice we need to know how to do things to work its easy to be bohemian
2780425 my anarchist origins are rooted in my experience growing up in a poor family my father was leftist had gone to jail because he wanted the automony of the basque country for me thats not revolution im not nationalist with nationalism humanity has committed a lot of mistakes when my father got out of jail he became a socialist we suffered a lot i went to look for bread and the baker wouldnt give it to me because we didnt have money for me poverty enriched me i didnt have to make any effort to lose respect for the establishment the church private property and the state
2780426 when i met quico i was participating in the juventud libertarias they asked me if i could help sabate me an ignorant i didnt know who he was
2780427 i met guerillas that put me on the road to direct action and expropriations sabate taught me to lose respect for private property
2780428 this was the only means the anarchist had without funding from industry or government representatives to fund them the money was sent to those suffering from francos regime
2780429 passports for a refugee means being able to escape the country and lead safe lives elsewhere
2780430 whats helped me the most is my work anarchists were always workers
2780431 people like loise michel sabate durruti all the expropriators taught me how to expropriate but not for personal gain but how to use those riches for change
2780432 ive expropriated which according to the christian religion is a sin for me expropriations are necessary as the revolutionaries say robbing and expropriation is a revolutionary act as long as one doesnt benefit from it
2780433 ciao bella io sto lavorando e lo devo fare fino a ferraggosto tu ke stai a fa tutto apposto speriam ke non come penso ioooooo hemmmm passiamo ad unaltra domanda quando avrai una figlia come la chiamerai
2780434 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2780435 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2780436 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2780437 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2780438 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2780439 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2780440 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2780441 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2780442 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2780443 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here
2780444 i liked her much better in the bob i thought it was really sophisticated very chic and very trendy
2780445 this whole sort of fashion evolution since becoming mrs tom cruise i think it has taken her time to find her sea legs
2780446 this haircut is clearly a step in the right direction
2780447 im not sure that amy has the proper image that ben amp jerrys wants to be connected with
2780448 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit
2780449 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2780450 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
2780451 youre never told in our house shh levi is sleeping no get used to the ambiance come with us thats how i was raised
2780452 i liked her much better in the bob i thought it was really sophisticated very chic and very trendy
2780453 this whole sort of fashion evolution since becoming mrs tom cruise i think it has taken her time to find her sea legs
2780454 this haircut is clearly a step in the right direction
2780455 im not sure that amy has the proper image that ben amp jerrys wants to be connected with
2780456 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit
2780457 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2780458 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
2780459 back then things were selling quickly who knew we were going to come into a slump like this
2780460 if you get an offer in todays market youd better try to make the best of it and live with it if you can because there isnt another one waiting in the wings
2780461 probably half of the houses on the market are overpriced for what people are willing to pay for them
2780462 he priced it way too high from the get go
2780463 even though he was adjusting his price and coming down he was doing it too late and chasing the market down
2780464 the real estate agents wanted me to give my house away so they could make a sale thats how i looked at it
2780465 i wanted to make a sale too but at the right price not a giveaway
2780466 if youve gotten two or three offers at the same number thats where the market is
2780467 if it was worth 450 000 it would be selling for that
2780468 he picked everybodys brain and we were more than willing to give him advice if he would listen to it
2780469 they told me if you want to sell this house youve got to take the carpet up
2780470 youre paying agents for their advice and then youre disregarding that advice
2780471 if nobody else has snapped up this house in 12 months or longer whats going to make me want it
2780472 they want perfection in an old house and thats not going to happen
2780473 an older home at a start up price is not going to be modern like those home design shows
2780474 smart sellers are painting their walls that taupe y color and putting bowls around and taking other stuff out
2780475 get the old drain board off the kitchen counter and put out a bowl of oranges
2780476 a lot of sellers right now think buyers are being greedy
2780477 theyre afraid theyre going to buy a house and have its value decline after they move in theyre afraid theyre going to get stuck in that neighborhood
2780478 theyre not going to have the courage to buy that house unless its better than the other competition on the market and its irresistible to them
2780479 even in a good market fixer uppers attract only limited offers because people just dont have the time
2780480 and people who do have the time expect a really low price
2780481 if youre on a busy street you get a lot of attention from passers by
2780482 you cant make an old house a brand new house without a massive infusion of money
2780483 back then things were selling quickly who knew we were going to come into a slump like this
2780484 if you get an offer in todays market youd better try to make the best of it and live with it if you can because there isnt another one waiting in the wings
2780485 probably half of the houses on the market are overpriced for what people are willing to pay for them
2780486 he priced it way too high from the get go

2780489 i wanted to make a sale too but at the right price not a giveaway
2780490 if youve gotten two or three offers at the same number thats where the market is
2780491 we felt if they would vote for me they would vote for tracy
2780492 and if they would vote for tracy they would vote for kimbrough
2780493 i didnt solve 80 percent of my homicides when i was a detective by knowing priests
2780494 no state man or woman should fear the influence of a loving religion
2780495 you can feel the energy in this stadium said the banally ubiquitous matt lauer
2780496 then one foggy christmas day santa came to say liu chen with your nose so bright wont you guide my sleigh tonight
2780497 why am i withdrawing uh hands yes my hands hurt no you cant see them
2780498 military confrontation does not serve the interests of the local communities on the contrary it threatens the stability of the entire region
2780499 the aim for france and the european union is via dialogue with the parties involved to secure a ceasefire and then to contribute to a political solution to this conflict
2780500 fa is fastballs cu is cut fastball the rest are breaking pitches
2780501 so hitters counts are those in which the lwts are greater than 0 pitchers counts are those in which the lwts are less than 0
2780502 for this game if the hitter is in a hitters count he sees a fastball from daisuke without fail every time
2780503 platoon advantages exist and are significant and that the difference is larger for left handed hitters than for right handers the average left handed hitter hit 34 points better against right handers but that the difference from the mean spans a range from 12 to 45 points 34 plus and minus the standard deviation of 22 points for right handed hitters the mean value for batting average is 18 points with an average spread of between 1 and 35 points as you can see there is a fairly large amount of variability for hitters from both sides
2780504 the fastballs look almost straight to the right handed hitter and the breaking pitches have a noticeable hump however all the pitches appear to bend more sharply to the left handed hitter and the trajectories overlap more if all left handed pitchers repertoires look somewhat like this no wonder left handed batters have a harder time with them than right handed batters it makes me eager to apply this technique to other pitchers
2780505 what ive found in this study is that perhaps contrary to conventional wisdom it is primarily the fastball and slider that contribute to large platoon splits while the curveball and changeup are much more platoon neutral
2780506 you can imagine the true reason for the platoon split is simply the fact that the batter gets a better look at an opposite handed delivery this makes sense actually because the opposite side batter gets a bit more of a side view of the pitch which likely helps the perception of where the pitch is headed and its speed
2780507 additionally a study of sidearmers or more generally the variation of platoon split with arm angle would certainly shed additional light on the subject
2780508 what music will sound like in 2008 part 8 of 5
2780509 unique and precious days in history when individuals and nations return to god from apathy apostasy and idolatry
2780510 woe is me christmas is not going to be good this year because my circumstances are not ideal

2780512 my heart and my flesh sing for joy to the living god
2780513 the lord makes me happy all that i am rejoices in my god
2780514 the most amazing thing about this novel is that its based on fact
2780515 all descriptions of artwork architecture documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate
2780516 some say john the baptist some elijah and others jeremiah or one of the prophets
2780517 you are the christ the son of the living god
2780518 the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god
2780519 the u s constitutional framers understood that religious liberty can flourish only if the government leaves religion alone
2780520 whereas the senate of the united states devoutly recognizing the supreme authority and just government of almighty god in all the affairs of men and of nations has by a resolution requested the president to designate and set apart a day for national prayer and humiliation and whereas it is the duty of nations as well as of men to own their dependence upon the overruling power of god to confess their sins and transgressions in humble sorrow yet with assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon and to recognize the sublime truth announced in the holy scriptures and proven by all history that those nations only are blessed whose god is the lord
2780521 in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus for you
2780522 giving thanks always for all things to god the father in the name of our lord jesus christ
2780523 how we praise god the father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms because we belong to christ
2780524 oh give thanks to the lord for he is good for his mercy endures forever
2780525 oh taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man who trusts in him
2780526 all things work together for good to those who love god
2780527 17 for our present troubles are quite small and wont last very long yet they produce for us an immeasurably great glory that will last forever 18 so we dont look at the troubles we can see right now rather we look forward to what we have not yet seen for the troubles we see will soon be over but the joys to come will last forever
2780528 how do i know what gods will is for my life
2780529 give thanks in all circumstances for this is gods will
2780530 how can i be grateful when ive lost so much ive lost my job ive lost my health ive lost my husband or wife how can i be thankful in that situation
2780531 historical monotheism has a new companion and competitor personal spirituality
2780532 i believe in everything i was raised catholic but now im more buddhist but i dont practice anything specifically
2780533 one evening a son was talking to his father about current events
2780534 for those he foreknew he did predestine to become conformed to the image of his son
2780535 he was despised and rejected by men a man of sorrows and familiar with suffering like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows yet we considered him stricken by god smitten by him and afflicted but he was pierced for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities the punishment that brough us peace was upon him and by his wounds we are healed
2780536 weve run through many parts of the maze before and we can do it again
2780537 and im afraid im not interested in getting lost and making a fool of myself
2780538 sometimes hem things change and they are never the same again this looks like one of those times thats life life moves on and so should we

2780541 in the same way that you gave me a mission in the world i give them a mission in the world
2780542 for to me to live is christ and to die is gain
2780543 give yourselves to god surrender your whole being to him to be used for righteous purposes
2780544 so then my friends because of gods great mercy to us offer yourselves a living sacrifice to god dedicated to his service and pleasing to him this is the true worship you should offer
2780545 damaging stuff you might think except that according to the
2780546 because it refreshes our perception of who she is and refreshing perceptions is madonna s true art some years ago the american rock critic when you imagine madonna you dont see a single image but a time lapse photograph with one persona melting and warping into the next
2780547 i was mad for shooting a couple of years ago i loved my bespoke outfits and everything it was so much fun that all changed when a bird dropped in front of me that id shot it wasnt dead it got up and it was really suffering blood was gushing out of its mouth and it was struggling i havent shot since i realized i had a kind of bloodlust and was manically shooting things and trying to kill as many birds as possible

2780628 to love the pope it is sufficient to reflect who he is
2780629 and this is why when we love the pope we do not dispute whether he commands or requires a thing or seek to know where the strict obligation of obedience lies or in what matter we must obey when we love the pope we do not say that he has not yet spoken clearly as if he were required to speak his will in every mans ear and to utter it not only by word of mouth but in letters and other public documents as well nor do we cast doubt on his orders alleging the pretext which comes easily to the man who does not want to obey that it is not the pope who is commanding but some one in his entourage we do not limit the field in which he can and ought to exercise his authority we do not oppose to the popes authority that of other persons no matter how learned who differ from the pope for whatever may be their learning they are not holy for where there is holiness there cannot be disagreement with the pope
2780630 not one of my favorite bars this place makes me feel very cold inside you know that feeling where you are just not comfortable and everything seems sterile and lifeless sort of like i am in a fish tank literally like i am the fish swimming around get me out of here the service is somewhat flawed and the food can leave something to the imagination it also seems like the clientele is all underage we cruised here on the irving excursion and stopped here because we love karaoke i dont underdog was clean spacious and fair priced we drank danced sang and enjoyed ourselves i had no idea this place was a sports bar and grill and dont know if that part of it is any good i dont watch sports but there is a tuesday all night happy hour which has 2 beers and 1 tacos or vice versa i dont remember the 2 beers are select beers and i drank blue moon and peroni and they werent part of that list besides this taco tuesday thing they can set up beer pong they have plenty of ping seen them next time after a proper dinner i will challenge someone but last night i would have been drunk service is efficient and friendly people there are chill and keep to thier groups sometimes you also just meet people sitting around at the bar i remember thier buffalo wings are pretty good just the way i like it spicy like everyone else says its a clean place with really nice plasma screens every couple of feet underdog is probably the best bar in the sunset its so clean seriously ive never seen a bar in the sunset this clean before many many flat screen tv ive have never had a dull moment here before taco tuesdays are the best 1 tacos and 2 beers you cant beat it seriously underdogs looked awesome to watch some sunday night football with a daily happy hour til 7 and 50

2780639 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2780640 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2780641 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen

2780659 i hadnt had my hair cut in a looooong time and had been going to the same person for years and years who recently switched careers so i
2780660 on the weekends maybe ill stay open later but tonight i have things to do
2780661 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities
2780662 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2780663 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2780664 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2780665 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2780666 be happy in whatever you do dont sweat the small stuff
2780667 why r u asking me all those questions this is very unprofessional
2780668 yes we have that but we dont have that other ingredient that goes in the dish
2780669 to be honest i thought this place was going to be mediocre as hell
2780670 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2780671 play it once in awhile when you can afford it
2780672 what the hell city of sf why cant i just show my drivers license
2780673 the nearest tee time that meets you request is 11 47am would you like to reserve
2780674 one of my favorite pizza places i just wish they had more seating
2780675 make one pizza per day with great fresh organic ingredients yes it must all be vegetarian being given that the fact that this is the city of berkeley
2780676 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2780677 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2780678 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2780679 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2780680 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2780681 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2780682 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2780683 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2780684 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2780685 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2780686 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2780687 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2780688 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2780689 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2780690 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2780691 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2780692 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2780693 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2780694 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2780695 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2780696 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2780697 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2780698 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2780699 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2780700 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2780701 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2780702 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2780703 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2780704 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2780705 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2780706 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2780707 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2780708 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2780709 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2780710 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2780711 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2780712 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2780713 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2780714 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2780715 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2780716 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2780717 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2780718 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2780719 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2780720 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2780721 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2780722 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2780723 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2780724 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2780725 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2780726 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2780727 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2780728 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2780729 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2780730 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2780731 who are open to doing something on the production side
2780732 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2780733 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2780734 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2780735 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2780736 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2780737 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2780738 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2780739 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2780740 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2780741 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2780742 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2780743 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2780744 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2780745 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2780746 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2780747 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2780748 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

2780759 because it is the explanation for our existence and because it explains such a huge number of facts because everything we know about life is explained by it
2780760 i believe in my religion so whenever i read about evolution i cant understand that i dont believe it its just like i believe my religion
2780761 right you know what you believe when you start and any new book that says anything different you dont read it or
2780762 even if youve got evidence ive found a stronger evidence which is the holy book so
2780763 so the reason you believe it is because thats the one you were told first is that a good general
2780764 is that a good reason to believe something do you think
2780765 yeah because i went to church since i was little
2780766 yes but in the hindu sacred scriptures it says something different doesnt it
2780767 yes so you mean everybody should just believe everything that they are brought up to believe even though they contradict each other
2780768 you can be made to believe something in science and then made to believe something in religious studies but then its really up to you what you believe you cant just say that
2780769 well look i hate this phrase made to believe thats an awful thing and i would hate anyone to think i was trying to make anyone believe anything cough ahem richard if this book works as i intend religious readers who open it will be atheists when they put it down im asking you to look at the evidence perhaps you havent got a strong impression of how strong the evidence is nobody has actually seen evolution take place over a long period of time but they have seen the after effects and the after effects are massively supported its a bit like a case in a court of law when nobody can actually stand up and say i saw the muder happen but yet you have got millions and millions of pieces of evidence which no reasonable person could possibly dispute thats sort of the way it is

2780774 of course janice and tommy dont believe in ghosts or haunted houses but when they visit aunt annabelles guest house in maine they begin to wonder
2780775 why does the sinister guest creep around the top floor when he thinks everyone is asleep how about the flickering light that appears out of nowhere in a midnight storm and what can those hoofbeats in the big rock mean
2780776 if janice and tommy are to help aunt annabelle they must prove that mountain view house is not really haunted and there is no time to lose

2780784 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
2780785 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
2780786 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
2780787 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business
2780788 were so very satisfied to be at 40 million plus after five days you couldnt ask for more
2780789 i thought we came out fast on offense and made some plays
2780790 i didnt really like the way the defense started out then after halftime it kind of flipped the defense started running around and doing things right
2780791 i think hes playing at a faster speed than he did all spring
2780792 the offensive line is starting to play well together and is getting a good understanding of what we want to do we need to rush the passer better we showed some fatigue and showed some lack of toughness at times but we did show the ability to rush the passer its always harder on the defensive line when you arent hitting the quarterback because there are some times that you think that you would have had a sack and he still throws the ball
2780793 i really wanted to go outside they told me that it would quit raining in a little while so we warmed up inside and then came out for the scrimmage

2780816 esta platica que tenemos nosotros es para los pobres en primer lugar y la clase media y la clase media no vive en town house
2780817 no es que un ministro no tenga derecho a una vivienda sino que en situaciones como esta hay otros con m s necesidad
2780818 but he chose me and i agreed to marry him right away
2780819 we get calls all the time because of the pet park at presidio
2780820 we dont have a weight limit on pets and our pet park provides a place for the dogs to roam without a leash
2780821 the dog park is the reason i stay at presidio
2780822 i didnt have nettie when i first moved here and four years ago i knew about five people at the complex since i got nettie and began going to the dog park now i know about 40 people the social aspect of the dog park has really helped
2780823 were noticing more baby boomers are pet owners and they are treating their pets like members of the family

2780825 we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2780826 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2780827 i reflect on my childhood my young adulthood the disappointments of life the problems i brought on myself the self pity i went through before i became a man
2780828 i love my wife but i hate her golf game
2780829 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2780830 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2780831 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2780832 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2780833 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2780834 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2780835 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2780836 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2780837 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2780838 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2780839 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2780840 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2780841 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2780842 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2780843 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2780844 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2780845 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2780846 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2780847 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2780848 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2780849 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2780850 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2780851 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2780852 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2780853 los problemas del cuerpo y la inteligencia pr ctica la aventura al aire libre y abierto el choque de las armas y la diplomacia de la vida
2780854 im generally not in favor of term limits nobody is term limiting the lobbyists or the slick operators walking around the halls of congress i believe in one form of term limits theyre called elections
2780855 mr obama knows full well that members of congress have now skewed the laws to give themselves a virtual guarantee of a lifetime job and as the self appointed apostle of change he ought to be taking the lead to change all that inequity

2780866 we are responding to the needs of these companies to speedily and efficiently find a merger or acquisition match that provides the best fit for their goals and ambitions in a competitive and fast paced world
2780867 the resources and the skill of the typical investor group or generalist investment banker are no longer adequate to meet the unique challenges of these special purpose companies those that do not utilize the specialized skills and focus such as we bring to the table may have great difficulties completing a transaction within the time limit or see themselves pressured into marriages that destroy value and the reputation of the investor group

2780872 there was a very very large amount of fire when we arrived and the extent of the explosion if the blast was heard as far away as it was could have been much more serious
2780873 hopefully we wont find that there are a lot of people missing or injured but so far it looks like we got off very lucky
2780874 i certainly dont think it will be days i think it will be hours
2780875 but that all depends on what we run into if we run into some more problems or problems that we dont see now then it could be longer
2780876 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2780877 my whole room lights up orange and i look out i live on the top floor so i had a perfect view and i just seen a huge ball of flame hundreds of metres in the sky big black pillars of smoke
2780878 we got freaked out my family woke up they thought it was a plane that went down

2780881 we were concerned when this company moved at the end of the street
2780882 but we werent even advised that they were going to be there they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen im surprised that they let a company like that move in a residential area
2780883 those concerns always come up as to whether or not they should be in certain areas but like i say unless you want to put those facilities away and not build anything anywhere close to them any residences i dont know that you can do that
2780884 the lord of the rings the return of the king
2780885 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
2780886 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
2780887 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
2780888 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business
2780889 were so very satisfied to be at 40 million plus after five days you couldnt ask for more
2780890 these projects could see this state fully harness the opportunities the resources boom can offer by delivering a 40 percent increase in our coal exporting capacity
2780891 we have seen a number of high profile police in nsw and victoria in trouble

2780898 if you want to build a ship dont drum up people together to collect wood and dont assign them tasks and work but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea

2780900 assuming that one estimated the value of a piece of music according to how much of it could be counted calculated and expressed in formulas how absurd would such a scientific estimation of music be
2780901 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
2780902 if you possess a thousand contradictory aphorisms you have knowledge if you know when to apply each one you have wisdom
2780903 the man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the cooperation or consent of his deliberate reason to such a man the world tends to become definite finite obvious common objects rouse no questions and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected as soon as we begin to philosophize we find that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given
2780904 as long as the world shall last there will be wrongs and if no man objected and no man rebelled those wrongs would last forever

2780914 before using contact centre technology we had a traditional switchboard system which could not cope with the call volumes for our cause marketing initiatives
2780915 thanks to the contact centre weve also been able to reduce operating costs by about 40 this is significant because it means that we can give more money to the beneficiaries
2780916 because it is an all in one solution interactive intelligences system gave the cansa shavathon the ability to have one platform for its contact centre and office environment driving up productivity and reducing integration and maintenance costs
2780917 the system is also easy to use therefore providing an ideal environment to train agents with a low skills base
2780918 this enables significant flexibility for all cause projects and gives the trainees a great sense of achievement
2780919 i am very focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19
2780920 on the one hand they have a responsibility to shareholders on the other they are a government sponsored entity and they havent had a regulator with the necessary powers

2780928 the board of directors has temporarily halted most of chamco autos operations
2780929 an established brand can carry a new entrant in terms of a certain familiarity and comfort among consumers in terms of what the vehicles can represent so its probably a smart choice
2780930 we are eager to begin exporting small cars from china as soon as possible that will attract new customers in two segments in which our brands are underrepresented very young buyers and entry level buyers
2780931 its generally understood that the only way to compete in the ultra price sensitive subcompact market requires the most low cost manufacturing base

2780944 has no connection to roman catholic liturgy or sacraments and cannot in any way be recognized as a valid reception of sacred orders
2780945 the problem is not that all of a sudden there was a tsunami of attempted ordinations of women
2780946 for the good of the church and to ensure bishops have a common way of responding
2780947 they ask why would you excommunicate someone who just wants to serve god
2780948 more and more catholics are accepting the idea of women priests she said
2780949 we are building a renewed model of priesthood for a renewed roman catholic church in a community of equals in which all are welcome at the sacred eucharistic table
2780950 there is no punishment there is nothing the institutional church can do to stop this movement

2780954 theres an injustice within our church that affects the whole world
2780955 compassionate to your sisters women called by god to ordination
2780956 justice shall flourish in his time and fullness of peace forever
2780957 what are you talking about i have been to many ordinations and theyre never by invitation only besides im a daughter of the church and christ welcomes everyone to the table
2780958 we wanted to share our academic work with the security community and had planned to withhold a key detail of our results so that a malicious attacker could not use our research for fraudulent purposes

2781011 you dont want to be going too far into the season without knowing what youre going to be doing the following year
2781012 obviously theres times where we would have liked to have run better this year but at the same point were still leading the rookie of the year standings
2781013 were locked solidly in the top 35 right now our goals are still the same we want to get the car into the top 30 in points by the end of the year and win the rookie of the year if we do that we should be able to get a sponsor for the 01 car no problem thats the main goal right now
2781014 its kind of like of a little bit of a gut shot that hurts a little bit but thats part of the game
2781015 everybodys together pulling hard on the same rope and doing everything we can to keep improving each week

2781059 i knew i was going to need a strong breaststroke when we all turned together
2781060 i knew i was going to have to overpower them
2781061 i looked up and saw president bush giving me a thumbs up and holding the american flag that was pretty cool
2781062 get some calories into my system and try to recover the best i can
2781063 i told longtime coach bob bowman that this would be my last 400 im so ive got to go out there and get a good time
2781064 im a little tired but i am happy to get my first ever olympic medal
2781065 i saw zhang next to me and i just buried my head i was hoping for gold everyone in that race was you cant complain when you get a best time
2781066 all i wanted to do was make it to tomorrow to conserve energy and make it to the final
2781067 i need to bank as much rest as possible and as much sleep as i can and not get run down
2781068 i kind of expected that with the preliminaries at night and the finals in the morning
2781069 subconsciously you are trying really hard because it is night
2781070 this is big i mean we couldnt sleep last night we were restless all day and anxious to get out here and do our thing
2781071 i dont know what kind of statement weve made but we played well
2781072 everyone is proud it felt great all the flags and people cheering it was a great game great atmosphere
2781073 how many times do you get to tell your kids and grandkids you played in the olympics
2781074 we went into the game knowing this tragedy had happened and also knew that four years had gone into this
2781075 we came into the tournament playing wonderful usa volleyball some of the greatest this decade this is about the team not individual people
2781076 as a team there is nothing more important to us than supporting mrs bachman in her struggle and supporting hugh and elisabeth in their grief
2781077 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2781078 hugh has been in touch with the team throughout this tragedy and were extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying they know were here for them in every way possible
2781079 the deputy foreign minister of china went to the hospital to express condolences and sympathy for the relatives of the victims
2781080 the chinese minister of health also went to the hospital to make sure everything possible could be done to help the injured
2781081 we are living in a world where surprises do happen
2781082 on the other hand well reassure you nothing like this will happen again
2781083 three or five criminals were killed and two policemen and one security person were injured i dont believe this will pose any threat to the olympics but of course we will strengthen security measures in this area
2781084 this continuation of their participation very much reflects the olympic spirit and the values of the games
2781085 the ioc believes this is absolutely the right decision most of all for the athletes who have trained so hard and for whom this a once in a lifetime possibly opportunity
2781086 theyve confirmed their participation very much in the light of respect friendship athlete to athlete so we have no reason to have any concerns on that today with regards to any other measures to be taken we dont at this time have any reason to believe thats necessary
2781087 its very difficult for us georgians because of everything thats going on at home
2781088 it was nice that natalia paderina came up to me after and gave me a handshake
2781089 participation in the olympic games athlete to athlete is under the spirit of respect and fair play
2781090 should it be confirmed that there was someone refusing on that basis this would be something the ioc would take seriously but this particular case that you raise hasnt been brought to our attention

2781103 but for some reason white tips are extremely curious they behave like cats most sharks in aquariums dont want anything to do with you if youre diving with them youre a big noisy strange thing in their space but white tips make you feel like theyre interested in you theyll swim through your bubbles theyll come in close to check you out but in a good way not like they want to eat you
2781104 but you cant do that for very long because its like us eating just french fries they need other nutrients and vitamins
2781105 theyre just like a pet dog or cat you can condition them but it takes time and patience

2781169 o abu qudamah tell us about the most amazing thing you have witnessed while in jihaad
2781170 o abu qudamah i was listening to what you mentioned about jihaad and your incitement for muslims to join it i have been blessed with more hair than many other women i have cut it and made a horses rein out of and i have covered it with dust so that no one can recognise it i wish that you take it with you so that when you arrive to the land of the disbelievers and the horsemen engage in battle the arrows are fired the swords are drawn and the spears are pulled out either use it if you find the need for it or hand it to whoever needs it for i wish that my hair will witness the battle and will get the dust in the way of allaah i am a widowed woman who had a husband and a number of relatives who were all killed in allaahs path i would have joined jihaad had it been required of me
2781171 o abu qudamah know that my husband left me a son who is amongst the finest of youths he has learnt the quran the art of swordsmanship as well as archery he prays at night and fasts during the day and he is 15 years of age he is currently away at a property which he has inherited from his father hopefully he will get back before your departure for i wish to send him with you as a gift to allaah the exalted most high and i ask you by allaah that you do not deprive me from gaining the rewards i seek
2781172 o abu qudamah wait for me for a while may allaah have mercy on you
2781173 praised be allaah who did not deny me from your company and did not turn me back disappointed
2781174 my beloved let me see your face for if it is imperative on someone of your age to fight i would command you to join us otherwise i would turn you back
2781175 no in fact i am coming with you seeking revenge for my father who was martyred perhaps allaah will grant me martyrdom as he granted my father
2781176 then go and ask her permission if she permits you to go then come back otherwise stay back with her
2781177 i am the son of the woman who gave you the trust how fast did you forget my mothers request i am insha allaah the martyr son of the martyr i ask you by allaah not to stop me from going forth with you in allaahs way for i memorise allaahs book and have knowledge of the prophets sunnah and i am experienced in horsemanship and shooting and i have not left behind someone who is a better fighter than myself so despise me not for my young age my mother has taken an oath that i should not come back and said o son if you meet the disbelievers turn not your back to them and offer your soul to allaah and seek to be close to allaah and the company of your father and your righteous uncles in the heaven and if allaah grants you martyrdom then intercede on my behalf for i was told that the martyr can plead on behalf of seventy of his relatives and seventy of his neighbours she then hugged me lifted her head to the heavens and said my lord master and god this is my son the flower of my heart and the dearest to my soul i present him to you so draw him nearer to his father
2781178 i saw a vision which i liked and made me laugh
2781179 i saw myself in an elegant green garden while wandering in it i faced a silver castle which had balconies made of pearls and jewels its doors were made of gold and its curtains were lowered i then saw some maids whose faces were like the moons in beauty lifting the curtains upon seeing me they said welcome i then heard some of them saying to the others this is the husband of the mardhiyyah blessed they then said to me come forth may allah have mercy on you when i approached i saw a room on the top of the castle it was made of red gold and had a green bed made of jewels and its legs were made of white silver there was a girl on the bed whose face was like the sun and had it not been for allaahs help i would have lost my sight and i would have lost my mind because of the brilliance of the room and the beauty of the girl upon seeing me the girl greeted me saying welcome o allaahs servant and his beloved you are mine and i am yours i wanted to hug her but she said slow down do not rush you are not one of those who do wrong however we shall meet tomorrow at the time of zuhur prayers so rejoice
2781180 my beloved you saw but good and good it shall be insha allaah
2781181 o allahs horsemen mount and rejoice with march forth whether you are light or heavy quran 9 41
2781182 o uncle did you not hear allaahs saying o you who believe when you meet those who disbelieve in battle a field never turn your backs to them do you wish for me to enter the fire of hell
2781183 o muslims for allaahs sake get my uncle abu qudamah to come to me
2781184 o uncle by the lord of the kabah my dream has come true i am the son of the reins owner
2781185 the likes of you cannot be forgotten you wipe my face with your gown my gown is worthier o uncle leave it for i wish to meet allaah in this state o uncle the hoor girl of paradise that i described to you shes at my head waiting for my soul to depart from my body and she is saying to me hurry i am longing for you o uncle for the sake of allaah if he was to bring you back safely take my blood stained clothes to my poor grieved and sad mother present them to her and tell her allaah has accepted your gift
2781186 i bear witness that there is no god but allaah no partner has he he has kept his promise and i bear witness that muhammad is allaahs servant and messenger this is what allaah and his messenger has promised us and allaah and his messenger were true to their promise
2781187 did you come as a condoler or as a rejoicer
2781188 if my son has come back safe then you are indeed a condoler whereas if he has been killed in allaahs path then you are a rejoicer
2781189 praise be to allaah who spared him for me on the day of judgement

2781201 i expect to see adam back sometime this week if everything goes right
2781202 hickory was the only solid place we could send him were sending him there just to get live at bats were set with adam with one place to play
2781203 were trying to prove people wrong but were trying to prove to ourselves we belong more than anything else thats what it should be all year prove you belong here and you only do that by getting it done on the field
2781204 you start to realize even with some 40 games left every game is very important
2781205 i feel like its definitely a grind we just keep going
2781206 nobody thinks were supposed to be here so what the heck
2781207 but we are here so were going to enjoy the heck out of it and show you why we are here
2781208 were just going to try to take it easy on him for a while and make sure hes ok
2781209 we dont want to lose him again so were just going to dh him
2781210 i think that anytime you can try to get back no matter what the situation you want to get back as quick as possible
2781211 i think right now im at a point where i dont think i can hurt it any further
2781212 obviously i have to try to be conservative at times im going to still go as hard as i can but i want to be here for the rest of the year so ill be smart at some points
2781213 if you erase the last couple of days theres been sign of guys swinging the bats pretty well
2781214 obviously were still not to the point where we need to be but things have changed drastically over the last few weeks were moving in the right direction

2781219 i would be very direct with russian president vladimir putin that these actions will have consequences long term in terms of our relationship with russia and it is in violation of the norms of international conduct

2781227 we are spending 10 to 12 billion dollars a month in iraq and if were spending that money in iraq we can spend some of that money right here in in hawaii right here in the united states of america
2781228 it may just be words but its important guiding principles of what we stand for
2781229 they said more than likely i wouldnt beat it so theres kind of no point to go through with it and that more than likely it would be a waste of time
2781230 even if youre not guilty the evidence is too strong against you to have a chance
2781231 so that the worse that could happen is what happens instead of 10 days it probably wont set me back too much
2781232 they said more than likely i wouldnt beat it so theres kind of no point to go through with it and that more than likely it would be a waste of time

2781237 absolutely hes ready to be commander in chief and im going to do everything in my power to make sure that happens
2781238 well dick cheney was one of the most experienced persons ever to serve at the highest levels of the executive branch and hes been an unmitigated catastrophe so obviously theres more to this job than experience theres also a judgment component and i have no doubt that barack will exercise rock solid judgment as commander in chief and wont that be a nice change of pace from the last seven and a half years

2781240 our road will not be easy the cynics where lobbyists write check after check and exxon turns record profits thats what happens when lobbyists set the agenda its a game where trade deals like nafta ship jobs overseas and force parents to compete with their teenagers to work for minimum wage at wal mart its a game ceo bonuses while another mother goes without health care for her sick child we cant keep driving a wider and wider gap between the few who are rich and the rest who struggle to keep pace even if theyre not rich
2781241 lies awake at night wondering how hes going to pay the bills she works the night shift after a full day of college and still cant afford health care for a sister whos ill the senior i met who lost his pension when the company he gave his life to went bankrupt the teacher who works at dunkin donuts after school just to make ends meet i was not born into money or status ive fought to bring jobs to the jobless in the shadow of a shuttered steel plant to make sure people werent denied their rights because of what they looked like or where they came from now we carry our message to farms and factories
2781242 we can cast off our doubts and fears and cynicism because our dream will not be deferred our future will not be denied and our time for change has come
2781243 whatever happened to that obama who spoke at the 2004 democratic convention that enemy of excessive partisanship and evangelist of national unity

2781484 project eagle is the biggest milestone lotus has achieved since the elise was born 13 years ago we are currently working at broadening the 15th appeal of the lotus brand through an aggressive 5 year model plan of which this car represents the first exciting step
2781485 project eagles dynamically sculptured form and dramatic proportions communicate visual drama speed and agility even when the car is standing still sportscars are primarily an emotional rather than a rational purchase and so the design must seduce with its beauty and distinctive character however the modern customer also demands that the product offers real world usability as well as exotic imagery therefore every element of the cars exterior and interior has been carefully designed to create a product that offers comfort and convenience as well as traditional performance car attributes

2781571 states parties shall use their best efforts to ensure recognition of the principle that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of the child
2781572 the best interests of the child will be their basic concern
2781573 when article 18 was being drafted the delegate from the commented that it was rather strange to set down responsibilities for private individuals since the convention could only be binding on ratifying governments
2781574 recognizes that parents and legal guardians have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the child with the best interest of the child as their basic concern
2781575 a secondary responsibility to provide appropriate assistance to parents and legal guardians in meeting their responsibilities
2781576 decision and policy makers with the authority to substitute their own decisions for either the childs or the parents
2781577 by placing the burden on the state to take affirmative steps toward ensuring the fulfillment of childrens rights the convention assumes responsibility and invokes the state as the ensurer and protector of rights
2781578 an arguably new standard for state intervention in intact families
2781579 under the crc parental childrearing rights are subject to external scrutiny and may be overridden when the parents are not acting in the best interests of the child

2781640 my inference is that they concluded that this administration would not release hamdan at the end of his sentence but the next one might
2781641 i think hamdans continued detention past the end of his sentence although justifiable under the law of war would be a political train wreck and i think the panel made an effort to protect the u s from further international criticism

2781747 oh jehovah please heal her i need her so much
2781748 how will i nourish and care for this little one without her wise counsel
2781749 jehovah mighty god of father abraham hear my prayer heal my mother with your mighty power you who named the stars who made a nation from slaves
2781750 one of the most indefensible things the bush administration has done in the last few years
2781751 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2781752 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2781753 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2781754 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2781755 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2781756 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2781757 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2781758 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2781759 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2781760 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2781761 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2781762 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2781763 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2781764 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2781765 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2781766 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2781767 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2781768 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2781769 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2781770 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2781771 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2781772 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2781773 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2781774 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2781775 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2781776 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2781777 get some rest after this okay its late get some rest
2781778 sure thatd be awesome one big group picture yeah 8d
2781779 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2781780 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2781781 de c nd am v zut programul era clar c este foarte dificil n primele trei etape nt lnind grup ri de cupele europene
2781782 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2781783 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2781784 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2781785 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2781786 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2781787 nu ne g ndim cum vor evolua fotbali tii care au venit de la dinamo n acest meci vor juca fotbali tii care sunt n form i care merit s evolueze cred c juc torii veni i de la dinamo sunt profesioni ti i i doresc s dovedeasc faptul c au valoare n meciul sta ei vor juca pentru otopeni nu le interzic s fie suporterii clubului de unde au venit aici nsa vreau ca n acest meci s fie cu noi pot conta pe fotbali tii veni i de la dinamo

2781789 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2781790 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2781791 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2781792 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2781793 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2781794 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2781795 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2781796 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2781797 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2781798 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2781799 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2781800 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2781801 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2781802 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2781803 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2781804 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2781805 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2781806 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2781807 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2781808 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2781809 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2781810 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

2781814 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
2781815 every soldier and officer should absolutely disobey any order to kill muslims or aid their killers
2781816 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2781817 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2781818 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2781819 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2781820 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2781821 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2781822 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

2781827 with rising prices on everything from gas to groceries its important to have a card that saves you money its no wonder why everyone is so excited about the dater card
2781828 the card is inexpensive looks sleek and offers a ton of great discounts year round i look forward to buying it as a gift for family and friends
2781829 we want people to go out and enjoy themselves as often as possible without having to spend full price every time

2781836 i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
2781837 it was our first game we were very anxious we missed shots that we normally would hit but at the end of the day you win by almost 30 points youve got to take good things out of that
2781838 we played very very hard we give ourselves a chance defensively every night thats what its all about with us

2781842 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
2781843 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
2781844 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
2781845 we are shocked by this terrible tragedy and our hearts go out to ingrid riveras family and friends we are grateful to the new york police department for arresting a suspect in this crime we continue to cooperate with police and answer any questions they may have

2781867 have been postulated to play a very important role in neurocommunication but in this field essentially no critical studies have been performed to address this issue
2781868 so i set up an experiment to create an animal model in which a particular group of neurons in the brain couldnt release a small neurotransmitter and by examining those animal models i could know the function of those molecules
2781869 we found that the mice without gaba release from agrp neurons have increased energy expenditure and are resistant to diet induced obesity
2781870 the function of agrp neurons is probably to reserve the energy for maintaining life
2781871 so if the animal doesnt have enough food the animal should have some strategy to preserve energy and this group of neurons by releasing gaba restrains energy expenditure to maintain enough energy to survive under the conditions in which food is not readily available
2781872 i think it makes the role of gaba in obesity much more relevant than previously thought
2781873 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting

2781876 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
2781877 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
2781878 id also like to see you reprise your lesson from the union square event some time ago on extracting minimal value from the network you create so the network grows as large as possible and the value youve created and can extract in the end is greater than if you had tried to extract more value at the beginning did i get that right i quote you to that effect all the time did it just the other day with a big publisher whose blog ad network is taking too high a cut i told him to just cover his costs for the first year or less and hed end up growing something bigger that would be more valuable to each member thus bigger thus more valuable to him eh

2781897 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2781898 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2781899 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2781900 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2781901 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2781902 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2781903 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2781904 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2781905 ich finde es gut dass meine spieler 120 minuten gehen und sich berwinden mussten jeder wei jetzt woran er noch arbeiten muss

2781934 di kejurnas mereka sukses mengalahkan kita dan merebut satu medali emas maka karena ini adalah nomor paling bergengsi dan mereka adalah juara bertahan maka kita harus ekstra waspada demikian juga dengan dua tim lainnya filipina dan sarolangun
2781935 no s c mo nos vamos a recuperar de esta derrota creo que s lo puedo contestar despu s de que juguemos el siguiente encuentro perder en el partido del debut es algo que a nosotros no nos hab a ocurrido nunca antes
2781936 anotaron un lanzamiento m s son un gran equipo y argentino no estuvo tan lista como deber a
2781937 tardamos mucho tiempo en entrar a jugar nuestro partido precisamente por eso porque era nuestro debut pero al margen de eso mejoramos y llegamos a un final apretado
2781938 a los errores defensivos los triples lituanos y la falta de punter a desde la larga distancia
2781939 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2781940 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2781941 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2781942 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2781943 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2781944 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2781945 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2781946 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2781947 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2781948 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here

2781954 we will offer a resolution today that makes clear that the russian actions in georgia are unacceptable to the international community and we condemn this military assault
2781955 well see whats in there then well know what to do
2781956 its too bad that the russians didnt leave the shooting to the olympic competition yesterday in which the russians and the georgians peacefully shared silver and bronze medals

2781962 o limite que define as faixas de cada classe eu concordo que arbitr rio uma simplifica o o que mostramos de mais importante que est havendo um crescimento dela e que mesmo com as crises internacionais esse movimento continuou em 2008

2781969 america ah is is no longer what it could be what it once was i dont want that future for my children
2781970 the book is based quite a bit on the theory of co evolution
2781971 which is the idea that wolves and later dogs are what made us the dominant species on the planet that we evolved because of them and they evolved because of us
2781972 we made dogs and dogs made us some of the genetic research is fairly controversial but there is some evidence that wolves and humans have been together for 150 000 years and other evidence that suggests it could have happened before we were even fully human
2781973 i have to admit the reason i went into the arts was that i was a really good student in english and a fair student in science it has worked out well because i love science at the conceptual level but i get to a certain point where if there are unknowns i get very frustrated
2781974 and whats fun about being a fiction writer based in science is that when people dont know the answers you get to make them up
2781975 the ridgeline channels the companys vast experience with motorcycles dirt bikes atvs marine engines personal water craft power equipment and automotive products
2781976 the end result is a truck designed to best meet the needs of people who take family work and recreation seriously all around its the right tool for the job
2781977 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
2781978 philadelphia needs thousands of more racks if its going to be a sustainable and green city and we hope that others including agencies and private property owners will follow the authoritys example
2781979 the combination of the food music and dancing during the slow food bbq creates a feel that only greenfield village could create
2781980 as summer begins to wind down this event is a great chance to appreciate excellent foods locally grown
2781981 we wanted to present mitsubishi as a positive and fun to drive option that provided both fuel efficiency and performance
2781982 it goes without saying that todays consumer is looking for fuel efficiency
2781983 mitsubishi has a quartet of four cylinder vehicles that provide fuel economy without sacrificing performance we challenged traffic to grab consumers attention with this message and i think were going to do that very successfully with the phenomenal four campaign
2781984 this project is a great opportunity for the forest service and the forest visitors to work with hummer and tread lightly who are dedicated to providing recreational experiences while protecting the integrity of the forest
2781985 they are the result of effective sales strategies combined with offering the newest quality vehicle lineup in the market the best warranty advanced technology and attractive designs to satisfy the needs of our market
2781986 this is without question the best ford lineup weve ever produced and it comes at a critically important time for the company
2781987 our product led transformation is well under way and there is much more to come
2781988 our strategy is clear deliver great new fun to drive vehicles that take a backseat to no one when it comes to quality and fuel efficiency
2781989 in addition virtually our entire lineup benefits from new powertrains ford exclusive smart technology and more safety features
2781990 we are committed to being the best or among the best in fuel economy with every new ford product in its segment
2781991 we are making this happen with one of the most extensive powertrain upgrades ever for ford by the end of 2010 nearly all of fords north american engines will be upgraded or replaced
2781992 ride in a vehicle like the new 2009 ford flex and youll be amazed at the quiet interior
2781993 for many customers not having to speak loudly in the back seat is a significant quality indicator we are improving quality on every front and were serious about getting even better
2781994 i think the most important thing about the meeting is the tribal sheiks and the religious leaders who represent leaders of sadr city had an opportunity to meet and interface with key people from the government of iraq
2781995 the meetings present a forum for people to first meet and to introduce one another
2781996 i would say that realistically probably most of the real work is done in side meetings or in less formal working group meetings after these formal meetings
2781997 we have weapons and were ready to begin joint patrols with the iraqi army
2781998 were willing to cooperate with the people of sadr city in any way possible
2781999 like all these other meetings they can sometimes be contentious but overall it was a positive meeting
2782000 it takes away the human dimension from each of the individuals so that youre dealing with the words on a cell phone screen but not doing the same kind of connecting to the full person which is important in weighing whether to stay or go in a relationship
2782001 images of their face their sense of smell the sound of their voice
2782002 you have to do the physical work of putting it in an envelope addressing it and carrying it to the post box
2782003 if someone needs to pick up milk on the way home and its great for even quick little communications of terms of endearment i cant wait to see you but i dont think its a way people should use to negotiate relationships
2782004 they require time texting is a time saver relationships i believe should be time intensive we shouldnt short cut our relationships
2782005 you may want to say it very differently 24 hours later
2782006 so dry and so reduced to the minimal terms of human communication
2782007 the means of communications that we have are a mirror of our society and we live in a society thats expedient we dont want to take the time to think things over we dont have the time most of the time to dwell on painful hurtful situations we just want to get over it and move on
2782008 id have to leave before the sun came up to get there by
2782009 i like to make sure everything is analyzed and all my bases are covered
2782010 but i dont lose any sleep thinking about not coming back
2782011 obviously it would be a travesty not to be around to enjoy my children afterwards but that is life i dont let that deter me from going forward
2782012 you just lay down and sleep in the bottom of the boat and of course you cant sleep in a storm
2782013 that was back in 1983 i was wrong and i have stated i was wrong sir im very proud of my record im not saying it is perfect
2782014 i know what it is like to be deprived of your rights i know what its like to be in confinement i know what its like to be beaten i know what its like so i think i have a special appreciation that maybe a lot of people dont have for what its like to be deprived of your rights we all improve over the years and we learn and we grow
2782015 obviously we want voter registration all over america well do everything we can to get maximum turnout

2782018 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
2782019 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
2782020 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
2782021 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water
2782022 swimming research has strived to understand water flow around a swimmer for decades because how a swimmers body moves the surrounding water is everything
2782023 the ability to measure flow and forces in a natural and unimpeded environment hasnt been available until recently and dr weis technology and methods presented usa swimming with a unique opportunity that united states swimmers and coaches could learn a lot from
2782024 how often does a researcher get to do something like this
2782025 its been a journey into a world that someone like me would have never before gotten the privilege to see first hand
2782026 its everyones dream to make a difference and im excited to keep helping the team for as long as they need me
2782027 the first touchdown felt good because the first team was in there against their first team
2782028 it was crazy my first block out there was zach thomas
2782029 once you do that nothing really worries you anymore once you get out there its football
2782030 we didnt turn it over or have any penalties in the first half thats a good sign that youre not making any silly mistakes in the first preseason game
2782031 ive been definitely able to see progress at training camp and we were able to carry it over from practice to the game
2782032 hopefully by the last preseason game ill be ready and focused to go my timing is messed up right now but ill be alright man
2782033 we didnt play our first group very long offensively and defensively
2782034 that was on purpose one they looked sharp when they were in there two we needed to look at the rest of the guys
2782035 this is incredibly valuable information that could be used for many purposes including better traffic signal timing and management of construction work zones to reduce congestion as well as real time traffic information for motorists
2782036 now we have a way to measure how slow traffic is on a given stretch of road or how long its taking people to get through airport security at a given concourse and time of day
2782037 we came up with the idea at indot and developed the prototype this year from off the shelf hardware
2782038 information is a commodity people are aggressively seeking and this method promises to cost effectively provide information that has never been widely available to travelers
2782039 it gives you quantitative 24 hour feedback on traffic flow information we can use for design and operation decisions
2782040 agencies need quantitative data so they can make informed decisions about how to allocate resources and how well design changes are working
2782041 thats important because it means basically every hundredth vehicle is tracked so the travel time information is accurate and updated
2782042 with improved antenna mounting we expect to do even better
2782043 i am joseph your brother whom you sold into egypt but dont be angry with yourselves that you did this to me for god did it he sent me here ahead of you to preserve your lives these two years of famine will grow to seven during which there will be neither plowing nor harvest god has sent me here to keep you and your families alive so that you will become a great nation yes it was god who sent me here not you and he has made me a counselor to pharaoh manager of his entire household and ruler over all egypt
2782044 hold on babe lets check the charger score cuz i know roman will be sayin shit
2782045 sometimes you act like your six and sometimes like youre sixty
2782046 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2782047 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2782048 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2782049 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2782050 martin dx1 review into your search bar youll get nearly 500 hits
2782051 he averaged 28 3 points a game during the regular season
2782052 most chinese fans love yao ming but they also love bryant lebron james dwight howard and carmelo anthony
2782053 if theres an olympic event where chinese will cheer for another nation its basketball
2782054 it was a reaction that i dont even have to describe you have to understand what liz bachman is to usa volleyball shes probably the nicest person in the entire world her and her family
2782055 her family is like our family because they traveled with us she fought in the 2004 olympics with us she was my roommate in 2004
2782056 i see no changes wake up in the mornin and i ask myself is life worth living should i blast myself im tired of being poor even worse im black
2782057 i didnt really feel that great going into the ready room i got these cold chills
2782058 im emotional excited its a really good way to start
2782059 stephanie was a little bit better and im just excited to be on the podium to be under the old world record is awesome
2782060 im definitely not going to show what ive got until the final
2782061 i wasnt expecting for the norway guy to go that fast hes definitely on for his race but everybody else just looks kind of scared the entire semifinal one field sat there to watch my semifinal race and what i was going to do because now ive got everybody thinking why is he going so slow
2782062 i won my first world championships in lane two and that was my breakout meet and im going to be in lane two
2782063 with how the year has gone this is the best shape i could be in right now and probably the best shape of my life
2782064 i cant express how excited i am to be able to start off with that event how it turned out
2782065 i knew i had to go out fast in order to be in the race
2782066 i think that backstroke kind of took a lot out of me
2782067 its a pretty difficult offense to learn itll take some time but i think well be fine
2782068 weve had several prices increases that have totaled 60 70 percent from all the manufacturers in the past year and a half so prices for most shells are going to reflect those increases
2782069 i can count the number of days on one hand where youre sweating already before the race even starts
2782070 we had ice packs on our backs already and that never happens
2782071 i dont know whether thats got anything to do with it
2782072 you cant put all the gloominess on china its a worldwide issue
2782073 the wind was up all day and the greens were firm and there were an awful lot of really tight pin placements that made it really tough to get it close and there were not any easy birdies out there
2782074 you never want to end your round with a three putt or any bogey
2782075 that hole is so tough that a par always feels like birdie
2782076 i knew he was a little bit slow and i could see us catching him and to get him on the last corner was pretty fantastic
2782077 i think this is the view dario had on the last lap in chicago last year
2782078 i just feel like a weight is off my shoulders just a huge relief
2782079 weve come close we havent been able to close the deal
2782080 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2782081 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2782082 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2782083 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i will have a chance for tomorrow i have to wait but its great to be here
2782084 i guess the course is going to change quite a bit
2782085 its still going to be playing difficult but probably not to the extreme it was playing the last couple of days
2782086 as you grow older you tend to try to calm down a little bit more and realize what you have to do that its going to help you be the best player you can be out there
2782087 obviously its a tough major and we know that we are not used to seeing this kind of major on a pga championship but its still a major so you just got to realize it and just keep playing hard and hopefully you will be there on sunday
2782088 this has a greater significance than anything ive ever been part of
2782089 it will be the highest energy game ive ever been part of
2782090 if they dont understand this they dont know what theyre talking about its simple youre playing for your country
2782091 thats the first time id ever heard those usa chants in person and it was the most amazing thing ever
2782092 nobody in l a wants to win for the lakers more than me everybody knows it but this is something totally different
2782093 if we dont win the gold medal i might not be a u s citizen anymore
2782094 carmelo anthony would be puerto rican lebron would be russian and ill be italian just call me antonio
2782095 the market has opened up now well see how the league responds to it
2782096 we dont want people to have the wrong impression that we are selfish and cant play team basketball
2782097 we have to change the way people look at us
2782098 i dont know if either one of us has a lot to be proud of today
2782099 i think both of us will be looking to get some momentum in the morning hoping it will carry us through on whats going to be a long day
2782100 this isnt the ryder cup week we have three weeks to go i want a guy who is confident and if the guys confidence is shattered when he left here join the club
2782101 i spent a lot of time in the fitness trailer ive got an elbow issue
2782102 so i was warming it up and then id go practice then re warming it up and then going to practice again and i was eating and watching the olympics and talking and taking a nap i just kind of covered all the bases
2782103 hes so aggressive right now i think brian orakpo has been good for sam to tell him get here faster or you gotta be tougher
2782104 this senior class the older guys are doing a lot better job of coaching the younger ones than our previous two years we think its bringing some of those younger ones on quicker
2782105 sam acho eddie jones and henry melton gave us the chance to move lamarr houston inside and not have a dropoff
2782106 its not that much of a difference to me i played left tackle all through high school and when i started out here i played left
2782107 as a swing guy i went to right tackle when cedric dockery went down its just switching from right technique to left technique its not a big deal
2782108 hes pure size hes 320 something pounds but he doesnt look like it you look at him and he can really move
2782109 hes a great christian young man you put him on that field and all he does is block people and get after them it doesnt feel outwardly as nasty but hes got a great tenacity level
2782110 if they dont have that theyre going to have a hard time playing so all of them i would like to think have a good degree of it
2782111 i get a little bit of time with john chiles every day quite a bit hes doing a nice job i think you can definitely see spurts where hes very comfortable there
2782112 working on the little things is always a challenge for any wide receiver john taking a bunch of snaps at quarterback and then coming out in certain packages and playing wideout its just going to be a learning process for him
2782113 i think everybodys got a right to run for president who qualifies under the constitution
2782114 id be the last person to begrudge anybody their ambition
2782115 israella darmawan is every inch a teacher from her shiny cap of black hair to her sensible shoes in an office at the fransiskus assisi school she shows me an old register with an entry for barry soetoro as barack obama was know then bu is taught obama in the first grade she admits she doesnt remember all her students well but barry well he stood out
2782116 q if at the time of my birth one of my parents was not a kenya citizen and i was born in kenya is it possible that i have dual citizenship if the answer is yes up to which age a kenya constitution section 97 1 6 a states that any person who upon the attainment of the age of twenty one years is a citizen of kenya and also a citizen of another country other than kenya shall cease to be a citizen of kenya upon the specified date 6 a that is twenty three 23 years
2782117 q what happens to a person who is under 23 and has dual nationality a if such a person wishes to retain kenya citizenship he she is advised to renounce other nationality before the age of 23 years failure to renounce results in automatic loss of kenya citizenship after age 23
2782118 fact or fiction if true which hospital was remodeled between the supposed date of his birth and was close to the apartment his grandparents moved to
2782119 so what it doesnt matter you are all just racist
2782120 knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of a material fact to induce another to act to his or her detriment
2782121 hip hop is a celebration of not only what is right but what is wrong in society
2782122 i think he just does it to make sure we know whats going on
2782123 im pretty sure he always knows exactly whats going on on the field
2782124 the first thing that jumps out at you is the team speed
2782125 the maturity level is always the no 1 concern when youve got a lot of young guys
2782126 how are they going to react under pressure how are they going to act in a tough situation how are they going to react when a negative play happens how are they going to act when a positive play happens can you move onto the next thing
2782127 however what i really liked is in the past year hes made a concerted effort to be a better rebounder and use his size inside to take advantage of matchups
2782128 he was always a shooter but hes made an effort to drive to the basket to attack the rim
2782129 i think that was a good move on his part
2782130 coach barnes said he needed a bigger version of a j
2782131 it popped in my head to lay it down in the fairway and hit a shot down there
2782132 if the pin was easier you might have saw a bit more of that but where they put the pin its pretty much impossible you have to try to get up where you can chip on
2782133 just because its a shorter hole doesnt make it a great hole
2782134 we have a billion dollars worth of revenue at stake here so that means were not public television for better or worse
2782135 the olympics to me is a benchmark for how fast weve gone with technology
2782136 thirty months ago no one was talking about youtube now its a verb
2782137 its like i forgot how to play golf i looked like a 20 handicap
2782138 i didnt three putt a single green with the hybrid and that was after five three putts with the regular one
2782139 i might bend my putter to an 18 degree loft tonight maybe thats the way to putt these greens
2782140 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2782141 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2782142 i dont think too many people question that i think a lot of people question what happened this offseason
2782143 when i wake up in the morning and look in the mirror this is my challenge
2782144 i want to win on a road course and its the last chance i have this year to do it
2782145 i just want more laps to get in the rhythm of road course racing i seem to have the pace for a handful of laps doing the right thing
2782146 im not sure if its being overaggressive what that really is
2782147 i really noticed the first day that it was pretty smoggy we landed on the plane and i think we were all like wow is this weather is this smog is this fog what is it it was kind of surprising to see that
2782148 the air quality i think its good it looks a little bit misty you cannot judge the air quality by its appearance you have to trust the scientists
2782149 i wont talk about any specific cases or individuals but we wouldnt offer a scholarship if we knew they had problems with the law
2782150 texas is one of the hardest schools when it comes to looking at character
2782151 when youre looking at a guys physical attributes you can just watch him and find out if hes got what youre looking for you dont know if hes always going to develop but you know if the foundation is there
2782152 but its the character that weve got to do a lot of research on now
2782153 this is a hard deal we try to research guys the best we can we talk to coaches high school counselors principals parents teachers opposing coaches we talk to everybody and its still not an exact science
2782154 i think they almost ask more questions about character now than they do about a players athletic ability
2782155 well the ones that do more research some of these schools offer kids scholarships before they even come talk to us
2782156 they see them at a recruiting camp and they offer him there then they come and ask questions not texas or texas a amp m they ask questions first then offer
2782157 one of the main issues some schools have is all these high school coaches want players to go to big time programs
2782158 its a big deal when youre a high school coach and one of your players goes to texas or oklahoma florida or usc its more attention more press so these coaches want their players going to these big schools
2782159 i dont know if high school coaches lie to college coaches but they might not be 100 percent forthcoming about the kids background youve got to know a high school coach is being honest with you
2782160 if theyve got good values in their family and they tell you the truth they call you when theyre supposed to they show up when theyre supposed to they e mail back when you e mail them and theyve done things for the school and leadership with the community theyre responsible those are no brainers but that makes sense
2782161 we prefer kids from two parent families because they tend to be more stable
2782162 more recently weve accepted kids from one parent families because half the kids come from those homes now our rule is that there has to be one strong parent as a role model
2782163 if we have trouble with the parents we dont recruit the kid
2782164 if hes got a high test score and low grades it means he hasnt really been working as hard and isnt putting as much effort into school
2782165 a confident kid is going to have success and isnt as prone to falling into something because of peer pressure
2782166 youve got to talk to the assistant coaches coaches of their opponents the coaches of the opponent might not know as much about character but theyre good to talk to the more people you talk to the more you know the kid youre recruiting
2782167 youd like to think that youre aware of most of the stuff that happens off the field
2782168 even in a class 5a program you hear about most the stuff that happens off the field
2782169 the way i see it is if i have kept a kid on my football team hes worth any college recruiting if he wasnt worth it he wouldnt be on my team
2782170 there have been some times throughout my career i dont know if its 20 percent 15 percent or 10 percent sometimes guys who you think are good for your place somewhere along the line they do something that you know theyre not a fit for your place
2782171 you get fooled for a while but usually the kids characters reveal themselves
2782172 thats the best way to explain it having fun all this makes everything that i did to get here worthwhile
2782173 i just thought if i kept working hard everything would finally fall into place
2782174 mikes not the kind of guy who comes out here looking for personal gain
2782175 he comes out here and tries to do the best he can every day to help the club win he works hard and gets his work in in the last home stand he made a base running mistake the next day he was out there trying to get it straightened out
2782176 im playing in the big leagues now and they know how long ive worked at it to get here
2782177 i just have the feeling theyre with me all the way
2782178 i think that is going to be one of the most watched games in sports history
2782179 how cool how good is it that were going to play in a game that might be the most viewed game in the history of sport come on
2782180 i remember growing up inner city of chicago shooting at a basket in a schoolyard hoping that one person would watch me and now im going to have a chance to coach my countrys team in front of a billion people are you kidding
2782181 the energy the one thing about these games is that they are shorter games than nba games teams can get hot and stay hot and all of a sudden you find yourselves in a dogfight i think thats a danger you face
2782182 i love the chinese people and i love the fans here so hopefully they wont hate us too long
2782183 when he got hurt i was more concerned with him being healthy than anything because i know how big and how important playing in front of his country is to him
2782184 it would have been different if i wasnt still throwing 99 mph it was a different feeling that i never had so i just wanted to make sure
2782185 in my 20 plus years on the water in texas bays ive never caught a fish that looked like this
2782186 they were very aggressive fighters for their size with a mouthful of razor sharp teeth their skin was not at all slimy and felt almost snake like the first was about 13 inches long and the second closer to 11
2782187 it helped us gather our thoughts and get us back on track
2782188 he takes the job very seriously the fans were pretty hard on us last summer and were tired of that thats not who we are and its been corrected
2782189 they meet once a week to discuss issues on the team and whos having problems
2782190 this year were not dealing with problems it was a distraction last year
2782191 he really cares about the players heck when freshman kheeston randall got sick he brought him soup
2782192 you can only see 10 percent of it ninety percent of the ice is under water thats who you really are
2782193 you dont get to do too much tackling out in the centres and generally when youre playing on the wing you just catch cold but it was fun and im excited to be playing rugby
2782194 i got a little bit too excited at one stage but it was just a good feeling being out there and playing
2782195 im a professional sportsman and i know what i need to do to get out there and perform to my best
2782196 ive just concentrated on what i have to do and thats learning the game learning what the team is trying to do and learning my role within the team
2782197 im fully focused im a rugby union player now and ive got goals that ive set so this is just the start hopefully to a long and successful rugby career
2782198 theres short term goals and theres long term goals like playing for the all blacks
2782199 i want to become a dominant no 13 and be considered one of the best centres going around in world rugby and i want to play for the all blacks one day but first i just want to play good footy i want to win the competition with toulon and repay the faith that tana has shown in me by getting out there and helping his team
2782200 one hundred per cent its a new game and a new challenge and i know ive got a lot to learn but im excited to be learning off one of the all time greats in tana umaga
2782201 i think if i am as committed as i was to playing rugby league and learning the game then the next two years will work out
2782202 i think probably a forward going into the forwards would be a lot more difficult because theres a lot of things that are different
2782203 in the backs its still hard because of all the technical things its not as easy as people think
2782204 its just all the little things i have to pick up the rucks the positional play the calls and the moves
2782205 mitch said complete bunch of cunts i just dont bother watching it but i m forced to pay for it cant it be made subscription or advert based then we can have our telly tax back

2782211 theres my rope thats what im going to kill myself with
2782212 i saw you run over here and try to beat me in line
2782213 sir you look like you could probably out run me
2782214 two things one i never started any mess with someone i knew could beat me two whenever someone in my life was stressing me out i got rid of em or avoided them like the plague that way i was happy more than i was sad
2782215 they didnt kill the guy he died of natural causes but they were all about not letting the situation go to waste
2782216 how are we going to cash it lets bring him with us they must watch too many movies
2782217 witnesses observed mr cintron flopping from side to side and these individuals propping him up as they rolled along
2782218 they were trying to pass the guy off as alive

2782240 im hoping that theyll re list the property with me
2782241 its a challenge for midsize cities to raise this kind of money for conventions like these

2782278 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports

2782287 i have no idea ive not spoken to him about that as youre aware im sure senator edwards announced through one of his staffers he would not be attending the convention in denver
2782288 lets be very honest theres weakness when it comes to both political parties i feel very badly for john and elizabeth who are friends i know them and i know their families theyre going through a very difficult time i hope they can resolve this between them
2782289 obviously he let a lot of people down i feel for elizabeth but you know the public is forgiving obviously this is something between himself and his family and voters you know i feel for that family i still believe that john edwards is committed to reducing poverty i think his concern in the campaign was genuine
2782290 this is a difficult period you know but im just not going to be one of those that pile on richardson continued
2782291 barack obama has such a squeaky clean family image but its not over i dont think anybody in political circles including democrats believes edwards claim that he is not the father of this child
2782292 and then you additionally you have the money angle which is fred baron big trial lawyer big supporter of john edwards paying millions of dollars to relocate rielle hunter and andrew young and his family the man who has claimed paternity for the child to california supposedly just out of the goodness of his heart and without telling john edwards
2782293 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2782294 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2782295 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2782296 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2782297 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2782298 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2782299 with a restive electorate with an economy thats sort of chugging around with a war in the background at the end of eight years of republican rule in the white house obama should be way ahead
2782300 john mccain is an underdog may be the understatement of the decade
2782301 the mood of the country is very sour about the current administration people dont like the party as much as they did four years ago
2782302 if someone had told me a year ago when we started the real quest for the primary that we could wind up dead even with the democratic nominee in this kind of a political environment just before our convention that would have been fantastic to me
2782303 one is he needs to use the 12 weeks that are left to lay out a bold agenda for domestic reform and he also needs to talk more about his character
2782304 needs to recognize that every election is about the future and he needs to describe who he is
2782305 rather than saying you know what heres who i am and heres what im about hes responded by saying no im not which is the wrong answer
2782306 if the question is who is not george bush barack obama is the answer if the question is who are you and do you have a vision for the future the answer can be sen mccain

2782314 a lot of people are pretty angry that the propane company was actually brought into the neighbourhood
2782315 weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2782316 it appears to be a situation of the facility being there and the residential area growing around it
2782317 we will be studying it in the days to come
2782318 certainly this is a highly charged and emotional time for residents right now our chief concern is safety of the site we want to make sure the residents are taken care of
2782319 those concerns always come up as to whether or not they should be in certain areas but like i say unless you want to put those facilities away and not build anything anywhere close to them any residences i dont know that you can do that

2782325 the torch lighting was amazing that guys hip flexors and his right arm must have been killing him other than that it was just a great performance i dont think anyone expected anything like that
2782326 walking around the stadium was awesome the environment was great and everyone was chanting u s a and there was just a sea of u s athletes to be able to be a part of it was just awesome the crowd was really excited for us and cheering for us so that was kind of cool

2782357 i think for full restoration of the constitution and for the survival of this nation and for democracy in this country it is very necessary that gen musharraf resigns himself otherwise the impeachment will start
2782358 the numbers are there that is written on the wall it is better that he should say goodbye and leave

2782392 starts with a lot of potential with rock guitars a rocking groove lets say pretty interesting this is the kennedy remix and i dont know whos singing along but yeah this is actually pretty good well produced
2782393 almond oil is extremely toxic and is banned for all cosmetic or aromatherapy purposes only grades processed to remove the hydrocyanic acid are considered safe the forgoing advice says nothing about the grades
2782394 ill tell you who should be tortured and killed at guantanamo every filthy democrat in the u s congress
2782395 to fight only the al qaeda scum is to miss the terrorist network operating within our own borders who are these traitors every rotten radical left winger in this country thats who
2782396 it is not a stretch to say that moveon is the new klan
2782397 im thinking about killing michael moore and im wondering if i could kill him myself or if i would need to hire somebody to do it no i think i could
2782398 we need to execute people like john walker in order to physically intimidate liberals by making them realize that they can be killed too
2782399 i dont see any difference between arianna huffington and the nazis
2782400 the islamofascists are actually campaigning for the election of democrats islamofascists from ahmadinejad to al zawahiri oba osama bin laden whoever are constantly issuing democrat talking points
2782401 there are things in life worth fighting and dying for and one of em is making sure nancy pelosi doesnt become the house speaker
2782402 my only regret with timothy mcveigh is he did not go to the new york times building
2782403 no fede li puoi prendere per domani mi presti le ballerine
2782404 every pastry chef makes pastry cream but how he makes it and what he flavors it with is his signature
2782405 im a heart brea ker im a heart brea ker ooo
2782406 this victory comes as a reward to everything i have been doing and everything i have already done its for all the people who believed in me and helped me on my return
2782407 we have three goals from two games that might not sound enough but you can score 10 goals but still not qualify for the next round
2782408 so im happy with three goals and qualifying for the next round
2782409 i am very confident in my team we knew our goal and we are marching towards our goal we still need a few improvements to keep mistakes to a minimum
2782410 im going to just try to stay patient to relax
2782411 ill try to stay off my feet for a couple of hours
2782412 she even went as far to predict he will be released from hospital within a matter of weeks
2782413 the retreat was a slice of heaven for me it was so amazing you should do it every year my heart is still overflowing with joy i got to witness people get baptized that i had been praying for it gave me hope for the others that seem hopeless and it was wonderful to fellowship like that with other believers i cried and i laughed i made loving and fun new friends it was amazing i thank god for all of you for making it possible it has impacted my life tremendously
2782414 do i have to pick one favorite thing the people everyone that planned it the leaders the volunteers ken discussion leaders the band i felt so served welcomed and loved i heard people comment that this is what heaven will be like and i agree what a wonderful body in christ we have
2782415 i went in skeptical not really sure about frontline my small group i had missed a lot of church due to other commitments and i was feeling disconnected i came the message touched me challenged me the worship svcs touched me and i went home with a different point of view thank you
2782416 i love the message and the worship it is so great to be feed spiritually for a weekend i also love meeting more frontliners and the chance to hang out with old friends
2782417 i felt god was really challenging me to live a more holy life for god and not to compromise in my daily life
2782418 the teaching and worship was amazing free time was fun and relaxing i loved the bonfire and the worship on the beach
2782419 or dont you know that all of us who were baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death we were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that just as christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the father we too may live a new life
2782420 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has gone the new has come
2782421 come to me you who are weary and heavy laden and i will vacation you
2782422 why do you see the speck in your brothers eye but fail to notice the beam in your own eye or how can you say to your brother let me take the speck out of your eye when the beam is in your own eye you hypocrite first remove the beam from your own eye and then you will see clearly enough to remove the speck from your brothers eye
2782423 the human heart is most deceitful and desperately wicked who really knows how bad it is 10 but i know i the lord search all hearts and examine secret motives i give all people their due rewards according to what their actions deserve
2782424 if the righteous are barely saved what chance will the godless and sinners have
2782425 we have created a sense in modern society about hygiene that goes beyond being human
2782426 we all smell and we all sweat were supposed to
2782427 at the end of the day we want to make sure we dont stink
2782428 if youre sweating too much it cant form the plug
2782429 for the average person with healthy kidneys using antiperspirants with aluminum does not represent a safety issue
2782430 for those of us who have been around church for a while baptism can simply become something christians do
2782431 so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do it all for the glory of god
2782432 however god gets no pleasure if i make total abstinence from alcohol or other things a blanket rule to apply in every facet of life as i am also counseled by scripture that god created everything for our enjoyment
2782433 a simplistic choice to abstain from the pleasure at hand is born more out of a perceived need to follow a rule or cultural norm than a desire to honor our god and savior
2782434 my happiest hours are often spent with three or four old friends in old clothes tramping together and putting up in small pubs or else sitting up til the small hours in someones college rooms talking nonsense poetry theology metaphysics over beer tea and pipes there is no sound i like better than adult male laughter
2782435 if we study why he has created the various kinds of food we shall find that it was his intention not only to provide for our needs but likewise for our pleasure and our delight for if this were not true the psalmist would not enumerate among the divine blessings the wine that makes glad the heart of man and the oil that makes his face to shine
2782436 the selling of bad beer is a crime against christian love
2782437 give thanks to that friendly brewer for the keg of rum he sent us
2782438 when the pilgrims seeking religous freedom landed at plymouth rock the first permanent building put up was the brewery
2782439 beer is proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy
2782440 so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do all for the glory of god
2782441 that christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures that he was buried that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures
2782442 these are just some of the conditions that the new testament says we must meet in order to be saved in the fullest and final sense
2782443 if you know that he is righteous you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him
2782444 no one born of god makes a practice of sinning for gods seed abides in him and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of god
2782445 everyone who has been born of god overcomes the world and this is the victory that has overcome the world our faith
2782446 we know that everyone who has been born of god does not keep on sinning but he who was born of god protects him and the evil one does not touch him
2782447 a healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit
2782448 they could lose it if they werent a true believer
2782449 it was the first time i lost a wrestling match with a 79 year old woman
2782450 el cual jes s siendo y la imagen misma de su sustancia y quien sustenta todas las cosas con la palabra de su poder
2782451 y entonces se manifestar aquel inicuo a quien el se or matar con el esp ritu de su boca
2782452 mas yendo por el camino aconteci que al llegar cerca de damasco repentinamente
2782453 cuando a mediod a oh rey yendo por el camino
2782454 seis d as despu s jes s tom a pedro a jacobo y a juan su hermano y los llev aparte a un monte alto y resplandeci su rostro como el sol y sus vestidos se hicieron blancos como la luz
2782455 y los entendidos resplandecer n como el resplandor del firmamento y los que ense an justicia la multitud como las estrellas perpetua eternidad
2782456 alegraos con jerusal n y gozaos con ella todos los que la am is llenaos con ella de gozo todos los que os enlut is por ella
2782457 el guarda los pies de sus santos mas los imp os perecen en porque nadie ser fuerte por su fuerza
2782458 ay de ellos porque han seguido el camino de ca n y se lanzaron por lucro en el error de balaam y perecieron en la contradicci n de cor
2782459 a gente trabalhou muito a conquista n o foi obra do acaso acreditamos sempre no nosso grupo e a torcida tamb m fez o seu papel
2782460 a experi ncia muito importante nas partidas decisivas principalmente se o elenco contar com atletas que j viveram situa es semelhantes a que passamos na copa do brasil mas o importante que todos ganharam
2782461 qualquer jogador quer participar de uma competi o internacional um momento especial para cada atleta e para o clube o sport ter que trabalhar muito para montar condi es de entrar na competi o com for a e para fazer um grande papel uma grande camp
2782462 eu revejo no v deo cassete junto com meu filho e a emo o ainda a mesma dos tempos de jogador eu me lembro de tudo daquele escanteio o bet o batendo na bola eu cabeceando e aquela torcida maravilhosa gritando cara a sensa o indescrit vel
2782463 quase no finalzinho do encontro haroldo de cabe a deu a vit ria ao sport por 6x5
2782464 meu relacionamento com o sport s de alegria de vit ria e acima de tudo de muito trabalho quando se junta essas tr s coisas faz uma enorme diferen a
2782465 voc s tem que entender que o sport est na sensibilidade pl stica do mundo objetivo
2782466 a inten o fazer como foi feito na curva do dubeux com o dinheiro da venda dos camarotes bancar amos a amplia o
2782467 n o poderia aumentar a arquibancada por causa dos pr dios atr s a prefeitura n o permitiria
2782468 seria como no boca juniors la bombonera como um pr dio cheio de camarotes
2782469 ross did a good job for us we had him on trade waivers hes wasnt claimed i know there were some teams interested in him now were not heading north were heading south
2782470 det r bara socialdemokrater och annat sl dder som ker tbana dem vill vi inte ha till v r kommun
2782471 i do not believe this will have an impact on the olympic games
2782472 the goal of our organisation and of the vast majority of uighurs around the world is to peacefully resolve the problems facing uighurs in east turkistan
2782473 we advocate the principle of non violence and the promotion of freedom democracy and human rights through peaceful means we also sincerely hope for a peaceful olympic games
2782474 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshipping here in beijing china
2782475 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion

2782479 just in his tax policies alone mccain is saving corporate america 175 billion a year
2782480 theyre doing the public offering now so that the compensation can be taxed at the lower rate while bush is still in office
2782481 theyre betting obama is going to win and theyre getting their money while they can
2782482 i think we dont want to make too much of his promises on taxes
2782483 once the republicans are vanquished i wouldnt hold your breath waiting for that capital gains tax hike
2782484 in financial terms they were playing blackjack at tables where they themselves were the dealers in casinos they themselves owned
2782485 more people are involved and i think that necessarily dilutes the impact of any individual which is probably a good thing
2782486 the message is that hes going to be a friend to wall street just as bill clinton was a friend to wall street
2782487 wall street will want to be at the head of the table
2782488 they want to make sure theres socialism when they need it bailouts and capitalism when they need that
2782489 i have always been committed to the principle that it is not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly
2782490 its not an accident that both administrations picked for leading economic advisers people from goldman sachs
2782491 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2782492 i for the life of me cant imagine how that could be a proportional response to allegations that georgians had fired upon russian peacekeepers
2782493 bachelorette 4 would you describe yourself as a people person
2782494 bachelor 4 are you a cat person or a dog person
2782495 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gases is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
2782496 as of today most of the city tskhinvali is controlled by russian peacekeeping forces
2782497 our troops are in good shape there has been a very organised relocation and russia has lost 20 aircraft
2782498 they our forces have been withdrawn completely because of the heavy casualties georgia has suffered
2782499 the humanitarian situation is horrifying we have no cameras and cannot document what we can see but the morgues are busy receiving streams of dead bodies
2782500 we have fulfilled our side of the initiative the russians have not but on the contrary have increased their military presence
2782501 the russians despite the size of the forces that have entered georgia have failed to defeat our troops but we have to be realistic it is going to be very difficult to face up to them
2782502 they are state criminals who must be tried for the crimes committed in south ossetia the genocide of the ossetian people
2782503 we have received proposals for some sort of contact from the georgian side but we see yet again that they fail to grasp the meaning of what happened in the early 1990s when abkhazia and south ossetia broke away and they do not understand or do not want to understand what is going on now
2782504 the crews are assigned the task to not allow arms and military hardware supplies to reach georgia by sea
2782505 no blondes were injured during the making of this blog
2782506 hearken unto me ye that know righteousness the people in whose heart is my law fear ye not the reproach of men neither be ye afraid of their revilings for the moth shall eat them up like a garment and the worm shall eat them like wool but my righteousness shall be for ever and my salvation from generation to generation
2782507 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit who shall lay any thing to the charge of gods elect it is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us
2782508 he has showed you o man what is good and what does the lord require of you to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your god

2782510 man my ex is a pig he cheated on me 5 times why cant i get a guy who wants me for me and doesnt just want to get in my pants

2782515 die beste zeitnahe l sung um unser land aus der schwierigsten krise seiner geschichte zu befreien
2782516 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2782517 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2782518 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2782519 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2782520 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2782521 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2782522 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2782523 detroits government will the bullpens only consistent performer of late seay shines again
2782524 but im happy with the race and the time so im feeling pretty good about that
2782525 what in st paddys grave is an irish car bomb and why is a shot glass so damned important
2782526 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2782527 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2782528 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2782529 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2782530 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2782531 change just 5 of your light bulbs to cfl or led light bulbs
2782532 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2782533 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2782534 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2782535 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2782536 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2782537 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2782538 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2782539 okay so im going to be a raging fathead and cut out all forms of fun out of my life staring with mini golf
2782540 sei arrivato da solo qualche anno fa a chiedere se potevi giocare da noi mi avevi conquistato subito con quel tuo sorriso sincero dolce e penetrante ti sei poi ripresentato con i tuoi genitori tuoi primi tifosi e sostenitori sempre presenti a tutte le tue partite e agli allenamenti volevi presentarmeli a tutti i costi hai cominciato in una squadra pi grande di te ancora non avevamo la tua categoria ma con la tua personalit volont ed impegno hai conquistato via via il tuo posto ti sei aggiudicato addirittura il ruolo di capitano hai guidato la tua squadra alla vittoria finale nel tuo campionato hai alzato la coppa come solo pochi sanno fare alla tua et la tua tenacia e la tua volont ti hanno fatto scendere in campo anche quando i tuoi problemi fisici non te lo permettevano ma tu capitano eri sempre l ad aiutarci e a spronarci ci hai reso felici ci riempivi di orgoglio ci guardavi sempre in tribuna ad ogni tuo goal facevi sempre locchiolino ai tuoi genitori come a dire fieri di me lo eravamo tutti lo saremo sempre ora per te ne sei andato nostro signore ti ha voluto a se come angelo del celo ma ci ha lasciato un vuoto incolmabile un dolore straziante il cuore spezzato sarai adesso il nostro angelo la nostra guida veglierai su di noi sulla tua famiglia aiutaci a sopportare il dolore le paure e quella sensazione di vuoto che tutti noi fortunati per averti conosciuto portiamo dentro non ti dimenticher mai piccolo licio perch davvero sei stato per me pi di qualsiasi altro quel modello di figlio che ho sempre immaginato e che auguro a qualsiasi genitore di poter avere ti abbraccio fortissimo ti riempio di baci stacci vicino mattia stacci vicino ora pi che mai e per sempre ti voglio bene piccolo angelo
2782541 hey right here points around ad bc mark is now should be a good spot to start we dont have to count that high and since we only have real proof of things 600 years the other way we can just have it open ended for later
2782542 all unconventional forms of oil are worse for greenhouse gas emissions than petroleum
2782543 and its pretty easy to understand why its not so hard to turn liquid petroleum into liquid fuels turning a solid material like coal into a liquid it sounds hard to do and it is hard to do and that extra effort shows up in higher energy consumption and higher water use and higher emissions
2782544 youre talking about nearly doubling the greenhouse gas emissions think about talking about a world in which over all greenhouse gas emissions should start to go down and this is a technology that doubles emissions they dont go together too well do they
2782545 the environment and climate change are what are called externalities
2782546 and at the moment we dont have effective ways of including these externalities in market transactions of any sort
2782547 if companies could lay off the risk of oil prices dropping below forty dollars a barrel there would be enormous investment in this
2782548 but when policies are proposed to promote c t l i think the question to ask is is this an industry we want to start now
2782549 a lot of the fish are getting i might as well say it scabby
2782550 i dont know what we have to do to try to prevent them from destroying any more
2782551 they try to say they can clean it theres no way itll take a thousand years before it flushes itself out and i think ill be too damn old for that
2782552 there is no environmental minister on earth who can stop the oil from coming out of the sand because the money is too big
2782553 no one means to demean the academic successes of barack obama or the schools he attended
2782554 the rnc and this campaign have sought to simply point out that on his hawaii travels there are certain landmarks reporters will likely see and this was a way to put those on the map
2782555 rambunctious boy with a little bit of a chip on my shoulder
2782556 the self restraint and mellowness i developed as an adult
2782557 while john mccain went to private school he also went to public university
2782558 all children should have a teacher like i had who they remember when they have children and grandchildren as one of the most fortunate relationships in their lives
2782559 its good for the world to have girls playing softball and these women are going to show young girls how to win
2782560 these women are going to show young girls how to win
2782561 stai scrivendo una storia che capitata a noi e che magari parla di me
2782562 e vero sto scrivendo qualcosa di te tuttavia pi importante delle parole la matita con la quale scrivo vorrei la usassi tu quando sarai cresciuto
2782563 ma uguale a tutte le altre matite che ho visto nella mia vita
2782564 dipende tutto dal modo in cui guardi le cose questa matita possiede cinque qualit se riuscirai a trasporle nellesistenza sarai sempre una persona in pace con il mondo
2782565 look mommy i mixed up the sparkles to make some really pretty sparkles
2782566 gee this dark on the ouside with the light color mohawk is fucking tits
2782567 an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia
2782568 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war
2782569 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia
2782570 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereign has encroached on georgias sovereignty and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible
2782571 clearly over the course of the last 24 hours this crisis has escalated
2782572 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2782573 in the middle of an international crisis in which people are getting killed
2782574 the best the obama campaign can come up with is to cast aspersions on a mccain staffer
2782575 has been involved in the efforts of former soviet republics to embrace democracy and free market values since the end of the cold war
2782576 if you dont take risks and are concentrating on those core roles that have an executive at his or her desk all day you might be missing some good business opportunities
2782577 although the chinese have been capable of disrupting groups operating inside the country these new attackers are trained and equipped outside and come into china to carry out operations this is a new capability that chinese security forces have to deal with and they are finding it difficult
2782578 que la ganancia industrial petrolera quede en pemex cerca de 200 millones de pesos en ganancias una reforma en presupuesto que permita a la empresa usar sus ganancias acabar con los pidiregas y que el gobierno federal tenga que financiar su d fict como lo hace cualquier gobierno del mundo que no es a costa de sus paraestatales sino reduciendo gastos recaudando mejor fonde ndose en el mercado y emitiendo bonos
2782579 supongo que desde el punto de vista moral moderno es decir cristiano la corrida es moralmente indefendible hay siempre en ella crueldad peligro buscado o azaroso y muerte
2782580 no estar a mal tener un libro en ingl s sobre las corridas de toros un libro serio sobre un asunto tan poco moral puede tener siempre inter s
2782581 yo he visto todo eso la gente corriendo el caballo destrip ndose y los elementos de su dignidad pereciendo uno tras otro a medida que el animal se destripaba arrastrando por el suelo sus porciones m s ntimas en una parodia de tragedia
2782582 los dos gitanos estaban en el matadero entonces y el muchacho pidi permiso puesto que el toro hab a matado a su hermano para matarlo l mismo se le concedi y empez por arrancarle los ojos cuando el toro estaba en la jaula luego le escupi cuidadosamente en las rbitas lo mat despu s meti ndole un pu al en la espina dorsal entre las v rtebras del cuello
2782583 cuando uno de los caballos fue herido sali de su vientre una lluvia de serr n el serr n fue metido en el cuerpo del caballo para llenar el vac o creado por la p rdida de varios rganos
2782584 de todos los asuntos de dinero que conozco no he visto nada m s sucio que las corridas de toros
2782585 pero en general no hay hombre m s mezquino con sus inferiores que el torero
2782586 los toreros pueden sentir miedo del toro y si sienten ese temor mandan a los picadores y a los banderilleros que lo revienten
2782587 si vais con alguien que est realmente bien informado de las corridas y si quereis entenderlas y aprender siempre que los detalles no os repugnen los mejores asientos son en primer lugar la barrera
2782588 tampoco voy a hacer una apolog a de la fiesta de los toros es una supervivencia de la poca del circo romano pero es necesario explicar una cuesti n la tauromaquia no es un deporte nunca lo fue sino una tragedia la gran tragedia de la muerte del toro que se representa en tres actos
2782589 jo no va a z curtura zi lorca jeminguai y er golla lo uzaba pa zu arte
2782590 ver hacer un hijo a una mujer es para m tomar posesi n y esto me ayuda a matar los sentimientos que pudieran existir
2782591 our experiences tell us that environmental stress due to lack of water may lead to conflict and would be greater in poor nations
2782592 population growth will make the problem worse so will climate change as the global economy grows so will its thirst many more conflicts lie just over the horizon
2782593 the greatest challenge we face is to try and reduce the dependence on the import of grains whether by increasing local production or whether by making more efficient use of raw materials in feeding livestock
2782594 this must be done despite all limitations mainly the lack of water
2782595 if the desalination and recycling projects are implemented a lack of water is not expected in 2013
2782596 i dont even like to go there its a disaster
2782597 we just threw everything to the floor and hope that next year is better
2782598 the decision is really simple you choose the part of your fields that are hardest to get water to and you destroy them
2782599 can shine or they can look to be out of touch or inconsiderate of the suffering of others
2782600 one of the other ways they can show they care is with the taxpayers checkbook theyre quick to open it especially when it gets into the papers or cable news
2782601 as far as the politics go certainly as the president found out there are good ways to handle disasters and bad ways to handle disasters
2782602 which suggests that presidents are trying to keep citizens happy in the years they are running for re election
2782603 the general sense is that you cant peg any particular weather event to climate change but everything were seeing is consistent with what the models predict
2782604 what were able to do today is to take a look at some events and to see if they would have occurred either as frequently or as extreme if it werent for human changes to the atmospheric composition
2782605 what characteristics are needed to be an effective leader today
2782606 so this one pussy says to the other pussy insert derisive banter here
2782607 youre telling e that my daughter is coming out of the closet
2782608 what would motivate me to participate in this program or buy this product
2782609 s ince the day i discovered taken in hand is a necessary read very complex lots of power shifts combining respect with pain and pleasure domination roles submissive roles the whole shebang im glad i found it
2782610 first of all all you guys should check out this website articles very valuable insights im taken by this site
2782611 u ntil 2 days ago i thought i was a crazy abnormal taken in hand website i have never felt such relief such internal peace in my life this whole idea of being loved and trusting enough in another to place my his and our well being into his hands was exactly what i have been searching for my whole life i spent 16 hours just reading it is like a huge weight has lifted off my shoulders
2782612 there are lots of websites for people in the bdsm d s dd domestic discipline and spanking communities there are websites for people who belong to religions that advocate male head of household marriage there are even websites for christians who are interested in bdsm but there are very few websites for people who are interested in male led intimate relationships but who are not interested in all that the above communities associate with this kind of relationship jargon clothes etc some of us dont even like thinking of this as a lifestyle if you are interested in this kind of relationship but are not interested in bdsm or d s or dd or spanking websites theres a new website for you taken in hand is really the most beautiful website devoted to dd
2782613 t he whole damn site really is one of the most well articulated pro con loaded blogs ive seen it provides a cross section of how people are feeling out there even amongst those who are seemingly natural allies
2782614 as i view it im a control freak i love to be in control however i fantasize about that control being stripped from me and handed over to someone else namely my husband im just glad i found a site that makes me realize im not a freak for wanting to be dominated
2782615 thank you for providing such a positive validating place for like minded people to talk about this in a way that affirms the dignity of both men and women
2782616 i want a man that can put his foot down
2782617 sitting there watching michael phelps set a world record was special because it made me realise how many people are inspired by him
2782618 now im in the position to have that opportunity to go out there and get a medal for my country today was hopefully the first step towards that
2782619 individual contributor roles are just more and more prevalent and more and more valued by companies
2782620 youre not going to be fighting tooth and nail to get the recognition thats comparable
2782621 it sent a very clear message by saying weve had
2782622 what i have noticed is that the new signings have adapted really quickly it seems as though theyve been with us for ages
2782623 this is good as in football you need team work and the more we are united the better
2782624 but i imagine it would have been one of frustration
2782625 it looked like it should have been a penalty from where i was if a player doesnt get the decision that he wants then the emotion of the game and the importance of it means they are going to react
2782626 we cant take that human element out of football its just a case of keeping the reaction under control i think hes probably been our most exciting player in pre season hes been fantastic throughout all the games
2782627 today he caused portsmouth a lot of problems and maybe could have had one or two goals he was deservedly the match sponsors man of the match
2782628 as for me it was fantastic just to get a game a competitive game under my belt its probably the most prestigious pre season game you can play in after being out for so long i was just happy being out there with the lads and being part of it again
2782629 taking the 90 minutes into consideration it was a good workout for us
2782630 it would have been nice to win but we look forward to next sunday chelsea at stamford bridge with a lot of confidence
2782631 there are a significant number of vendors who have mounting pressure on them to meet the market as mortgage repayments on top of increased costs of living start to bite
2782632 this change of position reflects a greater understanding and acceptance of the property market and the wider economy
2782633 there are many examples of significant losses being realised currently
2782634 because of the sheer volume that is on the market the people who want to sell quicker need to drop their prices to be more competitive
2782635 the ones that are most motivated will drop the most so there are some good buys out there
2782636 ive just sold a home for about 50 000 less i sold it for 492 000 last year
2782637 anybody that doesnt need to sell is probably not in this market i would say
2782638 paul didnt want to die in the hospital joanne and their daughters are beside themselves with grief
2782639 he gave a prized car a ferrari with his racing number 82 on it to a long time pal the sudden move angered his children its especially hard for them to come to grips with whats going on
2782640 the word theyve been given is that he has only a few weeks to live
2782641 we knew six months ago the market was starting to ease in a lot of places so it is a confirmation of that anecdotal evidence
2782642 dated properties leaky homes and properties with overgrown sections are noticeably affected
2782643 the question has now changed from when will prices stop rising to when can we expect to see them stabilise
2782644 it has had a doubling in the past five years so it might sit quietly for five years and away well go again
2782645 does anyone believe that it is possible to win the nomination without over these next two months raising all these issues on him wont a single tape of the reverend jeremiah wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
2782646 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
2782647 the main source of support for the u s economy in recent quarters has been the strength of net exports
2782648 but the world economy has fallen off the edge of a cliff
2782649 they were always the hometown airline they were in the downtown parades they invested in the community
2782650 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2782651 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts
2782652 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about
2782653 the more you raise fees the more you drive airlines and customers away
2782654 its rhetoric ive heard for 41 years but i understand
2782655 these folks arent sure if theyre going to be in business in six months
2782656 on the other hand airports are very dependent on the airlines bringing passengers
2782657 jewish georgian minister temur yakobshvili on sunday praised the israel defense forces for its role in training georgian troops and said israel should be proud of its military might in an interview with army radio
2782658 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers

2782662 i am pleased with the race the way the race panned out we had to keep an eye on the opposition and we did that and i am happy
2782663 it was close at the end but we pulled through strongly we had a very good start and we came through when we needed to
2782664 i feel there were two points in the race where other teams could have made a move but they didnt and i always felt confident that we had more in the tank
2782665 winning our heat was important i felt we put down a marker for the opposition because they are going to look at us now as a heat winner and that is a very good thing
2782666 winning the heat will also help our semi final seedings which is also important
2782667 times dont matter in this sport we have been in this game a long time and the winner of the gold medal doesnt always have the quickest heat time
2782668 i think the way the competitions are at this regatta you just dont know what is going to happen

2782672 training with the french air force provided us the invaluable opportunity to learn from each others operational experience improve our combat skills and strengthen the bond of friendship between our great air forces and our great countries
2782673 the french visit provided an excellent opportunity to strengthen our social relationship and enhance future relations
2782674 there should be as many combined operations as possible before there are lessons learned in combat
2782675 the cooperation between france and the u s goes all the way back to world war i

2782690 the liberal partys green shift announced on june 19th marked the most aggressive anti poverty program in 40 years the shift will transfer wealth from rich to poor from the oil patch to the rest of the country and from the coffers of big business to the pockets of low income canadians
2782691 to understand why investors are so touchy perhaps its best to hear how ontario liberal mp ken boshcoff initially sold the green shift plan to his constituents in thunder bay rainy river
2782692 the liberal partys green shift announced on june 19 marked the most aggressive anti poverty program in 40 years
2782693 the shift will transfer wealth from rich to poor from the oilpatch to the rest of the country and from the coffers of big business to the pockets of low income canadians
2782694 the oilpatch boshcoff is referring to obviously is in alberta where very few people vote liberal
2782695 the project managed to show how trusting the local law enforcement agencies really were
2782696 thirty eight years after joni mitchell penned her lyrics about paving over paradise with a parking lot two dozen summer interns gathered by planning and design firm edaw have helped plan a landscaped park over the mother of all parking lots

2782699 dumnezeu cel vesnic si atotputernic se face si om ramanand insa si dumnezeu
2782700 atat de mult a iubit dumnezeu lumea incat pe fiul sau cel unul nascut l a dat pentru ca tot cel ce crede in el sa nu piara ci sa aiba viata vesnica
2782701 i corinteni xv 14 spune sf ap pavel cu alte cuvinte daca mantuitorul n a inviat atunci orice invatatura a
2782702 luati duh sfant carora veti ierta pacatele iertate vor fi si carora le veti tine tinute vor fi

2782704 caci tot cel ce se inalta pe sine se va smeri iar cel ce se smereste pe sine se va inalta
2782705 employer sanctions is the one that pushed them over the top
2782706 he votado para que se quede este presidente y tengamos un pa s digno y para que se vayan si es posible todos los prefectos as tal vez mis hijos no sean limosneros y puedan tener trabajo
2782707 apoy al evo porque es de nuestra sangre y estamos viendo el cambio que muchos presidentes no han hecho como las nacionalizaciones debemos darle la oportunidad de que siga

2782710 senior u s military official says the americans have begun flying georgian troops home from iraq after they requested help with transportation

2782712 aqui a arte n o os ensina apenas a serem artistas aprendem sobre disciplina sobre tica sobre cidadania sobre auto estima sobre dignidade sobre est tica sobre bons modos
2782713 i want to know what it feels like to stand up on stage facing so many people who will be watching what you say and every move you make
2782714 that way ill get to know new faces as socialising is my big time hobby
2782715 hibiscus brings together people and is an occasion we all want to attend for as long as it lasts
2782716 this is just a bully boy tactic to intimidate her
2782717 in a state of pregnancy a woman is entitled to rest and be in an environment which is peaceful to her state of mind and that of her baby
2782718 so he obviously knows something and would be the most obvious person to question instead they go for the weakest person who is pregnant and question her for hours
2782719 when we come to resolving all our problems and democracy is returned we must take each and every police and military person to task who carried out an order they felt was wrong because they remained silent and carried out the job anyway they let people down and they should not be allowed to hide the i was doing my job or following orders excuse
2782720 their concern should always be the welfare of the people
2782721 is this an example of the good governance and personal security the peoples charter is talking about
2782722 now we are looking at the yellow ribbon project and the rehabilitation of prisoners
2782723 it is also the vital means for the modernisation of fiji to slowly emerging from a feudal and colonial experience
2782724 it cultivates self awareness so essential to our place in the modern world and commits us to the institutions of a genuinely civil society
2782725 it makes us see our society in a new light it transforms us from subjects to citizens of a nation
2782726 it is the noblest and lasting legacy of our forefathers and our fathers and mothers
2782727 it is said that the price of education is high but the price of ignorance is much higher
2782728 despite many problems the fiji community has continued to educate its children and others from the region
2782729 we hope to make it to the top place again this year
2782730 last year when we came in second i was happy because we came thirteenth in nausori in 2006 and that was the only time
2782731 we have always been among the top five in the class one category for the church choir
2782732 we will perform to our best and let the lord do the rest
2782733 the sunday school will sing sa bula noqu kalou which says if you have jesus in your life you will not be afraid of what comes your way
2782734 the church choir will sing a hymn called na vuku ni kalou and thats based on job 28 where job searches for wisdom but god tells him that fear of god is wisdom and turning away from evil is understanding
2782735 ive composed these hymns taught their choir leaders who then take it to their people
2782736 the nadawa choir is my highlight because it is my home choir
2782737 i dont think police has any reason to talk to me
2782738 i am very surprised that they took serafina in for questioning and for what
2782739 what is seditious about my comments that were published in the media
2782740 i have no fear of the intern finance minister mahendra chaudhry he has ruined the country and the farmers are suffering
2782741 i am prepared to take on chaudhrys job and bring the country back on its feet
2782742 i was told that the letter was given to him by mr bainimarama before the government team left for china for the olympic games and the letter states that he has until august 22 to clear himself from public office and that will be in the next two weeks
2782743 this means he wont attend the next cabinet meeting on august 22 and i challenge mahen to tell the people that his job is on the line
2782744 the interim finance minister made a commitment saying the taxi fare increase was due and he said he would bring it up at the cabinet meeting
2782745 fuel is a substantial cost to the operations so i can understand their concerns
2782746 im surprised that they have not been assisted in terms of getting industry information because most of the members are individual owners and as such do not have the resources to provide professional information
2782747 breastfeeding does not come naturally but has to be taught
2782748 there has been a tendency among working mothers especially to refrain from breastfeeding their babies at an early stage
2782749 breastfeeding can reduce the number of deaths caused by acute respiratory infection and diarrhoea two major child killers as well as from other infectious diseases
2782750 it also contributes to the health of others and creates a bond between the mother and child
2782751 although i have declined to award indemnity costs in the present application this does not mean that another judge might not be so inclined to do in a similar matter depending upon the facts before them
2782752 when people are faced with all these challenges they sometimes cannot cope and this leads to social ills like depression broken marriages and alcoholism
2782753 recently a multi racial group of concerned citizens of nadroga formed the nadroga navosa counselling centre
2782754 we have 10 members made up of pastors teachers and medical professionals and provide counselling services to those who approach us
2782755 we are using water from a nearby residents home and we pay 10 fortnightly
2782756 we cant even extend and build a proper house yet because officials keep telling us to move from one place to another
2782757 last year we had the same target but collected only 1300
2782758 this year i dont think we will collect as much because the crowd is not as much as last year
2782759 from july to october we carry out street appeals send out letters to post office box holders and cash tins to schools in suva
2782760 last year we collected 55 000 and our target this year is 60 000
2782761 we have 27 boarders from the western division outer islands and one regional student
2782762 the hostel is for students who cannot come for daily classes lodgings meals and stationery are free
2782763 through adequate leadership attention and resources improvements can be made
2782764 at the moment there are very little incentives to assist doctors with the stressful working environments in hospitals
2782765 for these reasons the plaintiff continues to be psychologically disturbed and refuses to socialise and interact with children or attend school whereby his social physical and mental well being is being affected
2782766 people need to know that god still answers prayers and if theres anything you need take it to the lord and hell provide for you
2782767 one day mr sadiq called and asked if the home needed anything
2782768 i said we needed a hall to accommodate visitors and sure enough he came with the money
2782769 well when i was in the can i wrote to my wife
2782770 i told her that i was going to be away a long time and that if she couldnt stand it if the kids kept askin questions if it hurt too much well she could just forget me id understand get a new guy i said shes a wonderful woman really something and forget about me i told her she didnt have to write me or nothing and she didnt not for three and a half years
2782771 well last week when i was sure the parole was coming through i wrote her again we used to live in brunswick just before jacksonville and theres a big oak tree just as you come into town i told her that if shed take me back she should put a yellow handkerchief on the tree and id get off and come home if she didnt want me forget it no handkerchief and id go through
2782772 there are rehabilitation programs in place to prepare prisoners when they are released
2782773 this is so that when he or she walks out they dont face a culture shock
2782774 a worthy objective for fiji stakeholders is to adapt the yrp into the fiji situation and ultimately evolve and transform it into something that is identifiably fijian in the national identity sense
2782775 new zealand law does not allow names that would cause offense to a reasonable person that are 100 characters or more long that include titles or military rank or that include punctuation marks or numerals
2782776 as a black man i have to admit that it was strange to watch and listen to senator obama as he tried to assure white folks that he is not a racist and does not intend to hold them accountable for the plight of the black community
2782777 it is ironic that a black man has to convince white people that the blame of the damage that 300 years of slavery segregation and oppression has done will not be laid at their door
2782778 well senator obama is a politician and we all know that politicians and truth are very often strangers to one another but to many of us in the black community the rev jeremiah a wright got it right
2782779 they denounced kings critical comments today they simply silence them
2782780 much more significant and much more revealing than any of wrights comments themselves
2782781 views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation that rightly offend white and black alike
2782782 a profoundly distorted view of this country a view that sees white racism as endemic
2782783 elevate what is wrong with america above all that we know is right with america
2782784 i have already condemned in unequivocal terms the statements of reverend wright that have caused such controversy
2782785 a view that sees the conflicts in the middle east as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like israel instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical islam
2782786 imported honey goes through required international standard processes they sell at a lower price than local honey which do not go through such process
2782787 there is only one bee company that goes through the standard process and it is based in rakiraki
2782788 when we fall in love were just falling in love with ourselves
2782789 ryan whats the easiest thing to do in the whole world
2782790 i can take care of this i can fix this im a big boy
2782791 put the lord your god first and then everything else will follow
2782792 a start for what we hope will be a continuing and lively conversation
2782793 penso che sapersi accontentare delle piccole cose crogiolarsi nelle sensazioni di piacere e dolcezza che ti possono dare sia una delle cose fondamentali da ricordarsi durante la ricerca non dico della felicit ma almeno di un equilibrio stabile
2782794 ok detto questo posso ritirarmi colmo di odio verso il mondo per cercare un pochinino di refrigerio
2782795 mi faccio le sorprese da solo 1 ma lo faro sar un prequel ma veniamo ai fatti di stamattina

2782800 ottimo ho trovato qualcosa da fare mentre ascolto la musica
2782801 ma dov che ascoltavo i cd a tutto volume prima di andare a biarritz
2782802 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
2782803 i have a thousand gods if one of my gods fail i turn to another if your god fails what do you do
2782804 you told me that you are king in this place and that if you found me here again you would shoot me i told you that i served the lord jesus that he is my king and he has not told me to leave this place i must remain until he tells me to go you can shoot me if you wish but first let me tell you about the one true god because he loves you
2782805 i entered that prayer hall at 10 30 in the morning and when i came out at 4 30 in the afternoon i came out a new man
2782806 is the power of god unto salvation to every one who believes
2782807 no today is the very first time in my life that i have been in my right mind that brandy has been poison to me and i will not allow it to be a poison to others
2782808 i can truly say that i have been washed in my fathers own blood
2782809 the shoe shine boy which is available from the people who gve you this booklet
2782810 you are the servant of the almighty god and yet you need a bodyguard
2782811 the wages of sin is death that is all that you can earn but the gift of god is eternal life throughjesus christ our lord
2782812 although shes always said she was happy to go with the flow rachel must like any woman with a younger man worry whether hell stick around
2782813 she was ridiculed for putting on weight doing her celebrity circus tv show and thats pretty much a new thing for her which again will make her look for security in her relationship with jarret she plans to show him some of her favourite beaches even though its winter and go for some real luxury hideaways
2782814 the kids have no troubles with jarret liam now has a first class ice hockey coach so hes happy obviously as a single mother you have to treat new relationships very delicately
2782815 that may be the case i dont think they will be talking about the wedding for a while when rachels ready to announce shes engaged i am sure she will do it
2782816 he translated the pain of the palestinians in a magical way he made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions
2782817 apart from being the poet of the palestinian wound which is hurting all arabs and all honest people in the world he is a master poet
2782818 this great figure whose poetry which reflects nostalgia and liberty speaks to us all
2782819 mahmoud darwish knew how to express the attachment of an entire people to its land and the absolute desire for peace his message which calls for coexistence will continue to resonate and will eventually be heard
2782820 the palestinian question in mahmoud darwishs poetry was no longer a legend but the story of people made of flesh blood and feelings
2782821 the voice of palestinian civilisation with its pains sadness and ambitions
2782822 he turned the palestinian cause into songs that transcended the cause and all other arab issues
2782823 today i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighters gun do not let the olive branch fall from my hand
2782824 nabucco all skirt repertory at this point i can only speak for the suit but hot damn
2782825 were trying to energize who we have out there but a lot of young people arent going to vote
2782826 it seems like every couple of years they say its going to be the year of the youth vote and it hasnt been yet
2782827 id like to think people are more civilly engaged but its really that voter participation was so low that it had nowhere to go but up
2782828 to be honest id rather the president not spend his time e mailing

2782880 people who are saying president musharraf will resign they are either lying or they simply dont know his nature

2782882 i think for full restoration of the constitution and for the survival of this nation and for democracy in this country it is very necessary that gen musharraf resigns himself otherwise the impeachment will start

2782923 georgia quiere recuperar su territorio y est en su derecho
2782924 sta es una agresi n del lado ruso ellos bombardearon nuestra tierra
2782925 a la gente le gusta sus declaraciones contundentes y la mayor a est de su lado incluso la oposici n
2782926 esto es un infierno es un desastre pero tenemos que luchar hasta el final para que rusia aprenda la lecci n de que no puede actuar de este modo en el siglo xxi incluso aunque todos tengamos que morir
2782927 mucha gente no entiende por qu el mundo occidental no nos protegi
2782928 ee uu es visto como un aliado y muchos soldados georgianos han muerto en irak en nombre de la seguridad global pero occidente demostr que no le importa si rusia invade otros pa ses
2782929 todo lo que han hecho es expresar su preocupaci n mientras las bombas nos ca an encima

2782935 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2782936 the response was that all hybrids would be shipped from the factory with the decals
2782937 the very purpose of these attacks is all about separating the region from china
2782938 want to use the olympic stage to enlarge the impact
2782939 one of the first things the falling gasoline price does is potentially help consumer confidence
2782940 even though prices are still high if they are going in the right direction that helps a little bit
2782941 we expect that a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire will be introduced shortly
2782942 to take urgent action calling for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of all forces to the status quo
2782943 actually impeding the withdrawal of georgian forces from south ossetia
2782944 this is an unsconscionable effort to continue the conflict and prevent the georgians from taking concrete steps to de escalate the situation
2782945 we condemn the russian attack on the sovereign of georgia
2782946 to consider the implications of this aggression against the sovereign and democratic state of georgia
2782947 russias relations with the united states and others would be affected by its continued assault on georgia and its refusal to contribute to a peaceful conclusion of the crisis
2782948 this is totally untrue we did not send any apology
2782949 this is totally untrue we did not send any apology
2782950 is run by lobbyists that represent georgia and other countries
2782951 he takes huge amounts of money from oil companies that are profiting in the former soviet union and many parts of the world
2782952 this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory
2782953 experience is only positive insofar as it creates good judgment
2782954 and i think senator obamas strong case to the american people is that he will have the right judgment about how to balance americas military force with strong diplomacy to protect our interests abroad
2782955 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2782956 mr scheunemann proudly represented a small democracy that is one of our closest allies in a very dangerous region
2782957 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them
2782958 theyre an example of senator mccains push to spread democracy in that part of the world as a very important advance of americas interest as well as being good for international stability
2782959 so instead of trying to detract from the central issue i wish senator obama had actually confronted the issue not trying to detract our attention by focusing on a mccain adviser
2782960 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got these cold chills
2782961 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2782962 i was very nervous today as its been very difficult for my people
2782963 it was nice of natalia to come up to me afterwards and give me an embrace
2782964 sometimes i felt like i was drowning more or less coming down the climb the first time i was just freezing and i couldnt stop shaking
2782965 at this point i think it is reasonable to say that tomorrow probably will come and go without that happening
2782966 we need to have a strong verification regime before we can take action on removing the north koreans from the state sponsors of terrorism list
2782967 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2782968 we do not plan to escalate the conflict in this region
2782969 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals
2782970 were being driven away the place was in flames and we couldnt stay
2782971 this reminds me all too much of other recent conflicts that have torn our continent apart particularly in the balkans

2782978 i was recently canvassing door to door in luttrell park where one of the main issues that was raised with me was the disruption caused by large volumes of commuter parking occurring within the estate residents described to me the difficulties that this caused bin lorries unable to make pick ups and more seriously ambulances unable to access certain parts of the estate
2782979 i made representations to fingal county council on this issue specifically stating that single yellow lines should be implemented in a number of locations to ensure that at least one side of the major access roads would be kept car free
2782980 i am pleased to say there has been some admittedly small progress on these issues the transportation dept of fingal county council have contacted me to say that they will be implementing a single yellow line along the west side of luttrel park drive from the main road to the junction with luttrell park close
2782981 while this development is welcome i do not believe that it goes far enough to deal with the parking issues currently being experienced however fingal county council have committed to keeping the issue under review and i will continue to lobby the council on the issue of commuter parking in the estate particularly in light of the new charges being implemented at coolmine station
2782982 how to copy previously recorded programs from a sa pvr to a dvd recorder or something similar
2782983 once and for all the media center team the tv team and the extender team yes it would have been a co ordinated dev effort from all three teams did not implement streaming of dvds from pcs or changers for one big reason getting core functionality working on vista was hard enough and if like me youre running an early build of vista on you will understand
2782984 and without doubt had there been extra time in the schedule there were many features of higher importance ahead of dvd streaming dvd streaming is actually quite close to the bottom
2782985 i know all you with changers wanted it though im puzzled why you bought the changer in the first place just get a fat nas but theres not enough of you and dont get all chicken and egg on me you still wouldnt have bought a changer if we had the feature youd get a fat nas
2782986 i played real hard to be mediocre and i was fortunate when hank offered me the coaching job i was single and living out of my car so i gave it a try to see what happened
2782987 the players are the one thing that keeps you coming back and thats because we have good players the braves always get guys who are good people with strong work ethics and great makeup they have the intangibles that make them the best players they can be and thats what makes it fun to go to work everyday
2782988 its my job to hold things together and keep the best possible team on the field every day
2782989 you should expect your team to win winning needs to be a priority at this level results need to be a priority youve got to have results to show you can play in the big leagues pitchers need to win games and hitters need to produce in key situations

2783053 people who are saying president musharraf will resign they are either lying or they simply dont know his nature

2783056 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
2783057 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2783058 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
2783059 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
2783060 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age

2783112 the most important part of the assessment is not the number that drops out at the end of the assessment but the answers to the probing questions prompted by the maturity model the greatest benefit from the assessment comes from the genuine discussions amongst the key stakeholders in response to the assessment questions about what is important and what is being achieved and missed in many instances a light will turn on signaling a change in direction for the better

2783126 find them bring them in grow them up and send them out
2783127 next generation computing products from dell met our requirements and all it solutions price performance and total cost of ownership tco were key factors in determining our choice and we were also convinced about the capabilities of emirates computers who have done a good job with the delivery and installation
2783128 this is a prestigious project for us we are happy to deploy high performing and competitively priced dell products aligned with committed support from our end these solutions provide an optimal solution that address scalable requirements of the departments environment we are confident that more public sector departments will follow suit in installing top of the line business grade it solutions
2783129 lack of knowledge and uncertainty are swept under the rug colorful diagrams which mean nothing to economists are presented as clear evidence to me they look like a marketing gimmick like those used to sell a new product in the supermarket
2783130 a year ago i challenged several ardent supporters of neuroeconomics to show me even one neuroeconomics paper that is likely to change economics i have yet to receive a satisfactory response
2783131 the grand vision of neuroeconomics is to use the additional information obtained from brain studies combined with the choice made by the decision maker in order to better understand the deliberation process and to use the results to improve economic models however it is far from being clear if and how this can be accomplished
2783132 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2783133 the talks are still ongoing theres been a great deal of progress the deal is very close it is about to be closed
2783134 our negotiators have really found compromises on all these issues
2783135 you may hear many dates but i caution you not to take any of these dates until you get the final document
2783136 why are you doing this you dont really think thats going to make a difference do you
2783137 i signed a pledge to let the olympic sponsors know that what they are allowing in darfur is not okay
2783138 i am going to take this time when the commercials are playing to learn about how i can help stop the tragedies in darfur
2783139 why dont you switch over with me lets watch mia farrows broadcasts together and think about what we can do to help
2783140 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
2783141 i have a coworker who recently picked up an xbox 360 i had been ranting about how good geometry wars 2 was so he downloaded it a few days later when i was over at his house he beat my high score on the first run
2783142 nowadays hes the mvp hes a little like michael jordan
2783143 more good chinese players are in the nba like yao ming and new jersey nets power forward yi jianlian chinese people feel so proud of them
2783144 on the other hand some nba stars such as kobe bryant and tracy mcgrady are really popular with chinese people and have plenty of fans in china
2783145 and the way they seem to have fun when they are playing
2783146 the attitude of the players is a really big attraction
2783147 most fans just want to support a wonderful match just want to be a pure fan and watch the game even if the fan supports the chinese team he will applaud the excellent u s team performance

2783154 im not sure i could have picked a tougher cycle to be chairman of the nrsc
2783155 we do not have a single democratic incumbent who has any trouble at all
2783156 were in great shape there are 11 republicans that have races that they should be worried about and they are worried about them
2783157 he didnt particularly want the job he gets credit for stepping up to the plate and taking on something that nobody wanted nobody blames him for the environment
2783158 i appealed to their patriotism thats why i ran you want people who are running for the right reason
2783159 it cant be a lot of fun most of the news has been bad certainly its been a challenging political environment
2783160 if we only lose two or three its still a phenomenal night
2783161 its difficult to get to 60 because of the map
2783162 the more numbers we can keep in the senate the more bad legislation we can stop
2783163 we can make the majority moderate we can make them less extreme they just cant run you over not if you stay together thats why you need 41 strong votes
2783164 its tougher chuck schumer has new york city in his back yard
2783165 we are actually raising more money in other parts of the country but new york more than makes up for that
2783166 his colleagues know when the chips were down he agreed to take on this formidable thankless job
2783167 what are the wider implications the conflict could widen to bring in other soviet republics the us and europe the root of the problem is that the international community cannot agree on rules for the independence of small regions russia said that granting independence to kosovo would set a dangerous precedent moscow now seems determined to prove it was right all along
2783168 religion is regarded by the common people as true by the wise as false and by the ruler as useful
2783169 narrative games are barely past the infant stage and critical commentary and analysis about them are even less developed
2783170 everyone is still trying to figure out who everyone else is and in this process communities form themselves we are on the ground floor of this effort to try to figure out how to talk intelligently about video games how to analyze them and develop a critical language to discuss them were not like other disciplines im not even sure i would call us a discipline yet because were all figuring this out together we dont even have the terms yet
2783171 part of our trepidation about what to call it is that there is already a field called game studies and some of us arent comfortable with where thats going or dont feel we quite fit in there
2783172 my hobbies include well coding and uhm thats about it
2783173 i was overwhelmed with joy listening to my peers talk back and forth in rapid yiddish while i did not comprehend them completely i did understand a lot more than i thought i was and i followed their conversation from topic to topic it was great to hear yiddish being sprinkled with the occasional english word rather than the other way around

2783185 i think a big draw is the just the environmental aspect

2783195 coach fox and general manager marty hurney did a great job of bringing in guys who are big we talked about beefing up the offensive line
2783196 the offensive line did a great job in protection the quarterback went through his progressions and i was wide open
2783197 i just made the play it felt great but were still trying to get better

2783217 characteristically as always the devilish white man lacks the moral strength and courage to cast off his arrogance he wants today to buy friends among the non whites he tries characteristically to cover up his past record he does not possess the humility to admit his guilt to try and atone for his crimes

2783245 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
2783246 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
2783247 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business
2783248 were so very satisfied to be at 40 million plus after five days you couldnt ask for more
2783249 its never been this rough to get tech companies to ipo
2783250 were seeing entrepreneurs more than willing to go the acquisition route rather than go public
2783251 when they look at how long a trek it is to go public an ipo is no longer the golden ring
2783252 most tech ipos tend to be smaller high growth companies with a relatively greater degree of risk
2783253 so it becomes harder to prove themselves to an ipo audience that is looking for a lower amount of risk
2783254 with nine of the last 10 ipos trading below their initial price companies see this and are willing to wait it out
2783255 companies that need these funds to grow will at some point look at alternative sources
2783256 because of the slowdown companies are looking at their it budgets
2783257 hopefully when the market is open again tech companies will be ready
2783258 we need the market to stabilize and see one or two companies that step up and have a strong debut
2783259 my guess is that while this curtailed naked short selling in the short run i suspect people found clever and sophisticated ways to work around it through derivatives
2783260 if the sec removes the rule it will give the short sellers the edge in the market they are looking for
2783261 we will go back to the world as it was the day before cox testified that the emergency order was coming
2783262 our strategies remained pretty much the same what did change however was the level of compliance involved before making trades
2783263 before we can make a trade that involves short stock in those affected names we have to verify that the customer has pre borrowed the stock and then get confirmation from the firm that lent the stock this slows us down and eats up quite a bit of manpower that can be better used elsewhere
2783264 but he chose me and i agreed to marry him right away
2783265 at least 20 percent of the families on the island have been lifted out of poverty
2783266 we were angry at each other in a quiet way
2783267 a marriage that is not based on love often brings problems
2783268 how can you live happily ever after when you met your husband three weeks before the wedding
2783269 any country will do ill take anyone who will accept me
2783270 we had to work no matter how hot it was no matter how much it rained from 5 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon sometimes we could only afford rice porridge
2783271 its my destiny to be poor if i had another daughter id ask her to marry a foreigner
2783272 taiwanese women want to get married when they are much older and they are also very opinionated
2783273 no one ever came on our trip without finding their dream bride
2783274 they take hundreds of women at a time to a hotel and line them up for the men
2783275 there wont be anyone left for us marriage shouldnt be about money it should be about love
2783276 the fact that deputy tollison took his closed fist and struck the suspect in the face 13 times in my opinion was excessive
2783277 then they have the audacity to treat this man as if hes a piece of meat and taser him with electrical jolts to his body and then thats not enough
2783278 que tonto el pensar que no existe amor pero existe

2783334 seems you made the page small and the same time put more items on the page resulting in something i cant see
2783335 i had no idea when you interviewed me that you considered much of my later work to be sentimental rubbish or that you thought songs like uptown girl and we didnt start the fire were abominations and your back slapping buddy buddy style of conversation betrayed no indication that you actually compared talking with me to sleeping with an inflatable girlfriend
2783336 you didnt bring any of this up during the interview and i certainly would have welcomed the opportunity to discuss those kinds of things person to person i believe that its always best to be upfront with someone when you have strong opinions about their work or their image simply as a gesture of respect or if the respect isnt there then purely as professionalism had i known you felt this way i still would have done the bloody interview but your comments reveal you to be already critically predisposed and somewhat insincere you are still welcome to attend our concert in auckland but just as a safety precaution please wear a hockey mask

2783523 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2783524 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
2783525 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2783526 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
2783527 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2783528 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
2783529 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
2783530 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
2783531 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2783532 he translated the pain of the palestinians in a magical way
2783533 he made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions
2783534 today i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighters gun do not let the olive branch fall from my hand
2783535 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve

2783578 the passing of our great poet mahmoud darwish the lover of palestine the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project and the brilliant national leader will leave a great gap in our political cultural and national lives
2783579 he represented palestinian pain and experience since the nakba in 1948 when he was a child until the last breakaway in 2006 which he suffered as a pain in his heart
2783580 we hope the absence of mahmoud darwish will help unite the palestinian people

2783584 once you have the perk to take it away is seen as a violation of a psychological contract you have with your employee
2783585 the issue is whether these practices are important in recruiting and retaining people
2783586 if you are taking anything away from employees its important to explain the need for doing it
2783587 it helps a lot if the need is something driven by factors outside the firm the need to improve share price isnt going to satisfy a lot of people
2783588 i do not recommend taking away perks but if a company has to management needs to remember that taking things away from people almost always leads to feelings of unfairness
2783589 if management does such a thing it has to be very sure to explain very very clearly why it was necessary in a way that seems fair to the employees
2783590 the groundswell is a social trend in which people use technologies to get the things they need from each other rather than from traditional institutions like corporations
2783591 the more you know and understand the individuals who make up the groundswell around your brand and your company the more you can use the new social networking phenomenon to your advantage
2783592 are comfortable with technology interested in parenting and have above average incomes
2783593 but they have no time so if youre trying to reach them you dont give them blogs you give them communities of their peers with opportunities for feedback
2783594 any successful strategy to tap into the groundswell has to begin with assessing customers social activities then you can decide what you want to accomplish plan for how your relationship with your customers will change and finally decide what social technology to use

2783599 i was shocked i complained to staff they have got two prices regulars prices and non regulars prices
2783600 when brian realised how much he was paying he disputed it we know the governor
2783601 he did say we have prices for regulars and prices for people who dont come here very often he dropped himself in it
2783602 it is not true at all that we fail to have tariffs on display and charge different prices
2783603 the price list is up on the bar now what has happened is some of the prices have changed
2783604 and it is not correct to say that regulars get drinks at better prices than tourists

2783642 ive never seen anything like it where im able to promote lobsters at a reasonable price
2783643 if the economy stays like this its going to put a lot of guys out of business
2783644 theres probably going to be some people fishing this year who arent going to be around next year the guys that have low debt will survive and the ones that have debt wont
2783645 it puts a real strain on your business youre operating at a very slim margin
2783646 so the lobsterman gets squeezed because hes got the cost going up and hes got a product he has to get rid of because if you do raise the price too high it shuts off the markets
2783647 pretty soon restaurants take it off the menu and say call me when it gets more reasonable
2783648 the average family isnt going out for a lobster dinner this summer with the high cost of fuel and everything else

2783688 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2783689 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2783690 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2783698 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2783699 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2783700 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2783701 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2783702 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2783704 parents rarely let go of their children so children let go of them they move on they move away the moments that used to define them a mothers approval a fathers nod are covered by moments of their own accomplishments it is not until much later as the skin sags and the heart weakens that children understand their stories and all their accomplishments sit atop the stories of their mothers and fathers stones upon stones beneath the water

2783714 okay much loved worked for the poor a man who was self made and all about integrity and honesty considering all of that and this stunning admission what type of political career could this man have going forward
2783715 i begin to see how true it is that god shows no partiality rather that any person who fears god and does what is right is acceptable to god
2783716 no one who believes in god will be put to shame
2783717 everyone who calls on the name of the most high will be saved
2783718 there is a name every day that is the nature of the business
2783719 i cant answer it because ive not got a direct answer its possible we could sign someone this week we are trying weve got one or two options we are looking at and hopefully we can get something done before the start of the season
2783720 were looking at options elsewhere all over the place wed like to add to our squad
2783721 were making some moves in that direction but nothing to report
2783722 it was a different pressure from a couple of months ago it was quite relaxed this time
2783723 i dont know how it got to penalties we dominated possession and had some good chances but its this issue with scoring goals at the moment but if you are making chances as numerous as we were we shouldnt worry about it this was as good a test as you will get because portsmouth are a very experienced and powerful team
2783724 i think we gave him the right number of minutes
2783725 that was perfect for him when you think he has been out that length of time and come back the way he has its remarkable
2783726 it is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit

2783729 i have to say we have had a lot of practice executing something of this magnitude because of harry potter
2783730 given the publicity from athletes wearing the masks i think its likely well see brands rolling these out in multiple colors
2783731 its a symbol of something that is happening in this country as well
2783732 even with the low visibility you can see olympic sponsors billboards as long as youre within a few blocks of them
2783733 theres been fear for months about pollution during the games
2783734 the images of athletes arriving wearing face masks and stories of teams bringing in their own food have hurt the nations pride however the excitement over the games is irrepressible and i dont think a hazy sky will dampen that
2783735 it takes away the human dimension from each of the individuals so that youre dealing with the words on a cell phone screen but not doing the same kind of connecting to the full person which is important in weighing whether to stay or go in a relationship
2783736 images of their face their sense of smell the sound of their voice
2783737 you have to do the physical work of putting it in an envelope addressing it and carrying it to the post box
2783738 if someone needs to pick up milk on the way home and its great for even quick little communications of terms of endearment i cant wait to see you but i dont think its a way people should use to negotiate relationships
2783739 they require time texting is a time saver relationships i believe should be time intensive we shouldnt short cut our relationships
2783740 you may want to say it very differently 24 hours later
2783741 so dry and so reduced to the minimal terms of human communication
2783742 the means of communications that we have are a mirror of our society and we live in a society thats expedient we dont want to take the time to think things over we dont have the time most of the time to dwell on painful hurtful situations we just want to get over it and move on

2783749 however if such an order is at par with our demands we will agree to it but only after it reaches to us in writing
2783750 they are doing so much of blackmail on this issue

2783752 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
2783753 this is a classic example of a no win situation
2783754 i have repeatedly said im not a muslim but this whole strategy of suggesting that i am is indicative of anti muslim strategy that we have to fight against
2783755 if you were a muslim and somebody consistently said you were a christian i suspect that you would want to have that corrected
2783756 american people are more tolerant and open minded than a lot of the pundits give them credit for
2783757 certain harms may go unaddressed the larger protection of the church and religious freedom is the overriding concern
2783758 the government cant get involved in overseeing religious practices the best way to say it is its not american
2783759 if she did prevail that would erase about 150 years of law in this country from the supreme court saying the government does not get involved in the internal affairs and operations of the church it would effectively be the end of church independence and religious freedom in our country
2783760 inconsistent with us supreme court precedent and extends far beyond the protections our constitution affords religious conduct
2783761 we never planned how many children to have we just let god guide our lives you know because we strongly believe life comes from god and thats the reason we did not stop the life

2783805 ik denk dat we een heel eind voorbij eind 2008 moeten gaan voordat we de vastgoedproblemen te boven komen
2783806 ik denk dat de hoofdvraag voor de economie is te weten wanneer het herstel van de immobili n achter ons ligt want tot dan zullen we instabiliteit kennen op onze kapitaalmarkten
2783807 organising something on the scale of the lambeth conference will inevitably result in a small deficit sometimes
2783808 the archbishops council met last week to propose a solution
2783809 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2783810 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2783811 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2783812 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2783813 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2783814 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter

2783847 its another one of the rights that big government has taken away from the people
2783848 theyre still going to fight theyre still going to fight for years to come
2783849 theyve still got cockfighting in every state they just hide it from the law
2783850 cockfighting may still be going on with much smaller venues in the back woods but my understanding is there hasnt been any big activity since the gambling ban
2783851 a lot of people are going to quit theyre just going to shut down
2783852 were losing out on an opportunity to keep our heritage and our culture
2783853 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
2783854 the main source of support for the u s economy in recent quarters has been the strength of net exports
2783855 but the world economy has fallen off the edge of a cliff
2783856 i am twenty years old and am in college right now to be a preschool teacher i love kids have always babysat and would love to work with infants
2783857 goldie loves everyone and all other dogs and yes even cats i only wish i was as always as good natured and happy as she is

2783886 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
2783887 i have no idea ive not spoken to him about that as youre aware im sure senator edwards announced through one of his staffers he would not be attending the convention in denver
2783888 lets be very honest theres weakness when it comes to both political parties i feel very badly for john and elizabeth who are friends i know them and i know their families theyre going through a very difficult time i hope they can resolve this between them
2783889 obviously he let a lot of people down i feel for elizabeth but you know the public is forgiving obviously this is something between himself and his family and voters you know i feel for that family i still believe that john edwards is committed to reducing poverty i think his concern in the campaign was genuine
2783890 this is a difficult period you know but im just not going to be one of those that pile on richardson continued
2783891 barack obama has such a squeaky clean family image but its not over i dont think anybody in political circles including democrats believes edwards claim that he is not the father of this child
2783892 and then you additionally you have the money angle which is fred baron big trial lawyer big supporter of john edwards paying millions of dollars to relocate rielle hunter and andrew young and his family the man who has claimed paternity for the child to california supposedly just out of the goodness of his heart and without telling john edwards
2783893 any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2783894 i was assured no economic blockade shall be allowed and every effort will be made to keep the highway open
2783895 if you know john mccain you know theres not going to be much politics in the white house
2783896 chris youre going to have to come to the republican convention
2783897 people who are going to china should take a clean computer one with no data at all
2783898 what the chinese tried to do after the tibet protests was infiltrate journalists security to see who in china the tibet movement was talking to
2783899 while living in close proximity are worlds apart putting the uighurs on the wrong side of the tracks in their own home
2783900 did not have a good reputation among the han who regarded them as lazy unreliable and more eager for a handout than a days work in five years working all over xinjiang he said he had only seen a handful of uighur workers all capable and hardworking in skilled positions mostly they are engaged as manual labor clearing work sites
2783901 here no communist would dare speak uighur at any official function its always chinese
2783902 the problem for uighurs may be that in the ranks of the dispossessed who are revolting throughout china they pose less risk to the government and are thus not deemed worth the trouble of co opting
2783903 when you discuss security issues if you are telling the truth that should be something protected at the core of the first amendment
2783904 if you are truthfully telling the world about a dangerous situation and it is a situation which is dangerous not because the security researcher exposes the vulnerability but because the person who made the product made the vulnerability then this should be core speech
2783905 knowingly causes the transmission of a program information code or command to a computer or computer system
2783906 the statute on its face appears to be discussing sending code or similar types of information to a computer
2783907 it does not appear to contemplate somebody who is giving a talk to humans nevertheless the court believed that the act of giving a presentation to a group of humans was covered by the computer fraud computer intrusion statute we believe this is wrong
2783908 basically what the court is suggesting here is that giving a presentation involving security to other security researchers is a violation of federal law
2783909 as far as i know this is completely unprecedented and it has a tremendous chilling effect on sharing this sort of research and we intend to fight it with everything weve got
2783910 someone responsible for components of the mbtas fare collection system the next day the agency contacted mit computer science professor ron rivest the students instructor and told him that the fbi was investigating the issue
2783911 we didnt find that to be a very pleasing way to start a nice dialogue with them
2783912 and at that point we declined to provide the slides until we had an opportunity to see what the complaint said
2783913 note that we absolutely are not disclosing everything we found in this report
2783914 please understand that rhetoric aside the intention was to provide an interesting and useful talk but not one that would enable people to defraud the massachusetts bay transit system
2783915 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2783916 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2783917 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2783918 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2783919 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2783920 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2783921 with the pervasiveness of okl4 ok labs has quickly become the industry standard
2783922 there is no better way to achieve unprecedented safety and security than with okl4 and secure hypercell technology
2783923 the military institution says it is ok to kill and use the most horrible weapons and that killing the enemy is heroic
2783924 i respect dick for having humanity over his military obligations
2783925 the regular people and the government wanted to surrender but the military people didnt want to surrender
2783926 i believe it is the stubbornness of the military people that caused the bombing of japan
2783927 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2783928 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2783929 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2783930 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2783931 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2783932 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2783933 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2783934 he was a clever bowler and used his cutters well
2783935 and if conditions were right he was a very dangerous bowler
2783936 weve been working with nanotechnology and weve developed something very interesting right now i cannot elaborate but we have found a market for this
2783937 with ncrs advanced technology these machines will dispense a wide array of dvds and could offer digital downloading in the future all under the blockbuster brand
2783938 this initial rollout provides consumers increasingly convenient access to their favorite movies and is one more step in the fulfillment of our mission to transform blockbuster into a multi channel provider of media entertainment
2783939 this alliance with blockbuster is an exciting step for ncr as we pursue our mission of becoming the leader in the market for entertainment self service solutions
2783940 looking beyond this initial deployment our mutual goal is to have 10 000 kiosks installed within 18 months we are energized and thrilled to be such an integral part of blockbusters strategy for providing consumers with greater choice and convenience
2783941 it turns out they hit both military and civilian airports
2783942 its never been this rough to get tech companies to ipo
2783943 were seeing entrepreneurs more than willing to go the acquisition route rather than go public
2783944 when they look at how long a trek it is to go public an ipo is no longer the golden ring
2783945 most tech ipos tend to be smaller high growth companies with a relatively greater degree of risk
2783946 so it becomes harder to prove themselves to an ipo audience that is looking for a lower amount of risk
2783947 with nine of the last 10 ipos trading below their initial price companies see this and are willing to wait it out
2783948 because of the slowdown companies are looking at their it budgets
2783949 hopefully when the market is open again tech companies will be ready
2783950 we need the market to stabilize and see one or two companies that step up and have a strong debut
2783951 until now the agitation and protests were confined to jammu at the on 13th august it will be expanded throughout the country and if need arises we will be forced to give a call like ayodhya chalo amarnath chalo jammu
2783952 well there is many players obviously there is federer and nadal the two best players in the world and two biggest favourite where ever they play and on what ever surface but then there is andy murray who is playing great tennis at the moment recently he won the masters in cincinnati so i think he is a big threat
2783953 we played once once we warm up for a competition i think it was ten or under 12 years old and we hit together for a warm up and i tried to hit so good to impress him that i was tired i couldnt play my match so lost so since then i dont want to
2783954 of course theres always pressure i think when you come from a country like india where people are so emotional about their heroes and their athletes and whatever it is yeah but i think its very good pressure i think this is a pressure that everyone dreams of to be the medal hope at the olympics for your own country i am very excited to be here to be at my first olympics first time in china as well yeah im gonna just try and turn that pressure into a positive and the least i can do is give my best
2783955 people have suffered injuries during the agitation and some people have lost their lives about seven people have lost lives in both jammu and kashmir in the violence both state and central government will give them compensation
2783956 the sad part is that since elections are coming near so political parties have found a way to further aggravate the entire situation
2783957 there is no economic blockade and if at all there are a few some cases then we are taking it seriously i am in conversation with punjab chief minister badal parkash singh and also constantly in touch with home minister we will seriously look into the matter if any problem arises fruit traders will not face any problem i have appealed to people that they should not be scared and should continue with their work and if we get any complaint we will look into the matter
2783958 we have said that its a long term issue this cannot be addressed immediately it will be resolved in long term only but firstly peace should prevail here the situation is aggravated and the communal and regional divisions have been sharpened such situation should be controlled victims of violence should be given compensation fruit traders should be protected and closed road should be reopened at any cost
2783959 even after curfew relaxation shops in the market are mostly closed nobody is getting anything daily necessities like food medicines are also not available there is no wheat and rice at the departmental stores there is no water and electricity in spite of all these problems government says that they have relaxed the curfew this is absolutely wrong
2783960 its not compulsory to claim defence ministry as all the parties representing the cabinet would be incorporated in the national security council
2783961 its trial by fire theres drama here this is a tough town
2783962 we have many difficult and challenging assignments every day we wanted to give them some practical exposure
2783963 when the time comes i wont be bogged down by fear
2783964 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
2783965 every soldier and officer should absolutely disobey any order to kill muslims or aid their killers
2783966 thats too subtle the mass audience will never understand what she needs is some big obvious flaw so everybody can agree shes not attractive
2783967 if we become part of russia i think that the way we live will in many ways be better than it is now
2783968 they were always the hometown airline they were in the downtown parades they invested in the community
2783969 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2783970 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts
2783971 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about
2783972 the more you raise fees the more you drive airlines and customers away
2783973 its rhetoric ive heard for 41 years but i understand
2783974 these folks arent sure if theyre going to be in business in six months
2783975 on the other hand airports are very dependent on the airlines bringing passengers
2783976 lots of guys from bombay were at all three marches so whats this about us not participating its just that i think we wanted to do this a bit differently and no why cant we be different this way we can have our cake go for any of the other three marches and also have our own where other cities can participate this time we have large contingents coming from pune surat baroda bangalore ahmedabad delhi and kolkata
2783977 sure there are class community and other differences at least bombay handles it honestly i know there are diferences in kolkata delhi and bangalore too and they flare up quite frequently on the net here we sit down and thrash them out across the table there is a saying in hindi when there are so many vessels close together they do make noise
2783978 come on bombay is different it is the most corporate and business like of all indian cities do you think any other city would have thought of pink gandhi topis for the march it also shows indias pluralism
2783979 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2783980 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2783981 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2783982 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2783983 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2783984 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2783985 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2783986 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2783987 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2783988 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here
2783989 but i was a willing participant you can call it lust i really thought i would get off like a lot of people who are deluded
2783990 they told me that i was a hero and that they wished they could do the same in their countries
2783991 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2783992 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2783993 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2783994 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2783995 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2783996 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2783997 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2783998 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2783999 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2784000 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men
2784001 if anyone asks a man that he will slap you

2784009 its possible we could sign someone this week we are trying weve got one or two options we are looking at and hopefully we can get something done before the start of the season
2784010 were looking at options elsewhere all over the place wed like to add to our squad
2784011 were making some moves in that direction but nothing to report
2784012 it was a different pressure from a couple of months ago it was quite relaxed this time
2784013 i dont know how it got to penalties we dominated possession and had some good chances but its this issue with scoring goals at the moment but if you are making chances as numerous as we were we shouldnt worry about it
2784014 this was as good a test as you will get because portsmouth are a very experienced and powerful team
2784015 i think we gave him the right number of minutes
2784016 that was perfect for him when you think he has been out that length of time and come back the way he has its remarkable
2784017 i spoke with kaka yesterday saturday we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet

2784019 he is waiting for a deal and then he will start to negotiate with chelsea
2784020 normally milan do not sell their best players we think they like the proposal but it is not so easy for them to accept it

2784034 el tema del agua es el protagonista de la muestra y porque no nos escuchan en el resto de instituciones como la confederaci n hidrogr fica del ebro o el gobierno de arag n
2784035 todo un desprop sito por parte de las instituciones aragonesas porque cuestan mucho dinero y porque no se puede hacer obras hidr ulicas que quitan agua a cuencas deficitarias para d rsela a otras que si tienen
2784036 todos los problemas que tengan que ver con las fuentes de agua que son los r os son interesantes de estudiar y de buscar soluciones

2784053 i think for full restoration of the constitution and for the survival of this nation and for democracy in this country it is very necessary that gen musharraf resigns himself otherwise the impeachment will start

2784214 you ask people what other people are going to say and reward them on how accurate they are
2784215 it will tell you what a survey would tell you but its quicker cheaper and more fun because there are prizes
2784216 i wrote a life plan saying id be an entrepreneur in technology and then would migrate to academia
2784217 but three decades ago my vision of being a professor was that at the end of an executive career youd put on a tweed jacket with leather arm patches and you just show up
2784218 it is very important to publish papers that wow your fellow professors in terms of their technical proficiency and their intellectual ambition rather than just practical business decisions
2784219 it was a culture shock in academia youre supposed to be humble and not take too much credit for anything
2784220 in business youre in competition and you have to proclaim your merits
2784221 it might seem that the ideal business school teacher is someone who has lived business and can convey their experience i definitely value this
2784222 but corporate practitioners do not perform the other key function that most business schools value which is cutting edge research
2784223 i let my business experience influence the determination of what problem is interesting and i let my academic training influence the methodology and approach that will cut muster with everyone

2784255 sekarang sampai juni 2008 tercatat 413 kasus di seluruh 26 kabupaten dan kota di jabar serta tersebar di 240 desa dan 133 kecamatan
2784256 buruknya lingkungan dan sanitasi menyebabkan nyamuk yang merupakan vektor penyebar penyakit kaki gajah cepat berkembang biak
2784257 dengan ditemukan kasus kasus baru diharapkan penularan penyakit itu bisa dicegah dan pasien dapat lebih dini diobati
2784258 kusta merupakan penyakit yang terkait penuh dengan kemiskinan semakin minimnya pasokan gizi semakin mudah orang yang sering berinteraksi dengan penderita kusta menjadi tertular sebaliknya jika pasokan gizi baik kemungkinan penularan tidak terjadi
2784259 merebaknya kasus ini karena adanya penderita yang tidak diobati sehingga penyakit ini menular
2784260 penyakit penyakit tropis itu tidak bisa dibuat nol yang bisa dilakukan adalah menekan angka kasus penyakitnya dengan berbagai upaya bidang kesehatan
2784261 eropa dulu dikenal sebagai daerah endemik kolera cacar dan beberapa penyakit lain dengan meningkatnya taraf pendidikan dan ekonomi penyakit penyakit itu bisa diatasi
2784262 sayangnya memang wali kota dan kepala bkd badan kepegawaian daerah pematang siantar tak bisa kami mintai keterangan
2784263 memang betul datanya ada yang anak pejabat ada juga kerabat dari istri pejabat yang bersangkutan kami memang mencium indikasi kkn yang sangat kuat dari kasus ini
2784264 saya pada tahun 1945 ke mana mana cuma bisa jalan kaki sekarang transportasi bagus tapi mahal pendidikan maju tapi banyak yang enggak mampu bayar sistem pemerintahan pun jauh lebih baik dari sentralistik jadi desentralisasi tapi justru memperkuat lagi semangat kedaerahan
2784265 merdeka soal apa dulu mas dulu di tahun 60 an ibu saya ngantre minyak tanah dan susah nyari beras kemarin kemarin ini tetangga saya masih banyak yang ngantre minyak tanah dan susah beli beras karena mahal belum lagi minyak goreng langka biaya pendidikan mahal harga bbm melambung lah apanya yang merdeka kalo kita tambah susah
2784266 korupsi makin menggila pemerintah pun tidak tegas kayaknya banyak intervensi atas penyelesaian korupsi yang melibatkan pejabat pejabat negara
2784267 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it
2784268 any people anywhere being inclined and having the power have the right to rise up and shake off the existing government and form a new one that suits them better this is a most valuable a most sacred right a right which we hope and believe is to liberate the world
2784269 what i would most desire would be the separation of the white and black races
2784270 see our present condition the country engaged in war our white men cutting one anothers throats and then consider what we know to be the truth but for your race among us there could not be war although many men engaged on either side do not care for you one way or another
2784271 why should the people of your race be colonized and where why should they leave this country this is perhaps the first question for proper consideration you and we are different races we have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races whether it is right or wrong i need not discuss but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both as i think your race suffer very greatly many of them by living among us while ours suffer from your presence in a word we suffer on each side if this be admitted it affords a reason at least why we should be separated it is better for both therefore to be separated
2784272 i will say then that i am not nor have ever been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the black and white races that i am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intermarry with white people and i will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which will ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality and inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior and i as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race
2784273 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2784274 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2784275 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2784276 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2784277 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2784278 just so you all know we did set a record
2784279 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2784280 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2784281 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2784282 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
2784283 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
2784284 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2784285 i have nothing i lost it all when the power went out
2784286 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2784287 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2784288 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2784289 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2784290 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2784291 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2784292 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2784293 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2784294 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2784295 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2784296 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2784297 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2784298 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2784299 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2784300 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2784301 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2784302 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2784303 it has been pressing since the end of last season
2784304 we like to operate with four strikers and we have not been able to do that
2784305 i cant answer the question because i dont have the right answer
2784306 it is possible i will sign someone this week we are trying and we are looking at one or two options
2784307 psychedelics bring to mind some questions about perception like sometimes my hallucinations are so faint im not sure if theyre real or if im imagining them but then i realize whats the difference seeing a color and imagining it uses the same part of the brain and with no external stimulus to measure there is no objective way to tell which one it is and if i cant tell the difference there is no subjective way either people with synesthesia see colors but know they arent real and have a hard time explaining whether they see the colors or are just imagining them i think about these questions when im sober too but i tend to think theyre trivial and silly and psychedelics make them seem important
2784308 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2784309 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2784310 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2784311 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2784312 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2784313 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2784314 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2784315 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2784316 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2784317 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2784318 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2784319 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2784320 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2784321 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2784322 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2784323 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2784324 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2784325 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2784326 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2784327 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2784328 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2784329 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2784330 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2784331 getting my 100 was not an issue i just wanted to keep going for the team keep pushing the score along of course its disappointing but that really wasnt the issue
2784332 ideally we should have got a 250 lead so we fell a bit short but the ball is doing a bit and if the bowlers hit their stride tomorrow we can win this
2784333 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2784334 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2784335 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2784336 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2784337 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2784338 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2784339 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2784340 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2784341 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2784342 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2784343 and then she said you were sorry but she totally did say this she said you were a slag yep yep shes a total psycho and her skirts are way too short
2784344 my thighs are soooooo fat hair is too straight nose too big
2784345 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2784346 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2784347 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2784348 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2784349 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2784350 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2784351 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2784352 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2784353 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2784354 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2784355 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2784356 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2784357 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2784358 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2784359 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2784360 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2784361 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2784362 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2784363 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
2784364 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2784365 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2784366 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2784367 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2784368 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2784369 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2784370 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2784371 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2784372 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2784373 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2784374 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2784375 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2784376 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2784377 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2784378 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2784379 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2784380 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2784381 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2784382 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2784383 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2784384 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2784385 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2784386 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2784387 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2784388 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2784389 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2784390 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2784391 the fishbein family came up with the idea of giving this trail as a gift
2784392 in 1993 we built our first green building but it didnt create the buzz this building has so we can thank al gore or oil at 140 a barrel our trail has come along at the right time and very much with a purpose
2784393 we wanted to see the composting toilets in any building approved and open to the public
2784394 if small children and international visitors accepted the bathrooms we concluded friends and relatives could accept this idea
2784395 the more we did the more we wanted to do
2784396 this stands as a shining example of what can and should be done in new construction
2784397 this building is very advanced and very functional but has much less of an environmental footprint than any traditional building would
2784398 if we are to live sustainably in the future we really have to change the way we live
2784399 climate change is the number one issue of our time
2784400 at mass audubon we are making a tremendous effort in this area
2784401 seven thousand people in july alone came through this building
2784402 a lot of people were interested in green features and how they could apply them to their own home
2784403 things can be a little more expensive but over time it pays for itself and uses less energy green materials dont have to be renewed and the more and more green materials are produced the price will come down
2784404 it had to grow organically and look like it was part of a whole
2784405 cheated on more times than a blind woman playing scrabble with gypsies
2784406 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
2784407 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
2784408 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
2784409 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
2784410 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
2784411 is designed to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind
2784412 loony liberalism a kind of ideological m nage a trois between timothy leary karl marx and al gore
2784413 matriarchal environmentalist multicultural anti male anti family anti individual and public hygiene shibboleths are enforced by orwellian regulatory agencies commissions and tribunals better known as the smoke smut seat belt thought language and calorie police
2784414 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2784415 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2784416 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2784417 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2784418 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2784419 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2784420 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2784421 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2784422 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2784423 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2784424 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2784425 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2784426 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2784427 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2784428 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2784429 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2784430 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2784431 theyre a pair of chicken breasts almost as big as those
2784432 first i want an omelet with bacon and cheese and then
2784433 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2784434 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2784435 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2784436 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2784437 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2784438 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2784439 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2784440 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2784441 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2784442 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2784443 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
2784444 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2784445 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2784446 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2784447 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war

2784449 the one constant in republican victories in fall elections has been large margins in springfield and those surrounding counties
2784450 if you dont campaign hard in a region of the state that is growing that represents a lot of votes
2784451 a good performing republican will get 65 percent of the vote in greene and surrounding counties
2784452 this race will be fought and won in the margins
2784453 if youre a democrat and cant get north of 40 percent in greene county youre in trouble
2784454 a lot of things hes said have really turned off and angered a lot of people including greene county democrats
2784455 the threat of obama is enough to get the hard core conservatives out
2784456 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2784457 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2784458 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2784459 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2784460 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2784461 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2784462 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2784463 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2784464 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2784465 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2784466 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2784467 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2784468 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2784469 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2784470 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2784471 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2784472 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2784473 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2784474 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2784475 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2784476 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2784477 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2784478 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2784479 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2784480 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2784481 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2784482 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2784483 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2784484 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2784485 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2784486 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2784487 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2784488 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2784489 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2784490 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2784491 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2784492 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2784493 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2784494 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2784495 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2784496 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2784497 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2784498 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2784499 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2784500 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2784501 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2784502 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2784503 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2784504 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2784505 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2784506 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2784507 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2784508 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2784509 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2784510 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2784511 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2784512 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2784513 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2784514 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2784515 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2784516 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2784517 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2784518 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2784519 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2784520 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2784521 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2784522 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2784523 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2784524 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2784525 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2784526 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2784527 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2784528 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2784529 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2784530 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2784531 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2784532 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2784533 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2784534 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2784535 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2784536 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2784537 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2784538 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2784539 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2784540 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2784541 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2784542 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2784543 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2784544 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2784545 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2784546 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2784547 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2784548 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2784549 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2784550 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2784551 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2784552 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2784553 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2784554 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2784555 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2784556 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2784557 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2784558 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2784559 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2784560 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2784561 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2784562 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2784563 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2784564 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2784565 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2784566 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2784567 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2784568 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
2784569 a number of utilities have reported that only 20 percent to 30 percent of their customers are aware that a green power option is offered
2784570 thats confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
2784571 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program
2784572 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
2784573 as much as 1 billion on renewable generation over the next 10 years
2784574 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that
2784575 but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
2784576 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2784577 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2784578 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2784579 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2784580 por causar descr dito a la competici n ol mpica
2784581 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2784582 channel 4 will not be in a hurry to commission him poor old durkin again
2784583 it is entirely appropriate that people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2784584 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2784585 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2784586 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2784587 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2784588 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2784589 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2784590 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2784591 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2784592 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2784593 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2784594 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2784595 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2784596 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2784597 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2784598 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2784599 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2784600 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2784601 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2784602 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2784603 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2784604 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2784605 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2784606 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2784607 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2784608 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2784609 customers can protect their media investment and maximise their it spend thanks to the backward read write compatibility and simplified deployment and proven compatibility with sun storagetek enterprise tape libraries
2784610 the integration of suns latest world leading fast access enterprise tape drive design and imations long standing media expertise delivers optimised throughput with storage capacity hitting an unprecedented 1 tb
2784611 we have focused on the advancement of tape technology for more than 50 years and remain committed to delivering the advanced tape storage solutions that enterprise customers demand
2784612 when we launched our tera angstrom coating operation in 2004 we set a goal to deliver 1 tb of native capacity in a cartridge before the end of the decade today we are pleased to hit that milestone as we continue to work with sun helping customers maximise and protect their automated tape library investments
2784613 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2784614 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2784615 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2784616 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2784617 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2784618 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2784619 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2784620 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2784621 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2784622 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2784623 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2784624 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2784625 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2784626 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2784627 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2784628 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2784629 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2784630 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2784631 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2784632 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2784633 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2784634 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2784635 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2784636 the only issue that hit home is the war because of him
2784637 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2784638 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2784639 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2784640 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2784641 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2784642 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2784643 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2784644 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2784645 hes a guy who makes tough decisions he takes charge hes ready to sacrifice his interest on behalf of the country
2784646 um not to put you on the spot but on 24 palmer was the first african american president
2784647 those string of events really resulted in what the ioc sees as a scandalous saga that overshadowed the athens games and brought the ioc and the olympic movement as a whole into disrepute
2784648 if we become part of russia i think that the way we live will in many ways be better than it is now
2784649 its a dream to be in the final round competing for a major championship
2784650 the greens are more receptive you can shoot a pretty decent score but its quite windy out there and the course is playing really long
2784651 osetia del sur fue blanco de una agresi n muy dura c nica por parte de georgia personas nuestros ciudadanos murieron los habitantes de osetia del sur y nuestros soldados de las fuerzas de mantenimiento de la paz
2784652 la forma en que actuaron del lado georgiano no puede ser calificada de otra manera sino genocidio porque estas acciones adquirieron un giro masivo e iban dirigidas contra ciertas personas la poblaci n civil las fuerzas de mantenimiento de la paz que cumplieron su misi n de paz en la regi n

2784660 no es razonable que un distrito escuche por la radio que el diputado que los va a representar no es uno por el que hayan votado sino uno que una comisi n pol tica con l gicas muy opacas haya decidido sin transmitir criterios
2784661 parece curioso y contradictorio el hecho de que se le est entregando competencia a una entidad como un partido pol tico que no es de las autoridades reconocidas por la constituci n para ejercer soberan a popular la decisi n de designar unilateralmente al reemplazante de un diputado o senador que ha dejado vacante un cargo

2784673 an example of senator mccains push to spread democracy in that part of the world as a very important advance of americas interest
2784674 i wish senator obama had actually confronted the issue not trying to detract our attention by focusing on a mccain adviser
2784675 i think this is another example during these uncertain times where we need experienced leadership we need someone like senator mccain who will take a stronger view a more experienced view when it comes to international security and protecting americas interest
2784676 what senator mccain wants to do is continue the bush policies of trying to isolate russia its not working
2784677 i would say obama is spending exactly the same amount of time attacking us and frankly probably more money
2784678 obama started negative campaigning on john mccain long before we started punching back
2784679 barack obama has been in the united states senate less than 300 working days he has voted for 90 tax increases
2784680 now we could have an ad on every tax increase hes voted on every single day between now and the election and still not get them all in
2784681 the profit taking by the oil companies is not being used to look for new sources of oil and gas overwhelmingly theyre buying back their stock theyre paying out dividends theyre paying the ceo salaries
2784682 when john mccain says well they need 4 billion more in tax breaks he just doesnt understand the reality of what this economy is facing
2784683 those are the folks who have been disadvantaged by a war thats costing us 10 billion to 12 billion a month a war thats taking money out of our economy that could be spent here in america
2784684 we have no plans to insert money into either of those two institutions

2784739 although dental and skeletal fluorosis have been recognized in india as early as 1937 4 the non skeletal entity of fluorosis affecting the soft tissues and organs of the body is relatively a new condition confirmed through different studies
2784740 fluorosis is a well defined clinical entity characterized by toxic effects of high fluoride intake on teeth bones and soft tissues 1 9 increased oxygen radical generation and lipid peroxidation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases and toxic action of a wide range of compounds

2784762 narrative games are barely past the infant stage and critical commentary and analysis about them are even less developed
2784763 everyone is still trying to figure out who everyone else is and in this process communities form themselves we are on the ground floor of this effort to try to figure out how to talk intelligently about video games how to analyze them and develop a critical language to discuss them were not like other disciplines im not even sure i would call us a discipline yet because were all figuring this out together we dont even have the terms yet
2784764 part of our trepidation about what to call it is that there is already a field called game studies and some of us arent comfortable with where thats going or dont feel we quite fit in there

2784782 georges st pierre obviously is impressive but i think anderson silva is the best
2784783 hes the whole package he hasnt really been challenged hes fought top notch competition and hes taken them out every one of them the guys phenomenal hes the most impressive fighter right now georges is up there no doubt
2784784 its one of those fights where you start looking at it and youre going is he too tough for his own good
2784785 he took some big shots big knees big kicks hes a tough kid
2784786 me i dont fight for the fame the belt me i dont care im not the kind of fighter who fights because they have no choice if i want tomorrow i have education i can do something else i like my lifestyle and i fight for myself
2784787 that we were able to dominate so strongly just speaks to georges st pierres strength not to jon fitchs weakness
2784788 and by that time he had hit me so many times in the left eye that i couldnt really see him
2784789 it was a tough fight for me in the corner there were a few times where i was thinking about stopping the fight
2784790 but every time id meet with him in the corner hed recovered and was ready to go again

2784835 hell dave theres no mob presence in this town and there hasnt been for as long as ive been here and thats 1985 maybe in the old days but a long time ago shes kidding herself i dont know the reason arnold disappeared himself but i would bet my bojon butt thats what he did where he got to who knows but thats what that little sweetie is paying you to find out right
2784836 anybody telling you the mafia did murder in 1987 well it just didnt happen dave any of those guys still alive by then they were old and anyway what reason would they have to do it nah youre getting bad info look someplace else
2784837 animals sense that i represent danger she was a stout woman probably about 70 who looked like she was capable of kicking my butt and the expression on her face indicated she wouldnt mind doing it she didnt have a good first impression of me thats not unusual she left me standing with the screen door between us long enough for me to use a line i had been saving for years i feel like a fly out here
2784838 mrs arnold if there was no body and if no one was convicted of killing him how can you be so certain he was murdered
2784839 is there a chance he left you for another woman
2784840 so you are saying that his motivations for staying were love and fear
2784841 no they found it in the parking lot near his office where he always parked
2784842 you told me you are a private investigator but who hired you why are you asking these questions so many years after conrads death
2784843 i have one other question who do you think murdered conrad
2784844 if you find out what happened to him or even if you find out hes still alive you must tell me
2784845 so those kids grew up and want to know what happened to their mother
2784846 some people think arnold and laurina ran off with each other
2784847 mr glick conrad and jeanine had an unhappy marriage thats not unusual but conrad was afraid of jeanine he thought that if he asked her for a divorce she would kill him whether she was capable of that i dont know i didnt know her that well but conrad thought so and thats all that matters when laurina came to work for us there was an immediate attraction even though conrad was many years older everyone in the office knew they were having an affair when laurina stopped coming to work we asked conrad where she was but didnt get an answer two weeks later when he didnt show up at the office and jeanine didnt know where he was we all figured it out immediately i never heard from him again and that surprised me as he had an interest in the partnership practice and i assumed he would ask for his money
2784848 did jeanine get the proceeds from his share she had him declared dead three years later she got his share and she had inherited some family money and she has done all right for herself
2784849 since there was no evidence of foul play i would think it would have been difficult to have conrad declared dead
2784850 not if you play bridge with the judges wife every tuesday
2784851 mr glick insurance companies look only at the bottom line if the policy was for a million they would move heaven and earth looking for conrad before they paid the policy if it was 100 000 they might think it more cost effective to just pay off
2784852 where would you look for conrad and laurina if you wanted to find them
2784853 i dont know if is wise to find them after all this time i know laurinas kids want answers but they very well might not like what they learn
2784854 i appreciate what you are saying mr speken but with all due respect i dont think that you have the right to make that decision for them if they want to find out what happened to their mother whether they want to meet with her or not they should have that knowledge
2784855 i would look in idaho conrad grew up there and spoke fondly of it
2784856 pick me up saturday night at 6 get a haircut
2784857 mrs arnold my name is glick im a private investigator from pueblo i was hired by your daughter to locate you and i guess i have
2784858 i dont want a damned thing and i dont know if katrina does either but i would like to know if you will agree to talk with her or meet with her if that is what she wants
2784859 thats it you haul ass make your kids think you are dead never contact them and now that they are grown you wont even speak to them
2784860 i dont operate that way i dont sell out my clients im going to tell her where you are and she can decide for herself what to do next if i were her i would write you off and forget you but that decision is up to her

2784868 la politica dovrebbe avere a che fare col bene giusto col bene e col giusto
2784869 non capisco perch si debba arrogare il diritto di parlare a nome dei mistilingue
2784870 che pi che mistilingue le chiamerei persone bilingui che parlano perfettamente le due lingue principali del sudtirolo
2784871 rompiballe che sono stati lei si sente un loro discendente non giusto che ogni volta credano di poter parlare a nome di tutti i plurilingue del land
2784872 tu dovresti parlare alle persone che la pensano come te per aggregarle
2784873 non giusto che i militanti dei vari partiti o movimenti parlino a nome di tutti coloro che sono o la pensano come loro
2784874 non giusto che sven knoll o christian kollmann parlino a nome di tutti quelli della s d tirol freiheit che i hans heiss o riccardo della sbarba ogni volta che parlano credano di poter parlare a nome di tutti i verdi gr nen che alessandro urzi o holzmann credano di poter parlare a nome di tutti i militanti di an o che i vari esponenti che si battono per laffermazione della svp ritengano di parlare a nome di tutti i volksparteiani no non giusto
2784875 stolz auf s dtirol poi tanto sicuro ci poterlo affermare a nome di tutti i s dtiroler del land

2784879 dovevo tenermi buono un personaggio politico che nel settore contava molto
2784880 alcuni sono stati costretti alle dimissioni solo per un sospetto altri sono stati premiati con la nomina ad assessore
2784881 lunico politico coinvolto lattuale assessore regionale del polo giancarlo abelli imputato per reati fiscali dopo aver ricevuto 70 milioni di lire con una consulenza a una clinica del professore poggi longostrevi stato prosciolto perch il fatto non costituisce reato
2784882 viene processato per aver fatto false fatture per oltre 70 milioni di lire ricevuti tra il 1996 e il 1997 da poggi longostrevi che prima di togliersi la vita li aveva spiegati cos
2784883 alcuni sono stati costretti alle dimissioni solo per un sospetto altri sono stati premiati con la nomina ad assessore
2784884 il quale mi aveva diffidato da propagandare in internet le informazioni prese da travaglio gomez che ho inserito nel post
2784885 nessuna responsabilit penale accertata per formigoni ma certamente la responsabilit politica di non aver saputo vigilare su un settore da sempre a rischio di corruzione
2784886 se volete dirmi che sono amico di abelli al servizio del complotto giudaico massonico e schiavo del capitalismo oltre che prono al volere di bush fatelo pure

2784893 cultural political and social relationship with the latino community which senator obama does not have
2784894 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to films the students really liked it and it means so much to them to hear real stories and not watch a cheesy drama like so many other videos

2784906 we took him out a little early the other night
2784907 he was getting stiffer and stiffer as the game progressed it was getting hard to get loose he was still throwing great
2784908 were trying to not have this thing get to the point where it did last year
2784909 they said more than likely i wouldnt beat it so theres kind of no point to go through with it and that more than likely it would be a waste of time
2784910 even if youre not guilty the evidence is too strong against you to have a chance
2784911 so that the worse that could happen is what happens instead of 10 days it probably wont set me back too much
2784912 it helps with the off day monday because you can still get normal rest for the other guys he in effect misses his turn but well just reschedule it

2784915 thats a good thing when youre screwing up and nobody says anything to you anymore that means theyve given up on you
2784916 our critics are often the ones telling us they still love us and care about us and want to make us better
2784917 brick walls are there for a reason they give us a chance to show how badly we want something
2784918 have something to bring to the table it will make you more welcome
2784919 this office is too busy to care about what i need
2784920 there is something more important going on here than your phone call youll have to wait
2784921 its very important to know when youre in a pissing match and its very important to get out of it as quickly as possible
2784922 yes but as they grow up and become more aware of the world they start to see that it should be better
2784923 you say to listen to what people want to say when they want to say it i think thats a great goal but in reality it might not be fair to everyone else in a dental practice the team must understand that the good of the patient is the most immediate need and that they may have to wait to talk later
2784924 i also think that giving guidance and giving orders are two very different things i have a 19 year old assistant on staff she needs guidance every day right now
2784925 we want to make sure that you have a comfortable experience today please tell us if you are experiencing any discomfort of if you need a rest

2784944 just two old time things that people have kind of forgotten about
2784945 the purpose of the mount auburn street historic district is which began on the banks of the charles river in the early 1600s
2784946 in this photograph and in the dramatic seascapes that followed and that won him international renown le gray used a new technique the glass plate negative and the albumen silver print to achieve a limpid atmosphere extreme clarity of detail and flawless surface
2784947 it is my deepest wish that photography instead of falling within the domain of industry of commerce will be included among the arts that is its sole true place and it is in that direction that i shall always endeavor to guide it
2784948 if i were with you i would rub your head
2784949 your blog is always sharp and punchy makes me wonder who are you in non blog life
2784950 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshipping here in beijing china
2784951 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2784952 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2784953 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2784954 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2784955 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2784956 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2784957 a person with a blue heart is an emotional person such people make affectionate lovers are usually sensitive and are cautious drivers they are introspective reflective and have a primary concern for self
2784958 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2784959 we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2784960 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2784961 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2784962 tang has no criminal record his neighbors said they hadnt seen any abnormal behavior from him before he left hangzhou
2784963 today stopped firing in the south ossetian conflict zone and is ready to begin talks with russia on a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities
2784964 there are indications that exchanges of fire are continuing and the georgian forces have not been fully withdrawn from the conflict zone
2784965 the conflict has caused civilian casualties and more are at risk
2784966 it is essential that humanitarian agencies be able to reach the affected and the displaced
2784967 its food that people would actually want to eat and better than the sort of brunch youd go to with your parents
2784968 this one is a good mix of handmade photo textures n computer i think its representative of my philosophy
2784969 los resultados tienen que ser respetados y este resultado va a permitir que haya un nuevo escenario pol tico estoy convencido que a partir desde ma ana seguramente despu s de escuchar el ltimo informe de la corte nacional electoral habr un gran reencuentro de nuestros pueblos para seguir profundizando el proceso de cambios
2784970 s lo pido que participe el pueblo en esta fiesta democracia
2784971 en la tarde habr una una reuni n y despu s de la evaluaci n posiblemente ya de noche intentemos un mensaje al pa s viendo algunos resultados preliminares
2784972 que no resuelven los problemas sociales los problemas econ micos de las mayor as
2784973 well it seems we have a small problem on your part
2784974 my name is frosty j and my wife jo and i just leave over yonder
2784975 just frosty would be fine you can drop the j and i am here to inform you that i hit your goat
2784976 actually i hit your goat real hard and knock him off the road i know youre new in these parts but i think that the next goat you get you should probably keep him tied up even though i know goats dont stay tied up very well i could possibly help build you a pen but i felt it the neighbor thing to do was tell you that goats do not belong in the road
2784977 frosty thank you for coming to tell me this about the goat and all however i am sad to say or maybe not sad to say but i dont own a goat i dont own any animals yet
2784978 well ok then it looks like you dont have as big as problem as i thought you did can you come for dinner than jo makes a mean beef stew and an even better homemade apple pie
2784979 i have written a lot about corporate crime over the years and i used to say but i wont say it anymore that it is a misconception that white collar crime starts with the top level executive sitting and pointing at an underling and saying lets go break the law but boy was i wrong you look at these tapes its indisputable that that is exactly what was happening
2784980 we used to joke at one point in the case that if you saw a group of middle aged white males with grey hair getting together in a hotel in the middle of the day no good could come from that
2784981 it is very difficult to say when this is going to stop
2784982 there is less material being emitted but the volcano could reactivate at any moment
2784983 the volcano is part of nature and this part of southern chile is full of volcanoes
2784984 i am not afraid of the volcano and neither is my family we came back to work to reconstruct our house and our town we are hopeful that our town will live on
2784985 i can probably get out there but i wont be to my normal self like i know i can and thats what i want to accomplish
2784986 i mean why wouldnt everybody want that for me i would think everybody would be a lot happier when im 100 percent i know my quarterback would be so i dont see why theres a problem
2784987 the reassignment of gender for those who are complete in terms of gender
2784988 ensure that everyone can live in his her correct gender
2784989 still prohibits sex change for those who are already in their original gender
2784990 hey medium this is your cousin marvin marvin cool you know that new sound youve been lookin for well listen to this
2784991 previous studies have been limited to certain states and fail to distinguish the states with partial coverage from those with no legislation
2784992 our focus was not limited to a single state or a single change we looked at effects in states that went from universal helmet laws to partial laws and states that went from partial laws to no laws and states which kept their laws in place we highlighted repeals of laws in six states by using separate variables to distinguish the effects of universal and partial coverage we included controls for temperature precipitation per capita alcohol consumption income age population density and other traffic safety policies
2784993 the federal government has pressured states to adopt universal helmet laws but the trend has been toward more state control of helmet laws
2784994 the national highway traffic safety administration promotes the effectiveness of helmet laws for getting motorcyclists to wear helmets but there is no strategy for encouraging states to maintain or adopt universal coverage laws this does not bode well for the future of universal helmet laws and motorcycle safety in the united states
2784995 advocates in many states are pushing to repeal state universal helmet laws or impose partial mandates that require only young riders to wear helmets
2784996 oh i know what that is lets find something more interesting
2784997 maybe you should say something to him do you want to yell at him or would you like me to
2784998 most of jds layoffs we hope will be transferred to the other mills things are going to be a little bit tough for the families but theyll get through it
2784999 the timing couldnt be worse with the state of the economy in general
2785000 for a lot of people this is going to be real ugly
2785001 the best time of year here is winter because theres a third of the people here
2785002 when i was a kid you could go on vacation for a week and leave the keys on the seat of your car with the windows down and doors unlocked and it would still be there since more tourists have come here four wheelers are getting stolen gear is stolen right out of your rig
2785003 i guess things move on but i dont like it
2785004 if my daughter walks down the street backward i know about it
2785005 if we dont have change were going to miss out
2785006 because im a business owner i can say that but im not sure everyone would agree
2785007 id say that anyone who wants to make a living would say that as well
2785008 the town itself it was a great place to raise the kids a lot of good positive hardworking people
2785009 theres nothing to hold them here like silverwood theme park in coeur dalene
2785010 i hope someone buys the restaurant and does something with it that can make money because right now its not i think it would be a great mechanics shop
2785011 ive been married 28 years and always lived in the same place
2785012 my father was the same way he was a logger and thats all he ever did he lived in the same house his whole life
2785013 n o estamos sabendo disso e acho que o saber amos se fosseverdade

2785018 i cant tell you how frustrating it is to hear people belittle diabetes because its maintainable everybody on our team is on full alert watching every move nick makes on that stage every single night of his life
2785019 yes being in the audience is one thing you should try being in the other direction when its coming at you
2785020 people seriously ask us all the time are you guys really brothers
2785021 its like no we named our band jonas brothers just for fun
2785022 its funny when you find out there are other celebrities with crushes on you like when i read that lauren conrad from the hills liked me
2785023 we were neighbours when we were on tour together it was good just really close but it would crack me up i would read these stories online people saying things that were completely untrue
2785024 i admire the jonas brothers because their songs speak to people theyre not just normal songs they have a meaning each song has a different story behind it and that is true music

2785049 its part of being on the team its not punishment its more of a team unity thing i told eric from day 1 that unless i pass out im going to try to do everything that everyone else does im not different aside from being a little gray headed and a little bit older tony richardson and i combined have 33 years that counts for something but ultimately its about the team is it to get in shape no is it a punishment no its a reminder of how important the team is
2785050 the crowd was cheering and all of that stuff im not embarrassed by running a lap i think its kind of funny but yet it serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2785051 brett had his two hard boiled eggs a little bit of orange juice there was a garnish i think and some hash browns

2785080 as a practising gp in a deprived area of north london i know that the cost of prescriptions can put some people off getting the medicines they need we talk about there being an inverse care law which says the more health care a person needs the less they get in the uk and here is another example no well off person would think twice abut paying for the medicines they need the less well off who often have more frequent need for medicines will be the group that think twice about filling the prescription their gp has given them the government talks a lot about reducing the gap between the health of the poorest in society and the better off prescription charges can be just one more barrier and so should go unpopular as we are told it may be raising general taxation is a much better and healthier way to generate money for the nhs the labour government is not popular at the moment supporting the nhs instead of privatising it and helping people who are ill to pay for their medicines would reassert the principles and values of the nhs that the majority of the public still uphold and would be a tonic to us all

2785082 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2785083 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2785084 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2785085 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2785086 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2785087 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2785088 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2785089 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2785090 we played the race card from the bottom of the deck
2785091 hey when we accuse him of playing the race card lets quote the oj trial
2785092 well i guess obama isnt going to be such a great progressive liberal hope after all
2785093 every expenditure has been in the context of fighting poverty
2785094 its very important for unions not to do this kind of thing
2785095 union leadership is a public trust all the more so when the people being represented are among the lowest paid in america
2785096 as far as i can determine the international union has not received allegations concerning freemans local if the international union receives allegations about a local that warrant further action we have internal union procedures for handling them
2785097 any money that was left over after paying staff and expenses went back into the company

2785108 if obama was a white man he would not be in this position
2785109 and if he was a woman of any color he would not be in this position he happens to be very lucky to be who he is and the country is caught up in the concept
2785110 er worden veel projecten ontwikkeld maar er is nog wel een hoop werk te doen om er draagvlak in de maatschappij voor te krijgen
2785111 i stood at the doctors side and watched him perform a partial birth abortion on a woman who was six months pregnant the babys heartbeat was clearly visible on the ultrasound screen the doctor delivered the babys body and arms everything but his little head the babys body was moving his little fingers were clasping together he was kicking his feet the doctor took a pair of scissors and inserted them into the back of the babys head and the babys arms jerked out in a flinch a startle reaction like a baby does when he thinks that he might fall then the doctor opened the scissors up then he stuck the high powered suction tube into the hole and sucked the babys brains out now the baby was completely limp i never went back to the clinic but i am still haunted by the face of that little boy it was the most perfect angelic face i have ever seen
2785112 ik ben zeer ge nteresseerd in dit onderwerp en vindt het dan ook belangrijk dat er goede voorzieningen zijn en dat er voldoende opties zijn voor deze net niet kinderen

2785125 the organizers of orange county chose that name for the sordid purpose of real estate
2785126 they argued that eastern people would be attracted by the name and would rush to that county to buy orange ranches forgetful or perhaps ignorant of the fact that there were more than a hundred other places in the united states named orange
2785127 indeed the divine hand has been lavish in bestowing upon all southern california and upon orange county in particular rare natural advantages perhaps greater than those enjoyed by any other section over which the flag floats our climate is faultless in fact it is not too much to say that as to fertility of soil the charming climate and the scenery with its grandeur and beauty it is not surpassed the world around

2785129 victory or defeat was not the issue i am elated we could draw the attention of people across the state to our struggle against the sez
2785130 we did not receive even half of the compensation that the government announced officials at every level from the village to the district took commissions bribes and we ended up with paltry amounts
2785131 we used to cultivate dry crops such as maize wheat pulses and oilseeds in our one acre of land for other essentials we used to do labour occasionally
2785132 since we dont have land anymore we now are compelled to work as labourers throughout the year
2785133 we had in fact initially thought we will field 150 farmers but we couldnt collect the rs7 5 lakh required for security deposits
2785134 ever since we announced our decision to contest the elections leaders of key political parties threatened us even election commission officials harassed us by slapping notices on us for not submitting the details of our poll expenditure
2785135 we are now left with loans of around rs78 500
2785136 we are willing to give back whatever compensation we received
2785137 we want the government to give back the balance 900 acres to the farmers and extend better compensation package to them
2785138 let apiic pay to farmers the difference between the cost of acquisition of land from farmers and the cost at which the land was sold to the companies in the sez

2785140 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
2785141 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
2785142 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
2785143 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business
2785144 were so very satisfied to be at 40 million plus after five days you couldnt ask for more
2785145 we congratulate the caretaker government and its all advisers for declaring 15 august as national mourning day and a public holiday in line with the high court verdict
2785146 so the election commission is in favour of not sending the proposal for amending upazila parishad ordinance to the caretaker government
2785147 we however dont want to be blamed for any such step
2785148 we couldnt hold council there due to the state of emergency we call on the government to lift the emergency to allow party councils for the sake of democracy
2785149 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got these cold chills
2785150 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool

2785153 khaleda zia will be released without any condition the process for her release has reached the final stage
2785154 we are determined but we do not want to talk about any date
2785155 the process of releasing tarique also senior joint secretary general of bnp is underway like his younger brother arafat rahman koko he is also expected to leave the country straightaway for medical treatment
2785156 she khaleda may leave the country within a couple of days of her release to perform umrah
2785157 the advisers are saying that her release is in the final stage but the party has not been informed of the matter
2785158 i first encountered musharraf when he acted as turkish interpreter during visits by turkey military i declined to make him my military secretary we initially refused his promotion his promotion because of his suspected links with mqm the final time i recall meeting with him was the most important when in 1996 he presented to me a war scenario for kashmir
2785159 a friend of benazir bhuttos husband asif zardari came to call on me his name was javed pasha i had never seen him before pasha suggested that i become benazirs military secretary but i rejected pashas suggestion had i become her military secretary i would have gone down with her and her government

2785166 the election commission should hold the election again at least it should arrange re election in controversial polling centres 18 19 31 36 57 and 79 the same goes for polling centres 25 26 27 28 29 and 30 as hiron complained about these centres
2785167 it should take half an hour at most to take the result to the election office from any centre in the city but surprisingly it took about eight hours to announce results of a number of the polling centres
2785168 my opponent has been made winner by rigging the polls and manipulation in the vote counting
2785169 real irregularities and rigging have taken place in the election office
2785170 the result of the election has been changed only to defeat me even 2 500 of the 3 100 votes shown as cancelled were valid and cast for me

2785177 were being driven away the place was in flames and we couldnt stay
2785178 this reminds me all too much of other recent conflicts that have torn our continent apart particularly in the balkans
2785179 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2785180 we have asked united states secretary of state condoleezza rice to mediate with the russians to transmit them our message

2785190 musharraf should step down before the start of the impeachment proceedings because the country cannot afford confrontation any more
2785191 the president should avail the opportunity to make an honourable exit
2785192 it will be a historic motion it will have solid points against musharraf
2785193 the charge sheet will be solid and musharraf will not be able to fight it
2785194 musharraf still has time it will be in his own interest if he resigns
2785195 we have far beyond the two thirds majority he should realise this
2785196 it is the responsibility of the state to ensure quality primary education for all why does the government allow non government organisation brac that has no experience in formal education to supervise all primary schools in 20 upazilas

2785229 we have been approached maybe we will start it on our own first we will see if they can help in sourcing programming at lower cost and sourcing of set top box that are cheaper then we will see
2785230 everything has gone down the price of the equipment the uplink and downlink and the price of set top boxes have gone down significantly in the past few years it looks like the economics have changed for dth the overall economic feasibility has changed
2785231 you can have that one we got it for free at a garage sale but it hurts my knee
2785232 we are doing good with our direct selling business in fact its our main growth driver now
2785233 we are also looking at having 100 to 200 distribution centers in the next three to five years business is particularly strong in rural areas like antique iligan cagayan de oro and samar we discovered that theres buying power in the countryside the market remains untapped
2785234 once we have 100 to 200 distribution centers we may consider reviving the plant we can produce high quality products here
2785235 it is in progress and hopefully before the year ends we will launch it for now we own 100 percent of the venture

2785255 external factors especially oil and the dow jones us stock market may also continue to affect the direction of the psei philippine stock exchange index
2785256 the dow is still highly volatile given its weak housing and financial markets the dow is still unpredictable
2785257 though some local companies had modest growth more had weaker gains as they were badly hit by rising costs of operations
2785258 the big factor on a day to day basis is oil
2785259 they did not report any slowdown perhaps due to the quality of their projects and their track record

2785261 as of today most of the city tskhinvali is controlled by russian peacekeeping forces
2785262 weve arrested quite a number of very serious criminals individuals who frankly have worn out their welcome by coming into this country illegally and committing more crimes when they got here
2785263 a group of men who love jesus and love to ride hard we are not your normal motorcycle club some say we are too good for the bad guys and too bad for the good guys
2785264 all we soldiers know is that we take care of our own and help plenty of others along the way we try to live right in this wrong world and let our light shine wherever we may go
2785265 its supposed to be a sober living place but theyre always at the liquor store buying beer theyre running their motorcycles all night long they own three or four houses up and down the street
2785266 they were always the hometown airline they were in the downtown parades they invested in the community
2785267 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2785268 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts
2785269 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about
2785270 the more you raise fees the more you drive airlines and customers away
2785271 its rhetoric ive heard for 41 years but i understand
2785272 these folks arent sure if theyre going to be in business in six months
2785273 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
2785274 the main source of support for the u s economy in recent quarters has been the strength of net exports
2785275 but the world economy has fallen off the edge of a cliff
2785276 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2785277 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2785278 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2785279 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2785280 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2785281 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2785282 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2785283 i would like you to write a simple story just once more my father says the kind maupassant wrote or chekhov the kind you used to write

2785286 oh sure they pay me all right howd you guess they pay me with a couple of hours of their valuable time they tell me their troubles and why theyre divorced and separated and they let me make dinner once in a while
2785287 mom you have to get them out of there its your mother and father its your responsibility
2785288 i consider it a privilege to recognize the efforts of these outstanding members of our community these men and women in law enforcement and fire protection our friends and family have dedicated their lives to providing safety and security for us and i am pleased to honor them and to give our community a chance to publicly acknowledge their contributions
2785289 thank you and god bless to all of our first responders
2785290 our community owes a sincere debt of gratitude to these men and women who put their lives on the line everyday
2785291 by paying tribute to these outstanding individuals we make ourselves a better caring community i am truly pleased to see so many members of our community come out to recognize these first responders and to say thank you for their selfless dedication to our safety
2785292 there is almost no way we can imagine a return to the status quo
2785293 we dont feel there has been any decline in the numbers of people tried and sentenced to death
2785294 it is simply unfair for any patient to receive an excessive and surprise medical bill
2785295 it is unconscionable that low income families are exposed to aggressive tactics threats to their credit and improper and coercive billing practices designed to intimidate them into making excessive payments they are not obligated to pay
2785296 families enrolled in these two programs are in low to moderate income working families already struggling to make ends meet
2785297 they should never be charged more than their co pay just because through no fault of their own they ended up with an out of network radiologist or anesthesiologist
2785298 getting my 100 was not an issue i just wanted to keep going for the team keep pushing the score along of course its disappointing but that really wasnt the issue
2785299 ideally we should have got a 250 lead so we fell a bit short but the ball is doing a bit and if the bowlers hit their stride tomorrow we can win this
2785300 i cant wait i just want to go out and have fun
2785301 by singing in harmony from the same page of the same investing hymnal the diehards drown out market noise
2785302 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2785303 i opened this store about a year ago business has been ok now i dont know how im going to afford to fix it up
2785304 i dont think this incident could lead to the conclusion that their capabilities have increased because even an extremely small number of people could draw enormous media attention
2785305 last monday two attackers killed 16 border police in the xinjiang city of kashgar near the pakistan afghan border no one claim responsibility
2785306 i heard some bombs and then i heard some machine guns

2785308 any olympic athlete aspiring to a gold medal in beijing would do well to visit the emperors sunrise and carry the spirit of the jade to the field of contest
2785309 jade has been has been more than a decorative stone it has been the definitive metaphor for the very fabric of chinese culture an icon of excellence and virtue often described as the stone of heaven this historical connection to jade was somewhat obscured in the years of the tumultuous birth of the peoples republic but by the fitting decision to adorn the 2008 olympic gold medals with a jade inlay the connection has been jarred awake the decision was fitting because chinese tradition holds that an adornment of jade represents fine and noble excellence to be properly bestowed upon the worthiest of the worthy
2785310 there is an innate potency abiding within the heart of every fine piece of jade the emperors sunrise in particular radiates a positive energy that is fairly palpable any person who would visit the emperor as pratt calls it should look closely just above the centre on the polished face there one will see a tiny glowing eye from this eye emanates the power within the stone any who would touch it as long as their mind is open will at once be suffused with the dynamism from within if the supplicant be an olympic athlete they will go to their competition with an invincible connection to the gold they seek to all canadian athletes i say go to the emperor it is close by you in the heart of beijing touch the eye the power within will come upon you like a talisman carry it with you and do well in olympic competition
2785311 vi kan f en skole hvor det er viktig kunne gangetabellen

2785314 olive oil is a rapidly growing industry in california with volume projected to increase by 1000 percent in the next five years california also produces 99 9 of the olive oil grown in the u s
2785315 but state law does not define olive oil grades and as a result the grades commonly seen on olive oil bottles such as extra virgin don t need to meet any standards
2785316 sb 634 establishes new definitions that meet international standards and requires that bottles of olive oil be labeled accordingly this will help consumers make informed choices based on consistent standards for quality
2785317 provide consumers with better information facilitate the increased export of california olive oils and help spur adoption of national standards
2785318 had a good time with you today theres just one more thing i wanna do before you leave
2785319 property owners are already facing great challenges given the current market climate the possibility of being victimized by predatory escrow agents notwithstanding
2785320 expanding escrow license examinations under ab 2323 to also include information from the fbi for any federal convictions or arrests allows californians to rest assured that their escrow agents do not have criminal backgrounds ab 2323 is a public safety imperative and i am proud to see it signed
2785321 the fact that the governor now has said we cannot balance this budget we cannot get through the next three or four years without at least a temporary tax i think is a step in the right direction
2785322 i m glad that he stepped up to this but let s be clear he doesn t have any support in his own party yet for this and unless he can get republicans to agree with his point of view we could be here for an extended period of time
2785323 they republicans are very narrow about what they want to discuss and even more narrow on the things they re willing to agree to so we are now at loggerheads this is an impasse there are no four way discussions going on any longer because there are no solutions here
2785324 people have asked why don t we put ours budget up for a vote and we may well have to everybody might say well that s a drill except for the fact we are 35 days overdue and there is no end in sight and we are going to have to go out and borrow some very expensive money
2785325 i have told everybody that if they want to spend one weekend or the other in denver go right ahead but don t plan to be there for the democratic national convention i don t see this ending for quite sometime
2785326 the governor also wants automatic midterm authority cuts well we re not going to do that you don t get to go to hawaii and have these things take care of themselves if you are going to have any cutting authority at all you re going to have to pull the trigger but you re not going to do it around the legislature i don t care if the democrats or republicans are in the majority you can t take us constitutionally out of the process of approving expenditures that s what they want to do and we won t do that it s just simply not the way three branches of government work
2785327 they republicans have a huge list of we don t like ems but they have not brought anything up they said they want a hard spending cap there is no proposal they say they want to borrow and they only come up with 3 or 4 billion to close an 8 billion gap so everything they want to do they have refused or failed to provide a proposal
2785328 all during the budget hearings all during the conference committee they never once proposed any alternative to the budget so the burden is really now on them if they want to let the great state of california slide into arkansas that s going to be on them but they have got to come up with proposals and they have not done it
2785329 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2785330 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2785331 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2785332 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2785333 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2785334 i applaud the governor for signing this legislation which puts patients in charge of their end of life care decisions
2785335 my legislation ensures that unlike advance health care directives and do not resuscitate orders polst forms will carry the weight of a doctor s order meaning that it must be followed across all health care settings including long term care facilities and emergency rooms by all health care providers including physicians nurses and emergency medical personnel that s the primary reason the polst process is the best way for patients to ensure their wishes are honored
2785336 i know from personal experience how critical it is for a patient s treatment preferences to be clearly conveyed and easily accessible to health care providers a person s decisions relating to their end of life care are among the most important they ll ever make this new law will ensure that those decisions are honored by all health care providers
2785337 i look forward to continuing to work with the healthcare community to see the polst process utilized to benefit patients throughout california
2785338 california is one of only two states that do not allow drivers to place portable gps devices on their windshields
2785339 despite this fact many californians have placed them on their windshields anyway by using mounts that come prepackaged with the device
2785340 we are already on pace to exceed the goal of a 7 reduction in greenhouse gases set by the kyoto protocol
2785341 with the aggressive policies and initiatives being put forth by my administration we can continue to move towards our goal of 20 reduction by 2012
2785342 san francisco s community inventory methodology goes above and beyond most current community inventories in the united states these efforts are impressive given the inherent complexities and challenges in producing a community wide inventory and the lack of a widely accepted and standard community wide inventory protocol
2785343 today we recognize san francisco as a true leader and innovator on climate protection and part of an elite group of cities driving action and inspiring others
2785344 from green building standards and their commitment to recycling and waste reduction san francisco illustrates the power of a local government to proactively address global warming while enhancing the community
2785345 i am honored to receive this award from afscme local 3299 who s over 20 000 members represent the heart and soul of the university of california
2785346 as the cost of education continues to rise and uc workers continue to fight for a fair contract and voice on their pensions our work is far from complete my hope is to continue the strong working relationship with the men and women of afscme local 3299 to restore access to higher education and equity in compensation and representation within the university system
2785347 assemblymember portantino has shown true leadership as chair of the assembly higher education committee
2785348 this law will help prevent hackers from attempting to alter the outcome of elections
2785349 after the number of voting irregularities over the last decade californians need to feel confident that their votes will not be tampered with
2785350 not all parents are aware of the many services offered at these schools and that they may be the most suitable option for their children
2785351 this bill makes sure parents or the guardians are informed when their children are assessed for an individualized education program
2785352 in the field research poll there is striking public support for a paid sick days law
2785353 voters were quite sophisticated in their understanding that paid sick days are not only a workplace issue but also a measure to protect the public s health 81 agree that guaranteeing paid sick day laws to all restaurant workers who handle food would increase the chances that workers would stay home when they get sick and not infect the public
2785354 democrats republicans and independents are united in support of paid sick days
2785355 people are not robots and voters understand that the benefits to public health far outweigh the cost
2785356 californians are ready for the governor and legislators to move past the partisan gridlock and improve the state s public health
2785357 health impact assessment of the california healthy families healthy workplaces act
2785358 our research finds that this legislation would be a commonsense policy that would protect the health of all californians
2785359 it is important for policymakers to see paid sick days not only as a labor policy but as a sensible and effective public health policy and it is important for policymakers to fix the disconnect between known best practices to prevent disease and current sick day laws and systems
2785360 california does not have a budget crisis california has a leadership crisis
2785361 when we abandon the backbone of california s workforce and castigate them for the budget woes we are relinquishing our leadership
2785362 our california families are already suffering the effects of a homeownership crisis and the economy the governor s cuts to innocent state workers are exacerbating this situation why should they suffer their salaries are not even a significant percentage of the state budget and will have no impact on solving the budget crisis
2785363 instead of brokering a bipartisan compromise to this budget crisis the governor has begun shutting down state government
2785364 thousands of californians who need health care will now go without attention creating longer lines at emergency rooms and greater problems and expenses down the road
2785365 i expect the governor to sign this bill into law as has consistently supported our efforts to make sure true freedom of the press is alive and well on our campuses
2785366 allowing a school administration to censor in any way is contrary to the democratic process and the ability of a student newspaper to serve as the watchdog and bring sunshine to the actions of school administrators it is quite disheartening to hear that after we specifically prohibited prior restraint by administrators that some are engaging in this type of nefarious activity and even firing quality teachers because of content in the student newspaper
2785367 in a span of four months they all but stripped me of my professional existence
2785368 since administrators are unable by law to exercise prior restraint with regard to a student publication they lean on advisers to do what they legally cannot
2785369 when advisers refuse they are punished because administrators know they will face no legal consequences sb 1370 is necessary to close this gaping loophole in the law
2785370 es gibt keinerlei anzeichen dass die tat gezielt gegen us b rger gerichtet war es war eine kriminelle einzeltat

2785372 jetzt haben sich alle wieder in ihre h user verzogen
2785373 hier passiert jetzt absolut gar nichts mehr keine stimme man h rt nichts
2785374 this is exactly the kind of deceptive lobbying tactic that i ve been fighting since the day i arrived in the legislature it s toxic to the political process
2785375 these mailers are grossly misleading and fail to even mention the most basic facts about this legislation that it applies only to food and beverage containers designed for consumption by infants we are talking about babies and toddlers less than three years old i m not willing to gamble on their health not when there are studies showing potential for great harm and there are proven safe alternatives
2785376 when people call my office concerned we tell them the whole story
2785377 we tell them who paid for the mailer and what the bill is really about once they hear the facts most change their position and many are angry and annoyed at the chemistry council for misleading them
2785378 i will be supporting the bill when it comes to a vote in the assembly as i hope my colleagues will we need to send a strong message that this type of misleading lobbying tactic is not rewarded
2785379 two years ago i authored legislation ab 2974 to require these corporate lobbying campaigns to identify themselves and publicly disclose their expenditures so at least the public would know who was behind them and how much they were spending not surprisingly that legislation was killed by these same corporate lobbyists i ve concluded the best way to stop them is just to vote against them when they use this tactic if it stops working they ll stop doing it

2785382 if we want to get serious about addressing the root causes of global warming then let s draw down the empty rhetoric and start taking concrete actions
2785383 a lot of people don t realize that their homes and businesses create a significant portion of our carbon footprint so today by signing these strict green building standards into law we re saying enough is enough let s end the stale promises emphasize conservation and tackle climate change on all fronts

2785396 our findings are particularly relevant for neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinsons and alzheimers
2785397 many of these diseases are due to misbehaving or damaged proteins that accumulate in neurons by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
2785398 that was enough to maintain a clean liver and to prove that if you keep your cells clean they work better
2785399 now that we know that repairing that defect is enough to restore a system to its youth we will start screening compounds
2785400 in light of the enormous improvement that we observed my opinion is that repairing other systems will have a similar effect

2785424 we arrived at the hospital at 2 30 and brody was dead by 5 30 in the morning
2785425 i think a lot parents know their children are protected but fail to realize there are other strains
2785426 this disease is spread through saliva like sucking on the same water bottle as one of your teammates
2785427 there are a lot decisions that go into a publicly funded program and there are only so many health care dollars available
2785428 had we known the vaccine was available we would have made private arrangements to have brody covered
2785429 no other kid in the province should die from this devastating disease
2785430 no other parents should suffer the tragedy that my wife and i have suffered and will likely suffer the rest of our lives

2785438 she used to be a real party girl when she wasnt out at nightclubs she was taking acting classes we dated for only a few months but in that period i spent a lot of time with her and her friends whose behavior intrigued and appalled me to such an extent that i ended up basing a novel on the experience it was narrated in the first person from the point of view of an ostensibly jaded sexually voracious 20 year old who was inspired by lisa i certainly thought of alison poole as a sympathetic and ultimately endearing character

2785478 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2785479 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2785480 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2785481 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2785482 this was a heinous attack by al qaeda in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2785483 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2785484 al qaeda is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here

2785513 my last at bat when i was running to first after i ran i didnt feel anything but then i started feeling a little tightness in my groin
2785514 this was a day he was not going to play hes 36 years old and most times day games after night games he probably wont be in the lineup i think he could play if we needed him but hes not in the starting lineup today im sure hell be ok to play tomorrow
2785515 hes one of the guys that takes the ball all the time and its paying dividends for him
2785516 the more he gets out there the better he can be consistently with his mechanics and delivery and things like that it could make him very effective
2785517 he was in the strike zone with a little bit more life on his pitches
2785518 sanchez when he has that he really has a presence about him and hes a very confident individual sometimes thats half the battle in those late innings is having confidence
2785519 i havent really given him what i feel might be the best opportunities for him but thats the nature sometimes of the big leagues when youre in a pennant race
2785520 theres times when you cant afford to take a look there are always games that you could get people in regardless but it just hasnt arisen for him on a consistent basis
2785521 whether its long relief or short relief ill be ready to take the ball
2785522 physically he has been through a lot of adversity and we talked about that when we talked to him its not ever a fun decision to make but in reference to whats best for the team and whats fair based on baseball performance hes the odd guy out
2785523 in the big picture he was just the 13th man on a 14 man staff
2785524 i think he was doing some positive things that are going to help him in the future but not quick enough here and not often enough and i do think the injury obviously didnt help the situation missing all that time
2785525 i dont say that thats not good especially if you cant take the pounding
2785526 he ran the whole game line to line the entire game and everybody wondered why he went 300 innings he ran
2785527 these cats would leave out before batting practice running up in the hills around dodger stadium and they wouldnt come back until the end of bp
2785528 i tell little kids to run how many little kids do you see running
2785529 first thing your momma hollered quit running quit running through the house that kid that runs is going to be somebody
2785530 you never know when or how its gonna happen but youll definitely take it
2785531 i think any minor leaguer would agree with that youll take it any way you can get it
2785532 its a small ballpark in charlotte and i was just giving them up just throwing the ball over the middle of the plate too much
2785533 we know the problem so its a little easier to fix i felt fine and its not mechanical just where youre throwing the pitch it was as simple as that
2785534 no position is easy but for the most part im pretty confident in all of them
2785535 this kid has a chance to be here for a few years
2785536 i like the way he plays i like the way he does stuff so do the minor league people the coaches out there really like him and hopefully he can help with what we need
2785537 ozzie didnt really know much of me so you know my goal in spring training was to maybe catch his eye a little bit
2785538 and i went out and had a decent year to be in the mix for a potential callup
2785539 simviation free site simviation members site site map site search i have downloaded scenery of the island of alderney channel islands all is well except that the trees near the airport buildings all have black square back ground
2785540 oh i dont have one mommy thought you wanted that for your own personal gain
2785541 we agreed personal terms on friday and if all goes well he will sign on monday
2785542 hes a player whos the right age and who well need
2785543 hes made a commitment to portsmouth and hell be a very good acquisition
2785544 hes at the right age hell learn from playing alongside sol campbell hell gain that experience that all players need and hopefully hell be the player were looking for
2785545 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2785546 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2785547 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2785548 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2785549 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2785550 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2785551 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2785552 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2785553 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2785554 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this

2785560 that particular coat it also seems to me is quite often worn by people of a genuinely courteous and warm sort who are nevertheless at times driven by a powerfully kinetic internal combustion the momentum of which can sometimes be of such strength as to run over others but without malicious intent being the result of an oft time powerful quest that though certainly quite personal is not necessarily egotistical
2785561 its the one form of music that was consistently in my world from the beginning
2785562 i still sing those songs i dont think i could separate what i do from that type of music even on this record even though its plugged in and has certain rock influences on some songs lyrically and in terms of what i try to do musically theres no separating me from that i still aim with my music for the response that those church songs evoked in my family and myself and the people around me
2785563 people seem to have a hard time defining what i do
2785564 when i first started people called it folk music and others called it bluegrass ive heard country and now im hearing rock with this record its all of those influences involved in what ive become it seems like a natural thing
2785565 i left the church and dropped out of school when i was seventeen but i didnt pursue it i had other jobs and did non musical things id come home at night and play the piano singing for myself
2785566 i suddenly realized that i had become pretty unhappy and that i wasnt enjoying any of these other things that i was trying to do
2785567 i made a conscious decision to stop running from the thing that i loved and just do it even if nobody liked it even if it got me nowhere even if everybody laughed at my songs i was going to write them and i was going to go out to sing them
2785568 that class did a lot to stimulate me creatively and had a lot to do with why i went into writing songs
2785569 the teacher was really good she didnt dwell on your structure or your misspellings even though she would point that out but if you had a good creative idea she would get really excited she seemed to truly enjoy that when a student would find things i thrived on that
2785570 i sat down one day and decided that i wanted to write a song
2785571 i decided to stop worrying about everybody else and what they would think about it and write for me after one you write songs forever for some reason that day i managed to get a verse and chorus and another verse it was just amazing for somebody who could never write more than one line i was in heaven i just kept going from there
2785572 one more sangat berat about our relationship tepatnya tentang kelanjutannya
2785573 panpan tahu kan kalo bo sayang ma panpan sangat begitu juga sebaliknya bo yakin kalo panpan sayang ma bo tapi

2785579 in kindergarten i was told by his teacher michael cant sit still michael cant be quiet michael cant focus
2785580 i am very shocked i cannot see if we should live in this area any more it is a tough area but convenient for the university as chinese students we do not have any affairs with other people i want to know why this happened sometimes local children attack us i dont know whether it is because we come from another country
2785581 they have not been here for long and they just kept themselves to themselves
2785582 listen i am telling you a mystery we will not all fall asleep but we will all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised incorruptible and we will be changed
2785583 for the lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout with the archangels voice and with the trumpet of god and the dead in christ will rise first then we who are still alive will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so we will always be with the lord

2785588 i thought we could have won it sometimes you win sometimes you lose they came back they hit a great shot give them credit
2785589 if you consider this loss its not that important but its emotionally important it puts a lot of pressure on you in the next game and the following one so were going to have to play great and really step up
2785590 it was great we won the game we really feel good about that but there is still a long way to go
2785591 we cant get too rattled in the beginning with good streaks
2785592 if we get worried it wont help us we have to keep that in mind from here on out
2785593 everyone is proud it felt great all the flags and people cheering it was a great game great atmosphere
2785594 it was tough in the beginning but we managed to improve and get the win
2785595 we played very good defense and forced them to lose many balls that was the key to our victory it will help give us confidence
2785596 it was a great game a very important game for us
2785597 it was our defense and the running game those were the keys to the win
2785598 we missed a lot of free throws and we made some easy mistakes that made it easy for spain to control the game were going to try the next game not to give that present
2785599 it was a good start we had a little pressure on us but overall it went pretty well
2785600 will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations

2785608 we cant do that you have to just recognize that were going to go through down cycles and up cycles
2785609 theres going to be another million people here in the next 10 years
2785610 i was attracted to this area for the peace and solitude but peace and solitude no longer exists with 80 000 people living a mile from me
2785611 they said they were going to use desert plants and all this but the first thing they did was to put in huge palm trees that take so much water just to announce their arrival
2785612 were not yet condo on condo neighbor on neighbor with five foot easements i mean its going to come but its not here today
2785613 theres going to be growth here no matter what its just how we handle it
2785614 all that soil out there are plants that grew 6 000 years ago and didnt decompose completely
2785615 thats what peat is so were just making the same thing happen that happened here for millennia
2785616 we were capturing a lot of c02 at levels much greater than other systems marshes and forests grasslands
2785617 they can just sit back and watch the tules grow and they should be making money
2785618 thats what the vision is its not to do it just on twitchell island its to see if we can do it throughout the delta on subsided land
2785619 when oxygen is limited the bugs the microbes have to eat and breathe somehow
2785620 they will use sulfate iron or some other compound instead of producing c02 at the end of the pathway they end up producing methane
2785621 you probably wont be able to replicate it everywhere because we have a long growing season and we have very specific conditions that occur in the delta that dont occur worldwide

2785624 its kind of disappointing when you talk it up and talk it up and then nothing happens
2785625 the houston area got most of the rain today two to four inches
2785626 with instability caused by the low pressure we could still see a 50 percent chance of rainfall throughout the day
2785627 the attacks by eastern turkestan terrorists have never stopped in the xinjiang region the very purpose of their attacks is all about separating the region from china and such a behavior would not be tolerated by any country in the world
2785628 of course i imagine they want to leverage the platform of the olympic games to magnify their impact
2785629 i believe their very purpose of doing all this is about separation
2785630 there were bombs that were either produced or stockpiled and there were guns involved but thats still pretty low level
2785631 were not looking at ieds buried bombs set off by cell phones as weve seen in afghanistan and iraq

2785634 in this new years honours list actor ian mckellen was honoured for his work on behalf of homosexuals a century ago oscar wilde was locked up and put in jail
2785635 from the pulpit homophobia is preached by some arrogant religious leaders who think their beliefs are superior to our inborn and some would say god given nature
2785636 the bishop of motherwell addressed his flock and told them how appalled he was that i had received an honour and that 100 years ago i would have been imprisoned like oscar wilde he feels that the roman catholic church is beleaguered in some way
2785637 we neglect the gay lobby at our peril he said
2785638 the bishop is in my view a profoundly ignorant and stupid man in his views
2785639 if he finds it offensive that gay people want to celebrate those gay people who died in the holocaust which was a large number of people then hes also profoundly unchristian
2785640 the church is shocked by how quickly attitudes have changed all churches have thrived on prejudice its a means of keeping people under their control and i think they are really shocked at how quickly the world has moved on especially as it isnt the world they would like it to be so they cite biblical incidents as being the word of god
2785641 i was certainly not saying that homosexuality is a crime which requires prison nothing of the kind
2785642 the focus was on the progress made by homosexuals rather than the suggestion that there should be any draconian laws it is all very well people in the gay lobby demanding rights but they are riding roughshod over the rights of others in the process
2785643 what i am saying is not superior its just sticking up for 2 000 years of christian values
2785644 the iraqi army has started to clear all of the area especially the hinterland that was controlled by al qaeda
2785645 we have our orders from the prime minister that people arent allowed to have heavy weapons
2785646 many of the reports have the local people saying theyre quite happy with the way the searches have gone
2785647 they were expecting very aggressive searches doors being beaten down furniture broken and things being stolen that hasnt been the case with these guys
2785648 the political consolidation among the sunnis shia and kurd is already done
2785649 here is a study that i think does find a correlation with obesity http www3 interscience wi
2785650 hi everybody its dion i now weigh 65 kilograms which means i put on 10 kilograms so im think im gonna do wat

2785652 i may have had a lot of failures but i had more fun with my failures than most people have with their successes

2785655 wally heard the cardinal raise his voice a lot of times
2785656 a lot of guys felt they got no support from the cardinal and he was sort of a lifeline
2785657 celebrated the funeral masses of deceased priests without fail unless i was out of the archdiocese or fulfilling an archdiocesan commitment that could not be changed
2785658 he was smart challenging gave great sermons but you didnt want to be on his bad side
2785659 intense relationships between faculty and students were permitted to exist both for priests and lay teachers
2785660 wally had to walk a fine line keeping people from leaving but not being critical of emmy moore
2785661 we all thought he was overdue to become a bishop
2785662 he always seemed to have the inside track but he kept just going around and around
2785663 he was always smooth but he could also be very candid
2785664 the other problem though he said was how too many innocent people innocent priests were getting swept up in these accusations
2785665 i am beyond words trying to describe how people feel about this
2785666 its always different when you know somebody but this just brings home for me what he was saying in his testimony how sometimes innocent people do get swept up
2785667 well i knew you were sick but i knew you werent dying or anything
2785668 we arrived at the hospital at 2 30 and brody was dead by 5 30 in the morning
2785669 i think a lot parents know their children are protected but fail to realize there are other strains
2785670 this disease is spread through saliva like sucking on the same water bottle as one of your teammates
2785671 there are a lot decisions that go into a publicly funded program and there are only so many health care dollars available
2785672 had we known the vaccine was available we would have made private arrangements to have brody covered
2785673 no other kid in the province should die from this devastating disease
2785674 no other parents should suffer the tragedy that my wife and i have suffered and will likely suffer the rest of our lives
2785675 we got to take out a whole kitchen with a sledge hammer
2785676 after the depression it became a popular thing to put things in the walls of houses so other people would find them some day
2785677 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2785678 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2785679 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2785680 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2785681 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2785682 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2785683 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2785684 if you visualise being stronger running faster or winning you are priming your nervous system to do just that
2785685 studies have found that the method can enhance physical performance significantly sometimes by 20 percent or more
2785686 breathing deeply imagine your headache wash away as a stream of cool blue light or fluid runs through your head dispersing the pain and calming the whole area down
2785687 any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2785688 after a bout of sex the body releases endorphins known as happy chemicals
2785689 from a physical point of view its similar to enjoying a good workout or going swimming but if youre having sex with someone you love it also makes you feel cared for and promotes self esteem
2785690 theres no doubt that sex is relaxing and so helps tackle insomnia
2785691 lots of people use sex whether with a partner or on their own as a way of getting to sleep the surge in oxytocin is a natural sedative
2785692 it is also released in people in secure relationships and during sexual contact
2785693 often when i see couples in trouble they have stopped having sex and one of them will say their partner no longer finds them attractive
2785694 we know that having a strong relationship is a good indicator of longevity and a healthy sex life is a big part of that
2785695 si beus aigua eliminar s tot el que et sobra
2785696 i wanted to sing on the medal podium but i couldnt stop crying i was just happy to get the first one under my belt
2785697 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2785698 maybe thats why it hurts so much it hit so close

2785706 i knew i was going to need a strong breaststroke when we all turned together
2785707 i knew i was going to have to overpower them
2785708 i looked up and saw president bush giving me a thumbs up and holding the american flag that was pretty cool
2785709 get some calories into my system and try to recover the best i can
2785710 i told longtime coach bob bowman that this would be my last 400 im so ive got to go out there and get a good time
2785711 im a little tired but i am happy to get my first ever olympic medal
2785712 i saw zhang next to me and i just buried my head i was hoping for gold everyone in that race was you cant complain when you get a best time
2785713 all i wanted to do was make it to tomorrow to conserve energy and make it to the final
2785714 i need to bank as much rest as possible and as much sleep as i can and not get run down
2785715 i kind of expected that with the preliminaries at night and the finals in the morning
2785716 subconsciously you are trying really hard because it is night
2785717 this is big i mean we couldnt sleep last night we were restless all day and anxious to get out here and do our thing
2785718 i dont know what kind of statement weve made but we played well
2785719 everyone is proud it felt great all the flags and people cheering it was a great game great atmosphere
2785720 how many times do you get to tell your kids and grandkids you played in the olympics
2785721 we went into the game knowing this tragedy had happened and also knew that four years had gone into this
2785722 we came into the tournament playing wonderful usa volleyball some of the greatest this decade this is about the team not individual people
2785723 as a team there is nothing more important to us than supporting mrs bachman in her struggle and supporting hugh and elisabeth in their grief
2785724 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2785725 hugh has been in touch with the team throughout this tragedy and were extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying they know were here for them in every way possible
2785726 the deputy foreign minister of china went to the hospital to express condolences and sympathy for the relatives of the victims
2785727 the chinese minister of health also went to the hospital to make sure everything possible could be done to help the injured
2785728 we are living in a world where surprises do happen
2785729 on the other hand well reassure you nothing like this will happen again
2785730 three or five criminals were killed and two policemen and one security person were injured i dont believe this will pose any threat to the olympics but of course we will strengthen security measures in this area
2785731 this continuation of their participation very much reflects the olympic spirit and the values of the games
2785732 the ioc believes this is absolutely the right decision most of all for the athletes who have trained so hard and for whom this a once in a lifetime possibly opportunity
2785733 theyve confirmed their participation very much in the light of respect friendship athlete to athlete so we have no reason to have any concerns on that today with regards to any other measures to be taken we dont at this time have any reason to believe thats necessary
2785734 its very difficult for us georgians because of everything thats going on at home
2785735 it was nice that natalia paderina came up to me after and gave me a handshake
2785736 participation in the olympic games athlete to athlete is under the spirit of respect and fair play
2785737 should it be confirmed that there was someone refusing on that basis this would be something the ioc would take seriously but this particular case that you raise hasnt been brought to our attention
2785738 it was our first time playing at this center court so it was pretty exciting
2785739 razvoj ide u pravcu u kome je i po eo davne 2001
2785740 when the increases from 2003 onward proved to be smaller than 6
2785741 one might say that the system became more highly leveraged rendering it more vulnerable to unanticipated downward deflection of the increase in federal research funds
2785742 can be addressed only at the level of policy and administrative practice by the congress and nih itself
2785743 it may be possible to create broad political support for large annual nih funding increases into the indefinite future
2785744 with the stroke of a pen the u s court of appeals has opened the door to a massive increase in the penetration of dvr capabilities
2785745 in short order effective dvr penetration could now jump to north of 60 of cable households that is all digital cable subscribers with an even larger increase in dvr outlets per home
2785746 when we plan well in advance we dont look at trends or the economy we plan for inflation what we have found in a lot of cities is that when we go to actually buy we can bring in the buys for less than we plan
2785747 its very rare for rates to go down but we are seeing in major east coast midwest and west coast markets instances where costs per gross ratings point are going down
2785748 we all know the economy is bad and its a natural thing to cut the rate to get more units
2785749 every day the media trade magazines forecast the media to be down next year we are driving it down ourselves the media rep agencies are all listening to the same preachers and they get crazy its a vicious cycle
2785750 memory seems to be made up mostly of still pictures
2785751 how do the networks reach the consumers when they are on the move
2785752 with the clout of an nbc or an abc clients are going to do that first
2785753 will not move the dial as the network revenue ad base is in the billions at most this could be 2 to 4 of their base business
2785754 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2785755 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
2785756 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2785757 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale
2785758 now they have this great platform they can cross fertilize with content and redistribute
2785759 the necessary flexibility to do something strategic with either of these businesses today
2785760 history has a way of changing things around in peoples minds
2785761 what people today dont remember or realize but i remember very clearly is how excited everybody was when this first happened your brethren in the press thought this was a very bold move aol was not the third fourth place or whatever it is today it was the leader
2785762 i smelled it a little bit but i didnt smell it enough to try to block it
2785763 if you own an suv and you know the long term prospects for an suv are not positive because the price of gas is going up what do you do
2785764 you figure out a way to make money put in a hybrid motor or electric motor or if youre a forward thinking company you sell it while it still has value but what you dont do is drive it in the mud and wait
2785765 the net net of this today is its a much less powerful much less dynamic much less elastic and growing organization
2785766 time warner management has acknowledged many times the negative impact of the aol deal after the internet bubble burst
2785767 we moved on after 2001 and undertook what was widely acknowledged as a difficult turnaround over a period of years
2785768 were continuing our transformation toward an even more content focused company with strong brands and improving prospects for growth
2785769 jeff has the view his core business is content and production
2785770 if were right time warner is getting close to an outright sale of aol
2785771 and if the division fetches the value we suspect of about 12 billion then we think theres about 2 50 of near term upside in time warner

2785783 the georgians were too quick to move they rolled the dice to regain control but that doesnt justify a russian act of aggression and invasion to take the georgian regime down
2785784 this is a watershed in relations with russia comparable to the 1979 afghan invasion since it is the first time they have sent troops illegally out of their borders
2785785 if russia continues a massive attack through next week its legitimacy as a neutral party will be harmed
2785786 an ongoing attack of thousands of tanks and troops will certainly make russia appear guilty in the eyes of the world
2785787 this is about the annihilation of democracy on russias borders
2785788 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want an immediate cease fire and international mediation

2785843 training with the french air force provided us the invaluable opportunity to learn from each others operational experience improve our combat skills and strengthen the bond of friendship between our great air forces and our great countries
2785844 the french visit provided an excellent opportunity to strengthen our social relationship and enhance future relations
2785845 there should be as many combined operations as possible before there are lessons learned in combat
2785846 the cooperation between france and the u s goes all the way back to world war i

2785850 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2785851 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2785852 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2785853 the day will come when these people will have to answer for their crimes to this country

2785855 un sentimiento de melancol a por el pasado sobrealimentado de vicisitudes
2785856 het publiek is een van de beste die ik elk jaar heb ze gaan uit de bol ze zingen mee ik heb daar veel respect voor
2785857 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2785858 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2785859 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2785863 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2785864 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2785948 bids are invited for the design layout typesetting and print production of the organizations 2000 annual report the designer is expected to present a design concept for the publication showing the overall design and the treatment for each of the elements when awarding the contract both the concept and the price are going to be taken into consideration
2785949 a lot of this pitching happens in australia and new zealand as well we frequently are involved in free pitches i consider them a necessary evil to doing business and cannot see alternatives given that our client market likes to play things that way
2785950 in the late 80s and early 90s this was just the way it worked you did the unpaid pitch or the work never seemed to come your way
2785951 these days when asked to make a speculative presentation many local agencies tell the prospective client that the presentation is not going to be free and many clients accept that these clients are professional enough to realize that the agency is spending valuable time money and effort so they agree to pay a rejection fee an amount mutually agreed upon beforehand
2785952 the graphic artists guild is unalterably opposed to any artist being asked to work on speculation because of the inherent risks to the artist in such circumstances art buyers should not ask artists to work on a project unless a fee has been agreed upon in advance artists must be adequately compensated at any time they are requested to create artwork working on speculation places all the risks on the artist without a commitment on the buyers part
2785953 a designer shall not undertake any work at the invitation of a client without payment of an appropriate fee
2785954 just like asking a construction company to build a house before one decides to actually buy it
2785955 there are other more appropriate methods of selecting a designer
2785956 the process of selecting a designer is largely trial and error and there are those who try to avoid the possibility of error by employing competition like methods of designer selection it is not something i do leaving the obvious ethical argument alone it just doesnt make sense from a business perspective having three different people or firms work on the same project at the same time is taxing on our own internal resources first wed have to educate them as to the nature of the business second wed have to give direction on the project itself and monitor its progress id much rather interview people see their work and make an educated guess as to who is better suited to a particular project while i may ask them to pitch a concept i wouldnt expect them to execute it prior to formally engaging their services
2785957 i do not do work on a speculative basis if someone wants to test drive me as a designer for future projects they pay for my time at my usual rates
2785958 lets say for the sake of argument that we have a budget of 100 000 we may take 5 000 and divide it between three people or firms thereby covering their initial expenses the firm that does the best work wins the project

2785966 only a few hours after the georgian president mikhael saakashvili officially announced that all fire would be seized in the name of the olympics and world peace georgian troops began a wide spread attack on all of south ossetia
2785967 the death toll in georgias breakaway republic has reached at least 2 000 according to russian and south ossetian sources georgian officials deny the figure is that high
2785968 the chief of russias ground forces says georgian shelling has destroyed all the hospitals in the south ossetian captial tskhinvali
2785969 its also reported that more than ten border villages have been burnt to the ground
2785970 the russian president dimitry medvedev said georgia is denying the whole of south ossetia the right to life by its actions
2785971 russian peacekeepers and military units are carrying out an operation to enforce georgia to a peace deal they are also responsible for defending of the civillian population
2785972 russias prime minister vladimir putin says the government is planning to allocate around us 400 million for the reconstruction of south ossetia
2785973 russias emergencys ministry has delivered the first consignment of medication to the south ossetian capital humanitarian aid and power generators are also expected to be delivered soon

2785984 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2785985 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2785986 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
2785987 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
2785988 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital
2785989 girl you better come on board this train because im going to be rich
2785990 not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly
2785991 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2785992 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2785993 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2785994 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2785995 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2785996 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2785997 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2785998 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
2785999 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man

2786044 figment of the tabloid press i dont want that garbage in with the puppy story
2786045 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to

2786054 barack obama has long been his partys presumptive nominee now hes becoming its presumptuous nominee
2786055 barack obama now says hes open to offshore oil drilling so apparently when he promised change he was talking about his mind
2786056 he did this speech and 100 000 people showed up there were so many germans shouting and screaming that france surrendered just in case
2786057 they really love barack obama in germany hes like a rock star over there impressive until you realize that david hasselhoff is also like a rock star over there
2786058 of course obamas supporters got him his usual birthday gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh
2786059 obamas people are trying to portray mccain as cranky and mccain is trying to portray obama as arrogant you see
2786060 see barack obama on the news hes becoming a workout fanatic hes at the gym like twice a day sometimes three times a day at the gym yeah according to his staff well he has to stay in shape to do those flip flops
2786061 barack obama back from his big european tour did you see him in europe people were cheering him holding up signs blowing him kisses and that was just the american media covering the story
2786062 murray waas how the presidents claims of executive privilege for the u s attorney probe could prove to be cataclysmic for his own party
2786063 roland heeft de sleutel zelf in handen kiest hij voor zijn ontwikkeling en speelminuten of laat hij het financi le verhaal zwaarder wegen het wordt tijd dat hij zich daarover uitspreekt
2786064 we see a rapid fall as we come toward the present day the rate of change is higher over the last 300 years than it has been for any time in the past 5 000 years its going from a strong field down to a weak field and its doing so very quickly
2786065 magnetic lines of force near the earths surface become twisted and tangled and magnetic poles pop up in unaccustomed places a south magnetic pole might emerge over africa for instance or a north pole over tahiti
2786066 i am very shocked i cannot see if we should live in this area any more
2786067 it is a tough area but convenient for the university i cannot believe this has happened
2786068 as chinese students we do not have any affairs with other people
2786069 we are far away from home and we live in a strange area i want to know why this happened
2786070 sometimes local children attack us i dont know whether it is because we come from another country
2786071 it is sooo amazing to me that i am living in your room
2786072 i live in echo park now im a magazine writer i have a cat with one eye
2786073 didnt you write an essay for the book the bitch in the house
2786074 that article paid for maybe two months of my car insurance it would have paid for three but i got a point
2786075 you wrote that article that was published in an actual book that is in stores in the room i sleep in in the bed i sleep in
2786076 you have really strong energy and i can feel it in there and its telling me what i want to be

2786078 i just i dont really believe in stuff like that
2786079 im just going to keep using your amazing energy and youll see
2786080 the organizers of orange county chose that name for the sordid purpose of real estate
2786081 they argued that eastern people would be attracted by the name and would rush to that county to buy orange ranches forgetful or perhaps ignorant of the fact that there were more than a hundred other places in the united states named orange
2786082 indeed the divine hand has been lavish in bestowing upon all southern california and upon orange county in particular rare natural advantages perhaps greater than those enjoyed by any other section over which the flag floats our climate is faultless in fact it is not too much to say that as to fertility of soil the charming climate and the scenery with its grandeur and beauty it is not surpassed the world around
2786083 he went off and voted with minority leader harry reid on the democratic substitute and i wrote him the now famous letter
2786084 i would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform legislation were sincere
2786085 im embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics i failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self interested partisan posturing appear more noble
2786086 that was one incident where he thought i had undercut him i had a completely different view of it
2786087 we had to take tough votes sometimes against the majority of our own party in order to preserve the coalition
2786088 when colleagues disagree on an issue the notion that its cause for attack is mistaken i felt very strongly that the guest worker program was not in the best interests of the country i voted against it he voted for it i respect senator mccains right to take positions different than mine what i dont do is abuse his integrity for doing so
2786089 we can disagree on issues without trying to tear down the other persons reputation or attack his character
2786090 this is a person who has engaged and energized millions of americans who had never been engaged in the political process
2786091 greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households
2786092 for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
2786093 independent studies show that ethanol production is keeping gasoline prices form going much higher than they already are by providing an important global source of incremental non opec fuel reducing the pressure on u s refinery capacity that has been severely strained in recent years and providing a low cost source of supply that is being blended with gasoline
2786094 it was the first score in our olympic campaign here at home and ill always remember it it represents that we can keep our heads up in the face of really tough odds
2786095 yao played a great game we were just trying to wear him down a little bit
2786096 he did a great job defensively at the beginning of the game eventually we wore down on him
2786097 for yao ming it was really a historical match so its really very significant for all of us
2786098 it would have been different without him not as special
2786099 darling belinda i know i only saw you last night and will see you again in a few days but there is something i wanted to put in writing i want to tell you how much i love and admire you
2786100 belinda that is a great dog he spent part of the winter with me
2786101 belinda i dont know what you were talking about goofy wolfed his supper as soon as i arrived and has dragged me round the entire neighbourhood
2786102 im afraid i was misled in my first diagnosis because goofy is trying to pretend hes all right in order to come home to you its bravado he is much sicker than i originally thought you asked if it was time i think now or in the next few days it is
2786103 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
2786104 hes almost identical to me hes a world record holder in all these events so he is dominating the events just like i did
2786105 there is nothing i am going to be able to say or do that is going to prevent this from happening it is what it is
2786106 on monday younes kaboul will be at the club for a medical
2786107 i spoke with kaka yesterday saturday we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet
2786108 i think an august transfer is still a possibility though kaka will only talk about that when they do a deal
2786109 he is waiting for a deal and then he will start to negotiate with chelsea
2786110 normally milan do not sell their best players we think they like the proposal but it is not so easy for them to accept it
2786111 its nice to see someone abiding by the law for a change
2786112 london is depressing cold cloudy and its always raining so i came here to get some sun
2786113 sometimes we feel were better supported here than back at home
2786114 we could have the fans behind us china has always been so supportive of us
2786115 in the states when you go into someone elses house they dont usually cheer for you
2786116 i dont think that happened it just goes to show you how globally the game is getting better its fun to see
2786117 were not looking to have an advantage but i think the fans here showed us a lot of respect
2786118 is it easier to get girls if you race in f1 the simple answer is yes but i dont have a girlfriend at the moment
2786119 i want to concentrate completely on my job because im at a phase of my career when a relationship particularly at the beginning would be too distracting
2786120 our staff have been hearing some truly heartbreaking stories children who got out but their parents didnt for example
2786121 i have seen war but what i saw today was terrible i havent seen anything like that in my life i was shocked what are we going to do now
2786122 un agencies and ngos will meet sunday to discuss the increasing humanitarian crisis and how the humanitarian actors can coordinate an effective response
2786123 i have sent the necessary papers to serik kadyrov today
2786124 i do not want to talk to someone who is in no way related to the organisation in question
2786125 i cannot talk to you over the phone about these issues
2786126 i do not want to talk to you about this talk to khodjaeva she has received a copy of the decision
2786127 kim has made an appeal and the case is continuing
2786128 i was a bishop in the congo where i was born but i was following the terrible events because i was a part of what was called the francophone province which was comprised of three countries rwanda burundi and congo we had several meetings and i knew what was going on in rwanda it was terrible to me it was a spiritual challenge
2786129 when the war broke out the church in rwanda was at its infancy level so they were busy baptizing but discipleship was a challenge which we are now doing
2786130 much of the killings took place within families uncles killed a nephew nephew killed an uncle the aunties and even parents killed their own children and even children killed their parents
2786131 of course there was much killing between the two groups but there was also many mixed marriages and mixed blood for a number of years
2786132 to me we all blame each other but we forget that it was the devil behind it so unless the devil is blamed and is challenged genocide can take place in another form anywhere
2786133 there were nine million and over one million died within a 100 days
2786134 it was terrible it was inhuman we still weep over what happened
2786135 i think the lord called him to be a support of the church in rwanda
2786136 we praying and weeping that there would be another revival or second reformation not just in rwanda but all over the world we have gone through the forty days of purpose there have been so many confessions of faith in christ and so many reconciliations as a result of this
2786137 i have just been at a big gathering where thousands of people came to the lord so rwanda is now coming under the fire of the spirit there have been many miracles that we have witnessed
2786138 human beings are always weak but it is my hope that we will never witness another genocide in the country our slogan is never again not only in rwanda but all over the world its my hope but the church has to take the lead genocide is a sign of the spiritual decline of a nation
2786139 during my time as chairman i tried very hard to involve the church and actually the numbers of infection are decreasing so the spread is almost at a stable stage so we are caring more and more but of course the smell of death is still with us we cant imagine having more people die because of hiv so we hope well manage to stop it and then care for our already infected
2786140 pray for spiritual awakening pray in rwanda and for strong spiritual families but also pray for the economy because always there is that temptation especially for young women when they are poor that they will be forced to use what is available to them
2786141 so when the economy is improved then there are less temptations for young women
2786142 it is going to be a long day so i just have to stay patient
2786143 the future is bright and the confusion is over we will give complete support to the inrc the mai would do its best and this is not a promise but an assurance
2786144 since they have not succeeded in breaking my spirit the masks fell and we came to this arbitrary and illegal decision that tramples on any notion of justice and equity
2786145 it is these totalitarian practices and decisions that bring the sporting spirit and the olympic ideal that my country gave birth to into disrepute
2786146 the way the whole thing was manipulated there is no time we would have to seek an injunction against the events taking place and katerina certainly did not want that
2786147 in the past month i ve been in so much pain and i haven t been able to practice for 10 days
2786148 i haven t even hit a ball since arriving in beijing
2786149 actually i didn t adopt any specific measures i think just the training was important
2786150 an elegant sufficiency content retirement rural quiet friendship books ease and alternate labour useful life
2786151 teams such as germany the netherlands and spain are all quality teams who along with a number of other countries are all capable of winning gold at beijing
2786152 no one wanted to see india out of the olympics but the reality is that the best 12 nations have qualified for beijing
2786153 but i am confident they will come back stronger and ready to take on the world again
2786154 com s que aix no saplica per trobar el remei a la malaltia
2786155 i am very confident that they are going to play hard and they are going to play well im excited about getting out there and watching them play we have a lot to do but we have a good plan for it
2786156 we need to get them through camp and matriculation and get them into the season where they can play a role and find a niche
2786157 we need to create depth and thats where its going to come from
2786158 not changing the offense gave these guys a third spring in this offense and now they should be feeling pretty confident about their responsibilities
2786159 we moved ben brandt from defensive tackle to offensive tackle at the end of spring practice and he really helped us offensively im just so appreciative of ben to make that switch it was a unselfish move on his part to come over and help us there id like to make sure we get this quarterback thing tied together losing kyle hughes quarterback thumb injury in the spring was a concern a little bit and i hope his hand is going to be alright where he can be effective so we just get a little more execution from our offensive team but they should know what to do
2786160 defensively i think our players are focused in what to do
2786161 i hope we can be really sound in the kicking game

2786164 she said her period just went off and feel like she in heat
2786165 athens was a great souvenir sydney was my first olympics eight years ago i had a very good tournament finishing fourth and just missing out on a medal
2786166 one of my dreams is to do well at the olympics
2786167 representing my country is very important to me last time i got the honour of carrying the flag its one of those moments you dream about to walk into the stadium with the flag and the fans on one side and the athletes on the other
2786168 eight years ago i met my girlfriend at the olympics so that was a highlight but carrying the flag was also a highlight maybe meeting my girlfriend was more of highlight because weve been together eight years but the flag only lasts 10 minutes
2786169 this will probably be my most unique birthday of all time unless we have a baby on a birthday but thats not planned
2786170 perhaps if he had taken a look around once in a while at all the good people who were helping him up he might have realized that he didnt get where he was all alone
2786171 a resident in the south blount utility district said they got a notice of violation of safe drinking water standards indicating their drinking water was contaminated with high levels of lead
2786172 it was a touching moment and a lovely display of republican family values
2786173 the very sad thing is there are people that one wouldn t readily categorize as being racist in any other situation that do feel that obama being president would
2786174 one thing about davis he has consistently blamed democrats for all the national and regional ills and now he blames them for not being re elected
2786175 taking a stand against china s big redemptive pr show by declining to attend would ve been consistent and coherent
2786176 lets set aside the question of whether our expectations have sunk so low that we actually give kudos to politicians for just doing the right thing
2786177 katie allison granju signed off for the last time at knoxville talks yesterday

2786182 how amazing it was to watch as you turned within 48 hours from an attacking congressional candidate to a national pariah
2786183 and speaking of honesty she and her friends standing in the dark in the house chamber might want to stop claiming that off shore drilling will give us immediate relief from high gas prices
2786184 once again the gop leadership sided with oil profiteers and used their power to help keep oil prices and profits high while hurting the average american
2786185 if passion alone won elections it would be a landslide for tuke this fall should he get the nomination

2786188 thank heavens the white kids in nashvilles public schools are doing so well academically
2786189 the piece discusses the increased interest in bicycling that has accompanied higher gasoline prices
2786190 i have trouble understanding the separation between the roane alliance a county government function supported by our tax dollars and the chamber of commerce
2786191 todays message is simple all the gobs have to do is wait long enough and the voters of this county will forget whatever transgressions may have angered them in the past
2786192 to shield itself from public accountability the white house crafted rules which ignored centuries of legal precedent and tossed aside even the barest semblance of justice in favor of a system automatically tilted toward the prosecution
2786193 also please ask whomever is your choice for president why he bought 5 6 million dollars in advertising during the olympics knowing what china is doing in darfur tibet berma and other human and animal rights violations
2786194 of course the malkin tents are going to claim another victory but hey look at it this way we liberals can snicker at them for defending a holiday with communist socialist origins founded by the evil labor unions
2786195 forty five percent of volunteering in tennessean is performed in the religious sector whereas that number is 63 in utah

2786199 regardless of intent the regulation certainly could functionally allow the defining of contraceptives as abortion
2786200 ive come across several blog entries recently that recount stories of women being lied to by their healthcare providers and or being lectured on the basis of their providers personal values
2786201 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2786202 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2786203 were at the point where were saying thank god 80 per cent of them are using an illegal drug rather than alcohol even though in 10 years theyll be suffering manic depressive disorders
2786204 but we just couldnt deal with that many people affected by alcohol
2786205 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2786206 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2786207 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2786208 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2786209 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2786210 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2786211 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2786212 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2786213 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2786214 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2786215 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2786216 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2786217 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2786218 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2786219 who are open to doing something on the production side
2786220 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2786221 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2786222 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2786223 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2786224 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2786225 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2786226 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2786227 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2786228 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2786229 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2786230 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2786231 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2786232 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2786233 it is a tragic loss for the mountaire family because it is a close knit company our thoughts and prayers are with the family
2786234 we will be assisting the authorities as we wait for more information
2786235 obviously we want to have as many lanes open as possible
2786236 we are certainly not going to open the roadway until its safe
2786237 its a slow moving process people are getting through but its going to be a while
2786238 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2786239 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2786240 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2786241 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2786242 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2786243 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

2786246 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2786247 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2786248 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2786249 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

2786251 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2786252 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2786253 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2786254 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2786255 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2786256 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2786257 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2786258 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2786259 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2786260 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

2786262 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2786263 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2786264 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2786265 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2786266 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

2786268 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2786269 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2786270 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2786271 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2786272 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2786273 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2786274 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2786275 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2786276 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2786277 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2786278 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2786279 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2786280 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2786281 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2786282 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2786283 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2786284 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2786285 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2786286 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2786287 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2786288 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2786289 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2786290 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2786291 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2786292 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2786293 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2786294 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2786295 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2786296 does this means that its just a state of my mind where i tend to seek something near perfect today all i know that there would be someone who would be thinking like me or would be on the same journey which i am on well i have to wait and find out sadness
2786297 we would have to achieve a truce and we would have to deal with the same parties as before
2786298 stay there two years and destroy the hamas regime down to the last office and the last activist
2786299 you israel control another people against their will and the palestinian people when they compare the two will choose hamas and not those who talk
2786300 those who miss the operations in the gaza strip dont worry they will come
2786301 its a bit cheeky for the police to say that we had to be rescued when for starters we werent in any danger and secondly they were the ones who had confiscated our safety boat this morning
2786302 the river police were very professional and courteous unlike their land lubbing equivalents
2786303 it shows how serious we are about stopping climate change that people from all walks of life were prepared despite blatantly intimidatory policing to take direct action to disrupt e on this olympic effort certainly deserves a gold medal
2786304 its been a great today but a real victory for us will be when we have conclusively scuppered e ons coal fuelled mania if hutton gives the green light to this power plant e on can expect to be seeing a lot more of us in the future
2786305 malcolm wicks claim that building an unabated coal fired power station at kingsnorth is necessary to save us from climate change shows him to be delusional and dangerously scientifically illiterate

2786316 the thrill of it all a visual history 1972 1982
2786317 the first thing they did was to put in huge palm trees that take so much water just to announce their arrival
2786318 its gorgeous here we dont have any natural disasters no forest fires no hurricanes tornadoes or floods good schools lots of cheap land the cost of livings down we have proximity to the colorado river to flagstaff to las vegas to phoenix
2786319 theres going to be quite a few more people looking to kingman once the dam bypass goes through
2786320 we cant say were in a bad cycle right now so we should just stop what were doing
2786321 we cant do that you have to just recognize that were going to go through down cycles and up cycles
2786322 theres going to be another million people here in the next 10 years
2786323 i was attracted to this area for the peace and solitude but peace and solitude no longer exists with 80 000 people living a mile from me
2786324 they said they were going to use desert plants and all this but the first thing they did was to put in huge palm trees that take so much water just to announce their arrival
2786325 were not yet condo on condo neighbor on neighbor with five foot easements i mean its going to come but its not here today
2786326 theres going to be growth here no matter what its just how we handle it
2786327 all that soil out there are plants that grew 6 000 years ago and didnt decompose completely
2786328 thats what peat is so were just making the same thing happen that happened here for millennia
2786329 we were capturing a lot of c02 at levels much greater than other systems marshes and forests grasslands
2786330 they can just sit back and watch the tules grow and they should be making money
2786331 thats what the vision is its not to do it just on twitchell island its to see if we can do it throughout the delta on subsided land
2786332 when oxygen is limited the bugs the microbes have to eat and breathe somehow
2786333 they will use sulfate iron or some other compound instead of producing c02 at the end of the pathway they end up producing methane
2786334 you probably wont be able to replicate it everywhere because we have a long growing season and we have very specific conditions that occur in the delta that dont occur worldwide

2786354 my first pseudonym in the business was edward marks out of respect for his work
2786355 theres always been this unspoken connection between celebrity money and fetishism in the uk
2786356 i learned early on the difference between a true fetish style and something that is phony and misunderstood
2786357 i was probably the first european adult producer to switch to video
2786358 certainly in the uk i was the first i was worried about the look for a long time and i got even more worried when i saw how some adult producers started abusing the image just pointing and shooting it looked so bad a lot of really poor fetish content got made and it damaged the market
2786359 the first time i went into a dutch adult store i knew holland was going to be good to me
2786360 that store was as big as a supermarket it took me an hour to check out all the titles in the fetish section alone
2786361 there were some stuff that went out under my banner in germany that was too strong even for me nobody got hurt but it was turning into something beyond fetish something dark
2786362 i was happy just to write and have legends like fred lincoln direct
2786363 to them it was something they had no interest in
2786364 in fact some of it is brilliant and innovative but its a tiny percentage of all the material that is labeled and marketed as fetish
2786365 i carry all this knowledge of fetish around in my head over thirty five years worth of images and moods and situations that i need to communicate to the artists i work with and through them to the fetish audience im not seeing real fetish in the majority of content out there and thats got to change
2786366 what we are seeing in young adults right now could foretell a much larger number of melanoma cases in older women
2786367 chopra and his fellow travelers are doing nothing essentially different from the tactics of scientific creationists and intelligent design advocates who seek to translate religious dogma derived from scripture into cosmetic seemingly
2786368 every religion diagnoses a problem to which it then prescribes a single solution one often feels the problem has been derived from the solution so as to provide a felt need for it in the manner of madison avenue

2786383 it is in progress and hopefully before the year ends we will launch it for now we own 100 percent of the venture
2786384 can you imagine how much revenues we will lose and how much of the expenditures for government measures to mitigate the impact of high prices on the poor will be cut because it tax rate does not rise with inflation it should move with inflation
2786385 if ever we shift to specific tax it should be revenue neutral that is the minimum requirement
2786386 it rises with the increasing prices and goes down with decreasing prices it has that natural feature that restrains demand when prices go up
2786387 it is in progress and hopefully before the year ends we will launch it for now we own 100 percent of the venture
2786388 we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side
2786389 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia

2786410 im not dangling from the top of his head its his shoulders shoulders

2786414 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2786415 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2786416 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2786417 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2786418 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2786419 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2786420 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2786421 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2786422 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2786423 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2786424 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2786425 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2786426 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2786427 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2786428 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2786429 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2786430 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2786431 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2786432 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2786433 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2786434 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2786435 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2786436 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2786437 i thought standardbreds were artificially gaited and wore tons of unnecessary ugly clunky equipment
2786438 but the moment the very moment that i worked with them i knew they were extraordinarily special horses
2786439 they were so calm with real grit and guts they werent nutty fools like thoroughbreds were i really really became enamored of them as a breed and that was that
2786440 it is a challenge to balance home and work but i have said i have the best support team in the world
2786441 number one my husband tom fanning does a lot at home with the kids
2786442 ive had ann davis the same babysitter since the children were born thats just invaluable to have a third person that can pick up or be there if tom or i are late she is more like a member of the family without her i dont know what i would do
2786443 our schedules are so wacky and so often involve nights and odd hours thats shes really important
2786444 i really had not had a high regard for standardbreds
2786445 i showed horses i loved thoroughbreds and hot walked at a mix breed farm near us
2786446 that was the year that starlark hanover turned three and david wade was his foos trainer and they had a falling out
2786447 david wade left and took all the grooms with him they pressed me into service to help out with the harness horses until they could get more grooms that was in 1974
2786448 i bet on a horse called golden phoenix driven by herve filion
2786449 it won and i think i won 12 which sounds like nothing but at the time in 1974 it was a weeks pay
2786450 it was going to be something i did for a year before i went to college but then circumstances changed and then it became important that i worked
2786451 he had been walking hots for thoroughbred trainer danny perlsweig when the meadowlands harness meet opened he went to the stable gate to look for a job and ray needed help
2786452 that was when niatross was a two year old in 1979
2786453 tom loved the track and he wanted to see if he could work with animals
2786454 finally marvin bachrad offered me a job at brandywine and i think it was for 30 a day
2786455 because my brother tim lived in phoenixville i could live with him and drive to brandywine in delaware every day which i loved
2786456 i helped out in the public relations department and if people wanted to take a day off i would do their job whatever it was i was willing to do anything at the track i was thrilled to be there
2786457 marvin used to say to me you know you can go home but i wanted to be there for everything for qualifiers to the watch the horses brandywine was a beautiful track i wanted to learn everything
2786458 the only opening they had was running the matrix board which i no idea how to do but i was willing to go to the training course to do
2786459 then pr director bill fidati found a spot for me in publicity
2786460 i love the racetrack and the racetrack community and culture
2786461 so it was like a home for me i particularly loved garden state park and general manager bob quigley and eileen quigley who not only made it an esthetically pleasing place but a great place to work quigley assembled a lot of talent there and i learned a lot
2786462 a full time opening came open in accounting and i took it
2786463 i continued to work in the pr office as well they had the breeders crown at garden state in 1986 and that is when i met tom charters
2786464 for someone like me the breeders crown coming to garden state was like sitting on the bench at the super bowl or having back stage access to a springsteen concert
2786465 he said hed send us the jackets and said by any chance did i want a job as well his assistant had just left i mulled it over tom fanning once again the voice of reason in all things said youd be a complete idiot not to take it thats a big step up and it will open doors
2786466 so i started there in 1987 88 as an assistant to tom charters
2786467 ive been very privileged to have had three of the very best bosses in marvin bachrad bill fidati and tom charters who were just patient and gave everybody an opportunity and tried to help in every way without those three im not sure id have the career i have those three have mentored more people and sent more people down their career paths
2786468 tom recognized i was eager and willing and there pretty much wasnt anything i wouldnt do
2786469 wherever there was a gap i tried to do it most of the time it was just the two of us and we didnt do it with a lot of budget
2786470 we didnt get married until no sex please was in the elitlopp
2786471 that was what i did the week before my wedding i went to the elitlopp in 1991 i wanted to be married and have a child but i wanted both of our futures to be a little more stable before we married i wanted to settle to settle down and not have to raise kids in a tack room
2786472 everybody in our office mary lou callie juliana we have kept the people who feel the same as tom charters and i do
2786473 we try to pride ourselves on our customer service for all the races we service and take eligibilities for we really try to make a big deal out of the hambletonian and the breeders crowns and some others that the society owns
2786474 you see them the staff in their good clothes on hambletonian day pushing boxes
2786475 im sure we log 30 000 steps that day theres nothing that they dont consider their job we try very hard to make the experience as pleasant and exciting as we can
2786476 i had a fellow tell me that when i get my packet in july about the hambletonian thats when i get really excited even if my horse is an outside shot
2786477 he said when i get the pin and all the information about the week it makes it all worth it that ive paid the money and put up with all the bad training reports if i get a chance to be there that packet gets me thinking about it and dreaming about it
2786478 from the beginning the breeders crown has been enormously important in divisional honors
2786479 it carries enormous weight with year end voters thats also why we try to make the experience different from every other race theyre in twenty five years later it is pretty well entrenched as a franchise
2786480 if there is a race that has recognition globally it is the hambletonian
2786481 i have to commend the formation of the hambletonian society in 1926 to promote and further the trotting breed the hambletonian has been the constant
2786482 the society also sees there are important things to address in harness racing and even though it is not their mission they have in the case of the rmtc racing medication and testing consortium and the special meeting on bringing fans back to harness racing on thursday of hambletonian week which was a first
2786483 they were very pleased with that and want to move a couple of things forward from that when they isolate what they do feel they can have an impact on thats something that has been developing the last couple of years
2786484 thats mostly because the racetrack has always been the venue that felt like home to me
2786485 but i get the best of the best the best days the best horses the best drivers
2786486 my job has to be one of the top five jobs in harness racing because of its flexibility support from people who work here and with whom we work at the tracks

2786499 with each new detail the john edwards rielle hunter saga continues to raise more questions than it answers
2786500 too often we hear that the dramatic security improvement in iraq is due not to the surge but to other unrelated factors and that the positive developments of the past 18 months have been merely a coincidence
2786501 the opposite of love is not hate its indifference the opposite of art is not ugliness its indifference the opposite of faith is not heresy its indifference and the opposite of life is not death its indifference
2786502 a question of facts 9 11 attacks reality or myth
2786503 whats a few minutes i just hope that poor person is ok
2786504 let he that is without sin cast the first stone
2786505 there is therefore now no condemnation to him who walks in christ jesus
2786506 do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind
2786507 do not think of yourself more highly than you ought to think but think soberly as god has dealt to each a measure of faith
2786508 trust in the lord with all your heart lean not to your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him and he shall direct your paths
2786509 far too many tooths have been needlessly flushed down the toilet we can make this gooder for children across the nation
2786510 run the city them and jews its the truth no its the truth they do theyre the ones with all the money
2786511 obviously the most successful people i dont know in the sense what i said but if you ask anybody who is successful its because they are savvy they know what direction to go in they dont have obstacles to face like everybody else does theyre so caught up in their goals they dont let anything else get in their path that why they are so successful obviously thats what i meant i work for them i see them i talk to them about it my manager is jewish he is successful
2786512 we ran into a slight problem while transcribing his comments most of them were unintelligible and made absolutely no sense
2786513 i had a perfect game plan and it worked perfectly i wasnt the one that was supposed to go out of the game again it was something that was out of my hands and thats why i got voted out not because of my actions inside the house with the people that are inside the house
2786514 i dont think the friends and family of everybody else would call in just to help me out if that makes sense to you it makes perfectly logical sense to me
2786515 ive never been so confused in my life as those ten minutes with him
2786516 you even said that libra was the most deviant person in the house whats the freakiest thing youve ever seen her do
2786517 came out of the shower with steven when he was still in the house i dont know if they caught that on tape im sure they did but im sure they didnt air it because of how grotesque it was point being im not even going to bring that up steven knows what happened steven deep down knows what really happened whether or not libra wants to face the music or not different story
2786518 my wife and i found the tape when antique hunting and borrowed equipment to watch it
2786519 we decided we wanted to make it into a piece of outdoor art simmy and i enjoyed our time in liverpool with bollywood steps so much and had made a number of friends so we approached the culture company with the idea
2786520 they were very keen and commissioned us to go ahead it seemed only right that a film made and based in liverpool should come home in the capital of culture year
2786521 i would never let my baby starve i would have got food for my baby whether i begged borrowed or stole it i just needed to talk to someone intelligent
2786522 then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father take your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world
2786523 then the righteous will answer him lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink when did we see you a stranger and invite you in or needing clothes and clothe you when did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you
2786524 the king will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
2786525 then he will say to those on his left depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
2786526 they also will answer lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and did not help you
2786527 he will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me

2786664 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2786665 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2786666 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2786667 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2786668 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2786669 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2786670 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2786671 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2786686 my girlfriends and i watched princess dianas funeral at the house as adults our kids claimed that they were too old to sleep on blow up mattresses around the ping pong table and demanded rooms of their own we had family extended family even ex spouses stay there with us that dining room table was the center of so much fun in the house the kids played uno and there was always a great meal served there every evening the house was tongue and groove and bead board and fresh paint and crisp floral sheets and always a load of laundry in the dryer and hundreds of photos of the marshalls their kids and friends i dont think well ever find anything like it again

2786731 hes a real modest guy kind of a quiet guy
2786732 it might even benefit him because he feels like the guy in the shadow the guy that has something to prove he doesnt like to brag about himself at all

2786739 i cant wear cheap jewelry because i get a rash
2786740 nickel release from earrings purchased in the united states the san francisco earring study
2786741 sensitization to nickel is quite common in the united states with studies estimating that 5 8 percent of american adults tested positive to nickel allergy through a routine skin test
2786742 in the early 1990s the european union nickel directive was passed in an effort to decrease the prevalence of nickel sensitization in consumer and occupational products in europe with results indicating the directive is working however no such regulations exist in the united states to limit nickel exposure leaving millions of people at risk for dermatitis from common goods such as earrings
2786743 except for one store targeting girls and young women where a significant number of dmg positive earrings were found the proportion of earrings that tested positive for nickel was generally higher among individual china town stores and local artists than in individual national and international chain stores
2786744 we also found no correlation between the country where the earrings were manufactured and the frequency of dmg positive reactions or whether the price of the inexpensive earrings correlated with testing positive for nickel exposure
2786745 from our findings we could not establish a safe limit price as a guide for consumers who want to avoid excessive nickel exposure when purchasing inexpensive earrings
2786746 but its safe to say that young customers purchasing earrings at a considerable price range in u s chain stores are potentially at risk of nickel exposure and sensitization
2786747 we are amidst a world financial crisis that is why the creation of a new financial economic system is necessary
2786748 we are determined to industrialize venezuela and i know that you are ready to re energize the industrialization of argentina

2786754 the rising incidence of nickel allergy in the united states and elsewhere high nickel sensitization rates documented in children and a resurgent issue of biomedical device complication specifically nickel allergy due to metal to dismiss nickels importance and relevance to public health and skin disease would be a mistake
2786755 today the supreme court affirmed what almost everyone but the administration and their defenders in congress always knew the constitution and the rule of law bind all of us even in extraordinary times of war no one is above the constitution the historic writ of habeas corpus endures this is a major rebuke of the administrations post 9 11 policies that have divided us at home alienated and isolated us abroad and made americans less safe the next step is to erase this great stain on our moral authority by promptly shutting down guantanamo

2786757 as sen kerry and two friends left dinner at the straight wharf restaurant on nantucket and walked down the dock a large group on a boat recognized sen kerry and asked if they could have a photo taken the group came off the boat and onto the dock took a photo with sen kerry and his friends and then sen kerry and his two friends immediately walked away end of story
2786758 there wasnt anything inappropriate about it at all he didnt make any lewd comments he was just being nice taking some pictures with his fans it lasted maybe five minutes then he went on his way and we went back to the boat
2786759 online hes being made out to be this horrible person who parties with underage girls and he didnt do it
2786760 im definitely going to think about what we put online from now on
2786761 we enjoy having sen kerry as a guest hes always a gentleman
2786762 if the question is are there people who drink too much and have parties on boats in the boat basin then the answer is yes senator kerry walked past they asked him to take a picture he did and moved on anything more than that is just silly

2786788 what was true of an ancient community of christian believers struggling with a powerful and appealing philosophy is also true for christians in a postmodern context arguments that deconstruct the regimes of truth at work in the late modern culture of global capitalism are indispensable so also is a deeper understanding of the counterideological force of the biblical tradition but such arguments are no guarantee that the biblical metanarrative will not be co opted for ideological purposes of violent exclusion nor do arguments prove the truth of the gospel only the nonideological embracing forgiving and shalom filled life of a dynamic christian community formed by the story of jesus will prove the gospel to be true and render the idolatrous alternatives fundamentally implausible

2786806 the solution to the problem rests solely with the mauritanians we are going to help them to reach an agreement
2786807 we want to prevent mauritania from falling into a vicious cycle where the crisis deepens and the international community is led to take measures that would be unfortunate for the lives and the future of the mauritanian people

2786839 explain to the mothers and fathers of american servicemen that may come home in body bags why their son or daughter have to give up their life
2786840 the president is once again releasing american military might on a foreign country with an ill defined objective and no exit strategy he has yet to tell the congress how much this operation will cost and he has not informed our nations armed forces about how long they will be away from home these strikes do not make for a sound foreign policy
2786841 if we are going to commit american troops we must be certain they have a clear mission an achievable goal and an exit strategy
2786842 i had doubts about the bombing campaign from the beginning i didnt think we had done enough in the diplomatic area
2786843 i cannot support a failed foreign policy history teaches us that it is often easier to make war than peace this administration is just learning that lesson right now the president began this mission with very vague objectives and lots of unanswered questions a month later these questions are still unanswered there are no clarified rules of engagement there is no timetable there is no legitimate definition of victory there is no contingency plan for mission creep there is no clear funding program there is no agenda to bolster our over extended military there is no explanation defining what vital national interests are at stake there was no strategic plan for war when the president started this thing and there still is no plan today
2786844 no goal no objective not until we have those things and a compelling case is made then i say back out of it because innocent people are going to die for nothing thats why im against it

2786858 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2786859 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2786860 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2786861 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2786862 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2786863 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2786864 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2786865 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2786866 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2786867 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2786868 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2786869 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2786870 mommy do you want to play power rangers with me
2786871 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2786872 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2786873 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2786874 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2786875 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2786876 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2786877 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2786878 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2786879 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2786880 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here
2786881 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2786882 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2786883 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2786884 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2786885 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2786886 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2786887 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2786888 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2786889 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2786890 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2786891 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2786892 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2786893 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2786894 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2786895 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2786896 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2786897 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2786898 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2786899 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2786900 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2786901 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2786902 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2786903 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2786904 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2786905 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

2786907 but he chose me and i agreed to marry him right away
2786908 at least 20 percent of the families on the island have been lifted out of poverty
2786909 we were angry at each other in a quiet way
2786910 a marriage that is not based on love often brings problems
2786911 how can you live happily ever after when you met your husband three weeks before the wedding
2786912 any country will do ill take anyone who will accept me
2786913 we had to work no matter how hot it was no matter how much it rained from 5 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon sometimes we could only afford rice porridge
2786914 its my destiny to be poor if i had another daughter id ask her to marry a foreigner
2786915 taiwanese women want to get married when they are much older and they are also very opinionated
2786916 no one ever came on our trip without finding their dream bride
2786917 they take hundreds of women at a time to a hotel and line them up for the men
2786918 there wont be anyone left for us marriage shouldnt be about money it should be about love
2786919 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
2786920 every soldier and officer should absolutely disobey any order to kill muslims or aid their killers
2786921 narrative games are barely past the infant stage and critical commentary and analysis about them are even less developed
2786922 everyone is still trying to figure out who everyone else is and in this process communities form themselves we are on the ground floor of this effort to try to figure out how to talk intelligently about video games how to analyze them and develop a critical language to discuss them were not like other disciplines im not even sure i would call us a discipline yet because were all figuring this out together we dont even have the terms yet
2786923 part of our trepidation about what to call it is that there is already a field called game studies and some of us arent comfortable with where thats going or dont feel we quite fit in there
2786924 braid is finally out on xbla today and what with it being beautiful intelligent and 400 ms points more expensive than gamers might be used to im a little worried not as many people will be playing the game as it deserves
2786925 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2786926 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2786927 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2786928 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2786929 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2786930 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2786931 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2786932 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2786933 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2786934 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2786935 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2786936 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2786937 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2786938 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2786939 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2786940 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2786941 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2786942 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2786943 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2786944 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2786945 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2786946 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2786947 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2786948 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2786949 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2786950 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2786951 however their attempts have so far been foiled and other such cases will be uncovered and dealt with

2786956 she just really wanted to get into the water she always just loved it
2786957 when stephanie won the gold medal at the commonwealth games her mum said have you opened that bottle of french champagne yet and i said no no no shes got the olympics to go yet
2786958 i really hated the 400im but bohley kept saying this is the event you could win at the olympics
2786959 she was really determined at that age that was what she wanted to do so the family my husband allan hickey myself and stephanies father warren we had to re look at everything because of the financial coast and we had to make some decisions to try to minimise some of the money
2786960 she was at a private school with hideous school fees every year and then you had the swimming costs plus travel costs associated with getting them to these competitions we told her we had to consider a different school and that it was really up to her
2786961 lets just put it this way shes the girl with the million dollar smile
2786962 you only have to look at the likes of duncan armstrong who won gold in the mens 200m freestyle 20 years ago and hes still on the tv commentating
2786963 then theres raelene boyle doing the commentary on track and field for channel seven so shes still earning money 40 years after her first olympic medal she won silver in mexico in 68
2786964 the fact thats shes now won an olympic medal and she didnt just win it either she smashed the world record shell have that for the rest of her life
2786965 from a profile point of view it has established her now shell always be an olympic gold medallist and its only just the start of the games so well just have to see how the rest of it goes
2786966 obviously thats going to be very very lucrative for her long term
2786967 everyone was out of their chairs cheering her on or at least the ones who could stand up
2786968 she is a lovely girl and this hasnt gone to her head shes won numerous medals but this is a really good one shell be happy about this
2786969 i felt confident she would win shes a great fighter and shes in wonderful condition kathryn hoff took this record off her but now shes got it back its great
2786970 i shouldve taken up bowls a bit earlier and i might have been a bit better

2787010 what was this lilly white jersey girl gonna say to us
2787011 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document amp 183 as outlined in mr suskinds book
2787012 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2787013 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2787014 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2787015 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2787016 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2787017 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2787018 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2787019 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2787020 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2787021 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
2787022 i want you to be fine young people who cherish the ideal of benefiting the nation while at the same time making efforts in your immediate environment to solidify your own foundations
2787023 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2787024 piercing the reeds my darting eyes transfix plunged in the cooling waves immortal necks and cries of fury echo through the air splendid cascades of tresses disappear in shimmering jewels pursuing them i find there at my feet two sleepers intertwined bruised in the languor of duality their arms about each other heedlessly i bear them still entangled to a height where frivolous shadow never mocks the light and dying roses yield the sun their scent that with the day our passions might be spent
2787025 gay with the conquest of those traitorous fears i sinned when i divided the dishevelled tuft of kisses that the gods had ravelled for hardly had i hidden an ardent moan deep in the joyous recesses of one holding by a finger that her swanlike pallor from her sisters passion might be tinged with colour the little one unblushingly demure when from my arms loosened by death obscure this prey ungrateful to the end breaks free spurning the sobs that still transported me
2787026 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe

2787037 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2787038 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others

2787066 overborgmesteren og et flertal af partier i borgerrepr sentationen optog f rst forhandlinger med de unge efter at en forhandlingsgruppe viste vilje til at tage afstand fra vold og h rv rk og i stedet gjorde brug af konstruktiv dialog for mange af beboerne i nordvest var det ikke en god nyhed at ungdomshuset skulle v re en del af deres kulturhus p dortheavej det er derfor ikke uforst eligt at beboerne er bekymrede men i f llesskab er der tro og h b om at det er muligt at g re omr det omkring dortheavej endnu bedre og dermed give nordvest et kulturelt l ft
2787067 flere af borgerne i b de nordvest og andre steder har kritiseret at aftalen om ungdomshuset har v ret udemokratisk de forskellige politikere i borgerrepr sentationen har i lang tid modtaget og svaret p hundredvis af breve og mails med synspunkter p en ny placering bispebjerg lokaludvalg har afholdt en r kke borgerm der om et ungdomshus i nordvest da der var tale om en placering p frederikssundsvejens skole de politikere der sidder i borgerrepr sentationen er blevet valgt for at indg aftaler og tr ffe beslutninger og selvf lgelig bliver h ringsprocessen som nu er i gang i regi af lokaludvalget taget alvorligt selv om selve placeringen ikke kan ndres i sidste ende st r politikerne naturligvis til ansvar for deres beslutninger ved det n ste kommunalvalg

2787224 the russian government will not accede to the terrorists demands nor will it be swayed by hostage pleas for mercy
2787225 without the parents and children as hostages the terrorists would be powerless anyone who assists terrorist monsters in any capacity is an enemy to the russian people and will be treated as such
2787226 the moscow theater crisis was a perfect example of my willingness to do everything necessary to battle terrorists
2787227 as prime minister my first job is to keep the russian people safe terrorists want to destroy russia but we will not let them make no mistake terrorists and those who happen to be near them will meet with a swift terrible end
2787228 to ensure the stability of our country we need to take a firm stance against terrorists

2787230 if achnais oven is in fact kosher as i say it is then let this carob tree prove it
2787231 if the oven is kosher then let the stream of water prove it
2787232 no proof can be brought from a stream of water
2787233 if the oven is kosher as i say it is let the walls of this house of study prove it

2787243 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2787244 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2787245 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2787246 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2787247 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2787248 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2787249 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2787250 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2787292 is there a connection between rock music and voodoo or african paganism
2787293 the incessant poly rhythms pounded out on cylindrical drums by african tribals is the catalyst of rhythm and blues rock and roll and todays heavy metal
2787294 since richard foster and others have led the way for the popularization of the
2787295 this is when the drum is used as a vehicle to enter a different state of consciousness rather than merely as a musical instrument it is in this different state named the shamanic state of consciousness that the shamanic practitioner can receive vital information and healing for the individual or community with which he or she is working this type of drumming which has been used by shamans all over the world for thousands of years is a repetitive rhythm played about 250 beats per minute 4 7 beats per second this entrains the brain into the theta state opening people to receive inspiration and vision when the shaman has gathered the information they require the drumming changes to a rapid rhythm of around 350 beats per minute bringing them back to an ordinary state of consciousness can we all reach this altered state of consciousness through the drums yes anyone can alter his or her state of consciousness our ancestors have been using drums in this way for thousands of years however once they were in an altered state of consciousness they knew exactly how to skilfully navigate within that reality whereas our culture is just re discovering those latent talents shamans have always understood the importance of the drum
2787296 for millennia humans have been dancing in the wilderness in ritual and in ceremonial
2787297 drum circles are growing in popularity in north american society in general and are beginning to be used in ecumenical and emerging churches

2787302 ekstasis ecstasy is from the ancient greek ex stasis and means to stand outside of oneself or to be removed to somewhere else
2787303 listen to how one new age writer defines and describes the ecstatic form of dancing
2787304 the purpose of a trance dance is essentially to bring you to a place in the sacred zone where the spirits can reach you in trance dance the rhythms and movements combine with the music to create an altered state of consciousness that allows entry into the sacred realm allowing the body and parts of the body to move to and express rhythms it finds engaging in the moment leads to this meditative state of mind and allows entry into a deeper mythic reality

2787317 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2787318 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2787319 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2787320 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2787321 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2787408 i telephoned him mr abdallahi personally to explain to him the gravity of his decree and suggest he postpone it to avoid the worst
2787409 the solution to the problem rests solely with the mauritanians we are going to help them to reach an agreement
2787410 we want to prevent mauritania from falling into a vicious cycle where the crisis deepens and the international community is led to take measures that would be unfortunate for the lives and the future of the mauritanian people

2787449 any additional benefits of taurine glucuronolactone or other ingredients are minimal compared to those of caffeine and from what i know are speculative at best for most of these ingredients

2787477 there is an amazing cosmic coincidence that the moon is about 400 times closer to the earth than the sun at the same time the sun is about 400 times larger than the moon what this means is that the size of the sun and moon as seen from the surface of the earth is about the same in the sky when viewed from the surface of earth both the moon and sun appear to be about one half degree in size that is about the size of your thumbnail when you extend your arm in astronomical terms the sun and moon have roughly the same angular size this makes it possible for a solar eclipse to occur no other planets in our solar system enjoy the same one to one ratio

2787555 for they themselves showed of us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how you turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead even jesus who
2787556 since god is still in the delivery business and christ is our righteous redeemer then what were we delivered from why do we still need to be delivered and what will we need to be delivered from still christ our redeemer delivered us from the penalty of sin how did jesus accomplish this
2787557 for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many
2787558 wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them

2787562 the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to the point that it becomes stronger than the democratic state itself that in its essence is fascism ownership of the government by an individual by a group or any controlling private power

2787594 if the real deployment of an american strategic missile defence shield begins close to our borders then we will be forced to react not with diplomatic methods but with military technical methods
2787595 whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a a child a 9 month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place i mean it it would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute

2787608 invasive species are one of the four major threats to the worlds oceans the other three being global climate change marine pollution and over fishing
2787609 what we want to look at is the mass of species along the race route thats the benefit of what the crew can do for us its about conducting research that will go towards creating some better ballast water treatment systems for the future
2787610 unlike other marine pollution from which the environment will eventually recover the impacts of invasive marine species are most often irreversible

2787620 bush will be remembered as the most fiscally irresponsible president in our nations history
2787621 striking reminder of the need to reverse the profligate spending that has characterized this administrations fiscal policy
2787622 busted our budget wreaked havoc in our economy and mortgaged our childrens future on a mountain of debt
2787623 i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families
2787624 they treated us fairly well one person was kicked and the others were hit we got treated better than the people who live in tibet
2787625 they were following us for days and we knew it was only a matter of time before they got us
2787626 he had to travel to china on his irish passport because he was denied a visa to china on his canadian passport likely because he has been a long time and outspoken tibet supporter
2787627 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2787628 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2787629 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2787630 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2787631 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2787632 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2787633 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2787634 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2787635 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2787636 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2787637 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2787638 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2787639 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2787640 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2787641 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe

2787647 as these candidates make news or participate in debates npr will report it

2787649 the election guide on nprs election 2008 webpage features only presidential candidates mccain and obama in the interest of fairness however rudin is working on getting the other candidates represented before the end of summer
2787650 npr is primarily a news organization we are always testing and questioning the credibility of others we have to stand that test ourselves
2787651 american journalisms first ombudsmen the most common term for reader representatives at united states newspapers had shown up in the 1960s notably at the louisville courier journal and the washington post the times however had for more than three decades steadfastly refused to hire one citing the presumed obligation of the papers own editors to represent the readers

2787653 in his development of his own highly dialectical mode of analysis john f welsh examines racism from a variety of vantage points and levels of generality he sees reciprocally reinforcing interrelationships among racism collectivism cultural relativism statism tribalism and determinism he presents a theoretical perspective that expands the dialectics of liberty in rejecting racism as disease and multiculturalism as antidote he argues that it is essential to explore what individualism and libertarianism have to offer to those who are interested in reconstructing social life without racial and ethnic domination welsh surveys the various critiques of racism offered by such theorists as ayn rand murray rothbard the individualist anarchists and max stirner among others en route to defining a fundamentally radical dialectical libertarian framework for interpretation analysis and praxis

2787660 i was able to find an article published in 1928 and it was written by or maybe it was an interview with the president of the us chamber of commerce and these guys are big players in washington now just as they were in 1928 in the coolidge administration big you know conservative powerhouse down there
2787661 the most interesting thing though is what the bush administration has done sort of their signature initiative what they are going to be remembered for you know in addition to like the iraq war you know that sort of thing but what theyre going to be remembered for in terms of their you know innovations in governance is turning everything over to the private sector right outsource the job get you know take these jobs away from career civil servants and hand them over to the big federal contractors who have these offices around the washington beltway
2787662 they would get donations from various big companies and beat up on the left on campus very interesting theres a lot of money to be made in being a conservative as it turns out
2787663 we can be slow as well to give greatness its due a mistake i made myself long ago when i voted against a federal holiday in memory of dr king i was wrong and eventually realized that in time to give full support for a state holiday in arizona

2787666 the class war is over and we lost there was a class war weve been defeated
2787667 the democrats have become a sorry excuse for an opposition party i dont think any of the many potentially deserving members of the bush administration will ever be impeached for the same reason that we didnt have impeachment hearings today or even months ago the democrats are just as corrupt and complicit spineless democrats are neocon appeasers and the blood is on their hands too
2787668 we havent fully recovered from a natural disaster and now were again being battered by a man made calamity

2787678 it keeps things in perspective for me there are lot more important things in life than swimming in the olympic games
2787679 i cant help that this isnt the flu its cancer
2787680 everybody in that room was blown away by his courage maturity and attitude
2787681 the olympics look a lot smaller when you are dealing with something like cancer
2787682 were going to be behind him every step of the way it doesnt end here
2787683 archbasilica of the most holy saviour st john baptist and st john the evangelist at the lateran

2787685 most holy lateran church of all the churches in the city and the world the mother and head
2787686 there is no point in speaking about referees they like the attention
2787687 i think other people need to comment on it because people are watching how managers react
2787688 when you hear of referees summits with managers pictures up on screens talking about individual managers you shake your head and wonder what is going on in the game
2787689 but i refuse to comment and give the limelight to the referee i will talk about st mirren players i thought the st mirren players were outstanding from the first minute to the last
2787690 its definitely mind over matter the body goes through different phases you have to continually resist the physical urge to breathe
2787691 so when i get in the water ive got all my energy for my dive
2787692 i think thats the beauty of it its quite meditative
2787693 i saw us heading home already said de haan after the miraculous escape against usa
2787694 i got a glimpse of hope when i saw gerald sibon stepping up for the free kick as he has managedgoals from that position before
2787695 we started really well and created some good chances however they made some tactical changes and we had difficulties adapting to the new situation
2787696 we have to be satisfied with the result because we got the equaliser in the dying seconds of the game nevertheless we have to realise that were very lucky said de haan to the nos
2787697 you have to start the preparations for a tournament like this six weeks in advance and not all players did this if everybody prepared properly this wouldnt have happened
2787698 our tournament was over if i missed so i had to make it
2787699 in any team it is important to have a technical leader we had one last year in johan micoud and when he left we replaced him with gourcuff who is an excellent technical player who can inspire the others to play well
2787700 you could also consider fernando cavenaghi in that category so having two on the pitch is a considerable advantage
2787701 we need to find a balance so our strike force doesnt paradoxically put us in danger
2787702 vor dem turnier war ronaldinho vier monate lang verletzt doch nun ist er wieder da langsam sehen wir sein l cheln wieder
2787703 wir h tten uns ein paar tore mehr erhofft bei allem respekt vor dem gegner
2787704 es war hart f r uns wir hatten gro e probleme
2787705 we have set a standard now and there are no excuses for not getting back to that level again
2787706 i guess it has given us confidence there is a bit of belief there and we have put the line in the sand now
2787707 i guess we have to make sure regardless of what got us to perform that week we have to make sure we get to that point again
2787708 its a hell of a challenge over here but its something the guys get excited about the challenge of facing this pack over here they are a hell of a good tight five and loose forwards is going to be big for us
2787709 you have to get parity up front the springboks they get on top of you over here and they are a bloody hard thing to stop
2787710 i knew it was pretty bad as soon as i hit the car
2787711 i was sort of hoping i could just get a discharged without conviction during the court case i was pretty worried about having that over my shoulders
2787712 the canadian authorities can use that as a basis for denying a visa
2787713 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2787714 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2787715 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2787716 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2787717 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2787718 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2787719 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2787720 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2787723 from mrs arne christiansen who lived in america but cooked in the best danish manner this cake is quick amp easy to make
2787724 an aeggekage is a traditional danish oven pancake usually served as a buffet item or as a dessert for a family holiday meal it is a light cake like dish that is not too sweet and absolutely delicious with fresh seasonal berries and fresh whipped cream think of it as a sweetened yorkshire pudding just make sure you serve immediately this pancake does not do well cold nor is it a good leftover but chances are you wont have any remaining aeggekage to worry about
2787725 the safety of the rescuer is of a higher priority than the safety of the victim always

2787734 in gaming people are looking for any additional sort of edge or cool technological advantage
2787735 its a short move from gaming to things like virtual worlds and from there into the mainstream computing environment
2787736 as interactions in the virtual world are becoming more complex mouse and keyboard alone could soon not be enough
2787737 nintendo has opened up the doors for other gaming leaders to create innovative gaming interfaces
2787738 being able to control a computer with your mind is the ultimate quest of human machine interaction

2787774 in a very short time indiana has become a national leader in the biofuels industry today we recognize the states corn and soybean farmers who have helped indiana achieve such success
2787775 indianas corn and soybean famers have been valuable partners as we continue to expand our biofuels industry
2787776 we are committed to the production and use of biofuels because they burn cleaner reduce the states dependence on foreign sources of energy and increase the economic opportunities for hoosiers

2787951 the referee was winking at me he would need to explain why i dont know whether he was trying to irritate me or not i dont know but hell deny it
2787952 its so so difficult to say what you really feel weve seen it go on a number of times now and youve just got to bite your tongue
2787953 its not going to change anything we lost the game 1 0 and it was out of our control and theres nothing we can do about it
2787954 i thought it was a penalty and i thought we could have had one before that but there you go some you get some you dont
2787955 i was a little bit worried when he was trapped but this can happen in racing
2787956 it was a long way from home and i knew that once he got out he would just stride out to the line
2787957 it is great he is now in the record books as he is a real champion
2787958 i think he will go to haydock next and then the prix de labbaye at longchamp on arc day will be his target after that
2787959 most of us could turn our own yards into bird friendly habitat with a few simple steps

2787971 why i was unable to contact her back let me tackle the writer of the post first
2787972 putin was saying we are going to make them pay
2787973 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
2787974 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
2787975 there is no possibility of drawing nato or the international community into this
2787976 there is none there is not a danger of a regional conflict in our mind
2787977 strategically the russians have been sending signals that they really wanted to flex their muscles and theyre upset about kosovo
2787978 if someone went to the russians and said o k kosovo for iran wed have a deal
2787979 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got these cold chills
2787980 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2787981 i was very nervous today as its been very difficult for my people
2787982 it was nice of natalia to come up to me afterwards and give me an embrace
2787983 sometimes i felt like i was drowning more or less coming down the climb the first time i was just freezing and i couldnt stop shaking
2787984 i thought we could have won it sometimes you win sometimes you lose they came back they hit a great shot give them credit
2787985 if you consider this loss its not that important but its emotionally important it puts a lot of pressure on you in the next game and the following one so were going to have to play great and really step up
2787986 it was great we won the game we really feel good about that but there is still a long way to go
2787987 we cant get too rattled in the beginning with good streaks
2787988 if we get worried it wont help us we have to keep that in mind from here on out
2787989 everyone is proud it felt great all the flags and people cheering it was a great game great atmosphere
2787990 it was tough in the beginning but we managed to improve and get the win
2787991 we played very good defense and forced them to lose many balls that was the key to our victory it will help give us confidence
2787992 it was a great game a very important game for us
2787993 it was our defense and the running game those were the keys to the win
2787994 we missed a lot of free throws and we made some easy mistakes that made it easy for spain to control the game were going to try the next game not to give that present
2787995 for the first time in my life i have a friend
2787996 ive never had a friend before because ive been in a wheelchair most of my life so kids avoided me so thank you mr newman for this camp
2787997 look i had five dunks in one game thats because of the crowd last time i had five dunks in a game i was like 17 so thats all because of the energy in this crowd
2787998 i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
2787999 it was our first game we were very anxious we missed shots that we normally would hit but at the end of the day you win by almost 30 points youve got to take good things out of that
2788000 we played very very hard we give ourselves a chance defensively every night thats what its all about with us
2788001 we came out a little tight we knew that it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams especially china playing in front of their home crowd
2788002 we withstood the storm we calmed down and we just played a lot better basketball
2788003 maybe this was our biggest mistake that we think on the floor that this can be continued you know
2788004 indeed the hour is coming yes has now come that you will be scattered each to his own and will leave me alone and yet i am not alone because the father is with me
2788005 for the lord will not forsake his people for his great names sake because it has pleased the lord to make you his people

2788010 does anyone believe that it is possible to win the nomination without over these next two months raising all these issues on him
2788011 clinton began to grow angry according to a participants notes
2788012 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself she snapped and hung up
2788013 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
2788014 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
2788015 i dont mean to be an asshole but changes to important statements and other critical campaign communications simply have to go through howard
2788016 howard is the person who is ultimately responsibility for making sure that we deliver our messages the right way and i hope everyone will support and respect him in that role
2788017 this circular firing squad that is occurring is unattractive unprofessional unconscionable and unacceptable after this campaign is over there will be plenty of time to access blame or claim credit
2788018 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light every speech should contain the line
2788019 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
2788020 assuming after iowa and new hampshire the presidential nominating contest narrows to two competitive candidates who remain locked in a highly contested election through 5 february the focus of the campaign will shift to the delegate count
2788021 when the house is on fire its better to have a psychotic fireman than no fireman at all
2788022 a memo worried that clintons anticipated wins in texas and ohio on march 4 would not meaningfully narrow obamas delegate lead a fact sure to sap momentum once the initial excitement of victory passed
2788023 they proposed that clinton from a position of strength immediately after her wins challenge obama to accept michigan and florida revotes such a move preempts obamas reiteration on march 5 that they are still up 100 plus delegates and that we cant win they noted the press will love the rematch like rocky ii
2788024 the folks who sat on the sidelines they should feel legitimately annoyed that the more speculative folks who bought homes they couldnt afford are going to be bailed out by the federal government and these other folks who acted responsibly and didnt get in over their head and decided they didnt want to buy the home they are not getting any benefit
2788025 if the bottom falls out of the economy and we have significant job losses then everything will come down home prices rents everything that could take quite a while to work through
2788026 the singular feature of the great crash of 1929 was that the worst continued to worsen what looked one day like the end proved on the next day to have been only the beginning nothing could have been more ingeniously designed to maximize the suffering and also to ensure that as few as possible escaped the common misfortune the fortunate speculator who had funds to answer the first margin call presently got another and equally urgent one and if he met that there would still be another in the end all the money he had was extracted from him and lost the man with the smart money who was safely out of the market when the first crash came naturally went back in to pick up bargains not only were a recorded 12 894 650 shares sold on 24 october precisely the same number were bought the bargains then suffered a ruinous fall even the man who waited out all of october and all of november who saw the volume of trading return to normal and saw wall street become as placid as a produce market and who then bought common stocks would see their value drop to a third or a fourth of the purchase price in the next twenty four months the coolidge bull market was a remarkable phenomenon the ruthlessness of its liquidation was in its own way equally remarkable
2788027 prices are down far enough now that people who have been sitting on the sidelines are now jumping back in
2788028 the market improvement always starts at the bottom when properties become more affordable and people who has sat on the fence jump in thats what were starting to see now
2788029 the cost of home ownership is starting to approach the cost of average rent
2788030 if the bottom falls out of the economy and we have significant job losses then everything will come down home prices rents everything that could take quite a while to work through
2788031 as the thirst for cash becomes all consuming the bath water the baby the tub the bathroom and the whole house will be made available for sale that is if the house is worth anything that is why it is important to resist the too early urge to snap up assets with even the most impeccable credentials
2788032 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2788033 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2788034 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2788035 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2788036 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health

2788041 the downturn in the real estate market over the past 18 months has hit many areas of los angeles county very hard
2788042 as has been the case in other declining markets real estate in the south bay remained somewhat insulated from the depreciation experienced in these other areas
2788043 putting them together it means that the lower end of the market has life again
2788044 condos are so much stronger which is really unusual in every other down market single family homes have kept their value better than condos

2788046 pets are among the voiceless victims of the current economic downturn
2788047 i encourage families to prepare for their pets in the event of financial difficulties the same way they should prepare for a natural disaster take the time to plan what you will do if forced to surrender a pet an animal shelter should only be a last resort
2788048 last year the first cracks in the housing market showed up at the low end
2788049 while its painful in the short run for people who thought they were home rich its a necessary thing because prices are simply too high it ultimately will improve the ability for businesses to operate in los angeles because people can afford to live here
2788050 theres no way you can justify the 585 000 house median in los angeles
2788051 as in single family the high end is doing better than the low end of the market but everyone is having to lower their prices

2788079 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2788080 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2788081 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2788082 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2788083 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2788084 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2788085 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2788086 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2788087 i hope you will find the time to tell me why this news story is not reported by your paper
2788088 this is a very hard story to prove and i think that has frozen people in place
2788089 i think every single candidate for president republican and democratic have lives personal lives that indicate something about what kind of human being they are and i think it is a fair evaluation to look at what kind of human beings each of us are
2788090 im not going to recycle a supermarket tabloids anonymously sourced story
2788091 there are a lot of big issues facing the country the two candidates are compelling figures and we have finite resources
2788092 fair game for journalism of this sort but this hasnt seemed to me to be a high priority for us at this moment
2788093 our interest in that story was not in his private romantic life
2788094 it was in his relationship with lobbyists plural and that story took many many weeks of intensive reporting effort
2788095 there was a tendency fair or not to dismiss what you read in the national enquirer

2788123 t he whole damn site really is one of the most well articulated pro con loaded blogs ive seen it provides a cross section of how people are feeling out there even amongst those who are seemingly natural allies
2788124 as i view it im a control freak i love to be in control however i fantasize about that control being stripped from me and handed over to someone else namely my husband im just glad i found a site that makes me realize im not a freak for wanting to be dominated
2788125 thank you for providing such a positive validating place for like minded people to talk about this in a way that affirms the dignity of both men and women
2788126 one of the least reported and most scandalous features of the khartoum regimes domestic policies
2788127 national wealth and power to further enrich itself and its cronies while the marginalized regions of the country suffer from terrible poverty
2788128 it does have the potential to be the breadbasket of africa
2788129 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
2788130 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
2788131 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
2788132 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
2788133 one thing was certain that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it it was the black kittens fault entirely
2788134 wage war on germs cover your coughs and sneezes please keep away from children when you have a cold
2788135 the reality is that this happens all the time in this country and disproportionally in prince georges county and most of the people to whom it happens dont have the community support and the platform to speak out so i appreciate you paying attention to our condition but i hope youll also give attention to those who may not have the same platform and voice that we have
2788136 we arrived at the hospital at 2 30 and brody was dead by 5 30 in the morning
2788137 i think a lot parents know their children are protected but fail to realize there are other strains
2788138 this disease is spread through saliva like sucking on the same water bottle as one of your teammates
2788139 there are a lot decisions that go into a publicly funded program and there are only so many health care dollars available
2788140 had we known the vaccine was available we would have made private arrangements to have brody covered
2788141 no other kid in the province should die from this devastating disease
2788142 no other parents should suffer the tragedy that my wife and i have suffered and will likely suffer the rest of our lives
2788143 what may they be thinking how are they feeling what is going on in their lives that contributes to thier behavior

2788172 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2788173 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2788174 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2788175 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2788176 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2788177 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2788178 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2788179 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2788196 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
2788197 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy
2788198 you run it back by next week and well be good

2788203 in a logical world rutgers officials would swallow their egos and admit that their football fantasy was ill conceived especially in view of new jerseys huge debt
2788204 but logic has not been a noticeable trait among the leadership at rutgers nor with the state legislature where the largest measure of blame lies rutgers is a public university and its spending should be monitored closely by state officials but gov jon corzine and most of the state legislators are big rutgers football fans and that does not make for much of a check on spending

2788278 ich denke dass die schlusstabelle ein realistisches bild vom leistungsverm gen der teilnehmenden mannschaften zu diesem fr hen saisonzeitpunkt wiedergibt das tempo in allen spielen war erstaunlich hoch insbesondere die schweizer mit ihrem 89er jahrgang konnten berzeugen und haben bewiesen dass der abstieg in die b gruppe nur ein unfall war der schnell wieder ausgeb gelt werden wird wir sind mit der leistung unserer mannschaft alles in allem zufrieden
2788279 in den spielen gegen tschechien und die schweiz konnte man sehen dass dieses turnier sehr fr h f r viele unserer spieler kam beide spiele gingen durch gegentore im schlussdrittel verloren da fehlte es noch am stehverm gen und konzentration ber die gesamte spielzeit zwar wird an vielen standorten in deutschland gerade mit den jungen deutschen spielern inzwischen fr hzeitig aufs eis gegangen doch richtiges mannschaftstraining ist das dann meist noch nicht es wird eher in kleineren gruppen gearbeitet tschechen und schweizer sind schon seit wenigstens vier wochen mit ihren mannschaften auf dem eis dass alles passen muss um diese beiden mannschaften schlagen zu k nnen war uns von vornherein klar dennoch haben wir auch in diesen spielen ber weite strecken gut mithalten k nnen letzten endes hei t es aber im dezember bei der wm in kanada in top form zu sein nicht anfang august die spieler gehen jetzt in die vereine zur ck bekommen hoffentlich m glichst viel eiszeit und stehen uns dann zur n chsten ma nahme in noch besserer verfassung wieder zur verf gung

2788338 today a free track is available from the upcoming record that i did with brian eno im hoping that folks will be pleasantly surprised at the direction weve taken and the final result since its only one song it may give a skewed taste of the record but many told me its their favorite track i guess well see im also wondering whether the web curious will allow news of the album to spread more or less by itself in the past i might have undertaken all kinds of expensive marketing plans to prepare for a record release there would be a teaser live shows posters magazine ads interviews and advance cds sent to writers and reviewers weve done a few interviews but thats about it it will be interesting to see if audiences find out about this song and the record without all those marketing techniques and solely through internet word of mouth

2788356 in 1985 when i became one of the artists in residence at the national museum of science and technology in ottawa i dreamt up this project about a chair that would fall apart and put itself back together again
2788357 i wanted my chair to be very generic and yet i wanted it to have this capacity to fall apart and put itself back together
2788358 because its outside of what we normally know i think everyone has come at the chair with a particularly interesting take kids cry in front of it people applaud it people laugh at it people are cynical about it theres such a range of emotions that go on in front of this thing that its been overwhelming i thought i was making a sculpture and i realize that we have created a performer

2788364 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it

2788366 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2788367 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2788368 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2788369 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2788370 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2788371 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2788372 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here

2788379 p eople used to say that south africa was 20 years behind the rest of the western world television for example came late to south africa but so did pornography and the homosexual rights movement

2788382 but woe to you if or more likely when the rules change
2788383 that is exactly what happened in south africa i know because i was there and i saw it happen
2788384 faced with revolution in the streets strikes civil unrest and the sheer terror and murder practiced by
2788385 westerners need peace they need order and stability they are builders and planners but what we got was the peace of the grave for our society

2788387 those in the west who forced south africa to surrender to the
2788388 it is already too late for south africa but not for america if enough people strengthen their spine and take on the
2788389 white south africans you should remember have been in that part of africa for the same amount of time whites have inhabited north america yet ultimately south africans voted for their own suicide we are not so very different from you
2788390 from what i have seen and read thus far i fear americans will capitulate just as we did americans are generally a soft lot they dont want to quarrel or obstruct the claims of those who believe they were wronged they like peace and quiet and they want to compromise and be nice
2788391 a television program that aired in south africa showed a town meeting somewhere in southern california where people met to complain about falling standards in the schools
2788392 in america the courts are still the final arbiters of societys laws

2788394 in another generation america may well face what africa is now experiencing invasions of private land by the
2788395 in south africa today only 9 percent of murderers end up in jail
2788396 what would you think of the ritual slaughter of animals in your neighbors backyard
2788397 dont laugh all that is quite common in south africa today
2788398 dont imagine that government officials caught with their fingers in the till will be punished excuses like the need to overcome generations of white racism will be found to exonerate the guilty
2788399 in fact known criminals will be voted into office because of a racial solidarity among the majority that doesnt exist among the whites when ian smith of the old rhodesia tried to stand up to the world white south african politicians were among the westerners pressuring him to surrender
2788400 your tax dollars will go to those who dont earn and dont pay in south africa organizations that used to have access to state funds such as old age homes the arts and veterans services are simply abandoned
2788401 to survive americans must never lose the power they now enjoy to people from alien cultures above all dont put yourselves to the test of fighting only when your backs are against the wall you will probably fail

2788472 we dont know exactly where we should be allocating our funds especially when it comes to real estate
2788473 thats going to be a fine day when bill drives the 9 for the final time
2788474 well some days i think i wonder you know right now i have a good opportunity to drive the 21 wood brothers car and its been a lot of fun ive been kinda looking pretty hard at saying this is my last year of doing this mess and trying to focus on this other stuff cause its hard to do both its hard to do everything you need to do and concentrate on both deals i think its almost like mark thought you either need to be in it or out of it and i guess thats the decision that i need to make but you know right now ive got so many other things going on that its hard to be in it 100 and you know looking at the thing realistically looking at the wood brothers and where they are at being a single entity we need to try to get help us grow back and get back to where they need to be you know every time we come into these places just like coming to pocono last weekend we changed a lot of stuff a lot of things are different we got no practice saturday so we didnt have the last race of running well they had a different guy here with andretti and andretti did a great job and they brought david hyder in and now weve turned around to a totally different direction they have good ideas but its a whole growing experience and when you dont have other teams to build off of and grow off of i know you hear a lot of people say that but its just a simple fact of what racing has become today
2788475 i dont really recall i was hoping that my last race would be with evernham but it just didnt work out what my ideal situation would have been when i said at the end of 03 i wanted to stop running all races i wanted to focus on a 15 18 race schedule well we fell short of that then we got to kind of floating around there and i mean it got to be where it was only just a couple of races then i got with michael and did a few races and with some other guys kind of back and forth and thats hard to do too you needed some consistency you take anything you know about this sport having people around you and keeping that consistency is probably 75 of the game it always has to do with the nucleus around you look at jeff gordon and the ups and downs hes had it always has to do with the nucleus around them you know hell go through a period where he ran well with ray evernham then ray left and it took them a little bit of time to get sorted back out and its been a kind of up and down roller coaster but you take the guys that have been most successful theres always a key nucleus that has stayed with them and stayed behind them i think that is probably the most important part of this sport and i think thats what most people fail to realize
2788476 well i feel fine the thing that i look at is that dale jarrett had ups and upss push behind him that makes a lot of difference when ups pays a lot of the tabs within the business and they can put the ads and put the pr out there that is different than where i am here today where im just running a limited schedule with what i am doing you can put out big press releases and do a lot of stuff you know we are kind of out here on gilligans island doing out own little thing and you know youre so easily forgotten i dont get upset about it i dont worry about it its not good for the fans though because i still have fans that want to know whats going on whether you are running 51st out of a 43 car field i mean they still kind of want to know whats going on thats what i have always said that i get up on my soap box about in this sport is that they dont cover everybody within the sport which is like well pick these guys and thats all well talk about and ive always said that
2788477 well that i dont know that is i will take out here in the next little bit but i am in such a different perspective as some of these other guys its just like mark martin and terry labonte they did their big farewells and here they are back again and i dont understand that you know do what you say and say what you do you know and thats the thing that i look at ive never said i was quitting up to this point and im looking very hard at calling it the end at the end of this year because i dont really know where i want to be next year other than trying to help these guys
2788478 so in essence bill elliott the man who helped to build this sport is helping young drivers and helping a struggling race team is that where you want to be
2788479 well why not if i can help these guys to get to the next level then ive done something well even if they take only one thing out of what i tell them through this whole deal if i can help them get through a few hard times or help them get through this or whatever ive either been there or i have seen it in this sport and i dont know how many people ive seen come and go granted i look back on my career and maybe i wasnt the best driver at a lot of places but i worked harder than most of the guys i had that extra determination to get to the next level when we got that door cracked open a toe was in there then a foot was in there then we finally got in there and go to the next level
2788480 well i just want to say how much we appreciate the sport over the years and all the stuff that has happened ive said this a thousand times if my career ended three or four years ago ive had a great career ive done virtually everything within this sport granted i only won one championship but weve won daytona we won indy we won a lot of the races in the middle there and weve had a good career its the point of and the next generation is coming regardless of what we about it and its going to continue on thats just evolution we live to die and then theres another group that is going to come along thats the key thing is if we try to live back in the past yea i had my hay day but so did a lot of other people richard childress went through his hay day and cale yarborough went through his hay day and so on and so forth you are going to have these guys today who are going to have their hay day but what are they go to do when they realize their hay day is gone and what are they going to do after that i think thats the key thing is that you look at all the fans and appreciate all the support and just be thankful for all the friends that you have created around the country and i think that is the biggest thing that has helped me within this sport
2788481 well theres going to eventually be a point that you say hey this is it i am going to quit this and im going to go do something else whether you go play with your dirt car i dont intend to just totally quit driving you know like rusty wallace he just totally cold quit and i dont know if thats the decision that you make we were somewhere one day and i tried to get him to get into something and he wouldnt even do that it was just a hobby car somewhere and we were just playing around i raced a few legends races just to help understand how those cars are and ive raced some dirt stuff i feel like if i can be the racer that these guys his young development drivers are when i started in i would have won a lot more races than i did as well as total races run when i started running cup its so few versus these kids today come up and theyve already run 100 or so races their first year
2788482 totally i am not talking about necessarily me but everybody within the sport there are fans from all the way down the list from the guy running in the back to the guy running in the front i mean maybe it isnt so obvious to the people on the network and really i dont know the inner workings of a lot of stuff but i understand it and i understand how it works and i understand thats probably the way that its going to be but still the guys in the back deserve a little bit of attention now and then
2788483 just really focused more than anything on this weekend and during the week focused on what is going on with next season hopefully we can get something sorted out soon really right now nothing is happening other than talk with a few different teams until we get that sorted out there is not a whole lot to say
2788484 like i said i am down the road with a couple of different guys trying to sort things out hopefully soon we can get it nailed down and have answers for everybody
2788485 i would like to think so if we can get something sorted out but then again it could take another month it just depends on the details and after we sit down and look at all the details of the agreements and exactly how everything is no telling how long it can take obviously the sooner the better for me if we could just get it sorted out and be able to focus on the remainder of this season then focus on next year when it comes would be good
2788486 i have always been one of those guys man i have always talked about things before they happen or got excited about them before they happen and then have to explain why they didnt until things are signed and done i really dont know what exactly is going to happen yet some things look good but right now there is just not a whole lot to talk about
2788487 it just depends at times i was down to one at times it gets back up to five it just depends on where those teams are where they are with their sponsorship and what they want to do with their current situations there are a lot of guys that are thinking about doing things different for next season and it might be a month down the road before they know exactly what is going on there are some guys that are ready to go now i want to get something done sooner than later hopefully we dont have to deal with talking about this too much longer and we can get something announced soon and go on about our way

2788512 he has dodged mortality by having all these affairs but for him to really commit is to commit to death
2788513 and in a sense quite beautifully i suppose its true when you truly see somebody with whom you are overjoyed at spending the rest of your life with whom you can see a great journey the end of that journey is death
2788514 so in a sense youre looking at your own mortality
2788515 i did a film c alled sexy b east and i do know that that is my anger in the fil m you ca nt invent this i know that in s chindlers li st thats my revulsion an incomprehension that this c ould be happen ing to human beings i know that in house of sand and fog that is my perception of how a man should look after his family

2788521 negotiations with shell to sign a deal to process oil shale in jordan are nearing an end
2788522 if our plans succeed it would be one of the countrys largest projects to help the jordan become energy self sufficient with a possibility to export oil in the future
2788523 costs for such plans are estimated at six billion dollars

2788526 its not something thats on your definite career goals tippett said of his induction
2788527 it doesnt go down like that there are only 17 linebackers there have been 18 000 19 000 guys to play in the nfl and theres only 247 players who ever got into the hall
2788528 that percentage will stun you when you look at it it really hit me as i was preparing to go out to canton im heading to the hall to know the number of guys in there compared to the number of guys who ever played you realize how special it is
2788529 on the other hand you realize there are guys like jerry kramer a guy who was on the all time nfl team for the 50th anniversary not in there
2788530 when i learned i didnt make it i was devastated tippett said
2788531 not that i thought i deserved it more than someone else its just that youre finally in the room you make it to the finals and then you dont get through that last door
2788532 you realize you were touching greatness but you didnt quite get there for a guy like art monk to have that happen six times must have been so hard i appreciate that theyre not just letting anyone in it shows the committee does all it can to protect the integrity of the hall
2788533 the first year i was on the list it was like i was gone in a puff of air
2788534 no one can take it from me my great great grandchildren can go to canton and see my bust and they know maybe i did something back in the day
2788535 youd see these guys on the sidelines in their hawaiian shirts and a lei and go over and shake hands but it never enters your mind one day it might be you tippett said
2788536 im just a player in the league its cool to see but its not saying anything to me

2788595 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2788596 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2788597 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2788598 georgia est dispuesta a iniciar de inmediato negociaciones con la federaci n de rusia sobre el alto el fuego y el fin de las operaciones militares

2788604 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2788605 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2788606 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2788607 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2788608 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2788609 if i dont get on the night relay it would be kind of devastating but i believe in the coaches and if it doesnt work out that way hey ive always got 2012 and the olympics in london
2788610 the four of us set out to do something a lot of people didnt think we could do
2788611 we werent afraid to feel the pain hopefully well break the record by a little more in the final

2788613 estou conhecendo agora injusto da minha parte analisar hoje e dizer que a equipe n o tem condi es a campanha n o boa mas tenho que analisar melhor
2788614 assistimos ao jogo contra o goi s sab amos que se min ssemos o advers rio ter amos condi es de encaixar o contra ataque viemos para marcar o time deles e marcar os gols em velocidade mas isso n o aconteceu o erro nosso foi o passe no ltimo e pen ltimo passe
2788615 its something thats going to happen in an outdoor sport
2788616 were used to this kind of stuff we have to change practice times at princeton sometimes due to weather so were used to it well be alright its just something that happens
2788617 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2788618 there was a very very large amount of fire when we arrived and the extent of the explosion if the blast was heard as far away as it was could have been much more serious
2788619 hopefully we wont find that there are a lot of people missing or injured but so far it looks like we got off very lucky
2788620 i certainly dont think it will be days i think it will be hours
2788621 but that all depends on what we run into if we run into some more problems or problems that we dont see now then it could be longer
2788622 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2788623 my whole room lights up orange and i look out i live on the top floor so i had a perfect view and i just seen a huge ball of flame hundreds of metres in the sky big black pillars of smoke
2788624 we got freaked out my family woke up they thought it was a plane that went down
2788625 he was going to check on my parents but the explosions were getting louder and louder so the three of us just ran and ran and ran
2788626 everyone was just running down the street it was like something from a movie
2788627 we were concerned when this company moved at the end of the street
2788628 but we werent even advised that they were going to be there they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen im surprised that they let a company like that move in a residential area
2788629 those concerns always come up as to whether or not they should be in certain areas but like i say unless you want to put those facilities away and not build anything anywhere close to them any residences i dont know that you can do that
2788630 its been a long week already dont think hes up for it
2788631 utorrent com and utorrent community will exist indefinitely its vibrant and growing and we value the feedback provided in the forums a lot

2788633 how exciting one more crappy ut release thats going to get banned and then fixed within a few weeks its kind of like having a car in and out of the shop 10 times over a year i dont know about you but if i had a car that was broken that much of the time i would probably stop using it altogether and if i was the mechanic responsible for the car upkeep i sure wouldnt be proud of my shoddy work

2788636 it would have been insane for saakashvili to count on direct western military support
2788637 but what he has undoubtedly succeeded in is that the whole world now sees russia as a military aggressor
2788638 its trial by fire theres drama here this is a tough town
2788639 we have many difficult and challenging assignments every day we wanted to give them some practical exposure
2788640 when the time comes i wont be bogged down by fear
2788641 they were always the hometown airline they were in the downtown parades they invested in the community
2788642 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2788643 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts
2788644 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about
2788645 the more you raise fees the more you drive airlines and customers away
2788646 its rhetoric ive heard for 41 years but i understand
2788647 these folks arent sure if theyre going to be in business in six months
2788648 on the other hand airports are very dependent on the airlines bringing passengers
2788649 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
2788650 the main source of support for the u s economy in recent quarters has been the strength of net exports
2788651 but the world economy has fallen off the edge of a cliff
2788652 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
2788653 every soldier and officer should absolutely disobey any order to kill muslims or aid their killers
2788654 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2788655 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2788656 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2788657 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2788658 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2788659 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2788660 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2788661 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2788662 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2788663 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here
2788664 but i was a willing participant you can call it lust i really thought i would get off like a lot of people who are deluded
2788665 the russian side brought in facts about the presence of georgian forces in certain neighborhoods of tskhinvali
2788666 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities
2788667 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2788668 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2788669 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2788670 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2788671 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2788672 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2788673 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia
2788674 russias president dmitry medvedev said that moscow sent troops into south ossetia to protect its peacekeepers and civilians on a mission to
2788675 russian officials said they werent targeting civilians but russias foreign minister sergey lavrov said that
2788676 its regrettable that russian civilians and troops were killed when georgia tried to assert their legitimate authority in south ossetia
2788677 they say im just the pr of their company not a journalist there are also rumors im the ceos mistress i dont know why but when the company asked me to join them and the other medias i freaked out and said no im so ashame of it
2788678 he came into my life when my mood hit its lowest point i never told him about anything but he realized something was wrong in my head and he gave me precious advices that helped me see the end of the tunnel all my entourage warned me he was weird and not kind so i didnt understand at first what he was doing with me i was so confused and i didnt want to admit his help when i realized he had reason i managed to put so much distance between us that it was difficult for me to go and thank him i followed his advices but i had never the occasion to tell him how grateful i am in fact i just fear to say that to him
2788679 i was about to cheat on my man with another one i met in a bar we had a great connection he was really attractive but the day we were about to sleep together i chickened out and i didnt go to the date
2788680 i never make the first step with men because im afraid to get rejected
2788681 i refused to moderate a seminar because i thought i wasnt able to do that
2788682 i never had the courage to ask him to marry me even if were living together because i fear his reaction
2788683 i dont know how to say to her im sorry for what i did to her and as time goes by it gets more and more difficult to apologize because i know she wont forgive my indecision
2788684 i wish i was straightforward and this has poisoned all of my relationships because each time i did something bad i couldnt find the words to say im sorry and that i was just a selfish douche

2788810 why the long face that man of yours giving you trouble again
2788811 thanks dad ill take it under advisement thats not really my problem though you see im being hunted by the forces of hell because i have another shot at redemption if i can manage to live long enough to repent of all the things i did as a demon so far they havent managed to track me down but they did rough up my priest pretty good hes in surgery right now and he might still die what i really need to find out is a way to kill a demon so i wouldnt have to constantly check over my shoulder got any advice for that
2788812 have you completely lost what little sense you inherited from me have you forgotten the ramayana
2788813 the brahmastra the weapon called from the breast of brahma himself that could destroy anything against which there is no defense
2788814 thank you for your help you cant know how useful i found it be well little father

2788816 aunt liv this is dr menken he has something to tell you
2788817 yes as i was telling your niece here mr blake made it out of surgery and is resting in the recovery room wed like to keep him overnight but you should be able to take him home tomorrow if there are no complications
2788818 he doesnt need to be conscious i have things i wish to say to him
2788819 call me a coward if you like but i thought it would be more expedient to discuss this with you now when you cant offer resistance
2788820 i have to leave you for a bit while you recover its for the best really youll get to know brooke
2788821 i found a weapon we can use against them well not found yet
2788822 ive become aware of its existence im going to go find it and then im going to track down the demon who hurt you
2788823 i know you would hate to hear that last bit since youre nonviolent although i have to say you pulled that gun on me like a pro you can relax though its only incidentally about revenge mostly its about standing up to bullies
2788824 stop it we live in a rich neighborhood we live in a rich neighborhood dont you know that we dont honk horns like that here
2788825 whose whole point was that there is no limit to what the actor can do
2788826 he was brilliant in the way he saw human behavior
2788827 that if youre going to take ownership of a character you have to give yourself to it totally
2788828 tenemos que luchar de manera implacable y decidida contra lo parece imponerse en estos momentos la cultura de la riqueza y el f cil sin trabajar sin hacer ning n tipo de sacrificio la cultura del consumismo desbordado la cult
2788829 ten a confianza que pod a ganar y el objetivo est cumplido
2788830 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2788831 the talks are still ongoing theres been a great deal of progress the deal is very close it is about to be closed
2788832 our negotiators have really found compromises on all these issues
2788833 you may hear many dates but i caution you not to take any of these dates until you get the final document
2788834 when i pushed him too hard to straighten up hed tell me to back off
2788835 oh well im in iowa but i need to find an outfit for my senior pictures
2788836 why dont you come inside out of the sun you must be hot we can talk a bit before i show you
2788837 i understand you used to work with the government eh
2788838 i guess that makes you a bit of a lobster
2788839 you know red on the outside white on the inside
2788840 we saw the first ones in spring a few days after equinox they were biting the children so we beat the bushes until we captured one
2788841 ill be honest with you detective when my daughter arranged this i was sceptical i was sure you wouldnt be the right man for the job
2788842 but im starting to think i was wrong it takes a true native to understand
2788843 perhaps i was too quick to accuse you of being a lobster were you raised on reserve
2788844 i have a rare condition that causes me to remain fully aware throughout the sleep cycle monsieur corbeau you may have noticed the bags beneath my eyes it is not a restful way to live never the less it means i am in near constant communion with dream which provides me certain advantages indeed i have not forgotten the old ways the old ways wont let me go
2788845 to live in dream to fly at will to speak with the spirits i am amazed and i envy you
2788846 you would not sir if you knew the whole of it you are thinking of the shallow dreams of the visions grasped by your waking mind you a healthy man have never experienced the dark space of the deep dreaming for that you should be grateful
2788847 um of course as i said we captured one and brought it into the barn that was a mistake
2788848 an army of moos bas rose up at sunset enraged mink spirits exploding from the soil like in the stories my grandmother used to tell us around the fire vicious things they are the moos bas terrifying eh
2788849 they stormed the barn and freed the awa hon do three of my farmhands were bitten
2788850 no by the moos bas mink bites sharp and deep
2788851 but the wounds werent nearly half of it eh over the next couple of days each of them developed this urge to leave the farm my cousins their whole lives lived here on jesus island hellbent ping everything to go
2788852 north they awoke with the word on their lips wiyasakami do you know it
2788853 they couldnt explain it all they knew was that they had to leave right and no matter what we said they went they went north two at sunset then the third the next dawn we havent heard from them since
2788854 the children bitten by the awa hon do did not suffer the same compulsion
2788855 they see glooscap he who is made of words they attack him thrashing his body with birch but he breathes flames and repels them they wake up clawing at their skin as if it was on fire still some of them have scratched themselves up something awful to stop the burning
2788856 they all dream the same dream even before they told anyone about what they saw have you ever heard of anything like that before detective
2788857 you mentioned that you had something to show me sir is it a caged specimen
2788858 we followed the holes from where the moos bas erupted outside the barn they converge underground they come together feeding into a network i guess youd call it
2788859 on account of only a fraction of it being visible right its a tree that grows underground far underground
2788860 its the damnedest thing ive ever laid eyes on if anyone else had told me about it id say they were nuts
2788861 but i like to keep it clear so the machines can get through youre okay to go in on foot eh
2788862 earth movers we started off trying to dig the sucker out you understand to get rid of it but now were just digging to see how far the damn thing goes
2788863 and weve learned to become close through it we didnt used to get on right
2788864 gerards a genuine lobster detective and hes not ashamed of it he went to white mans school in halifax doesnt even speak a word of abenaki hed be more likely to tell you something about jerry seinfeld than tabaldak or glooscap
2788865 the value in that is that hes not so intimidated by the spirits eh his ignorance makes him brave
2788866 its no big deal to be brave in the face of folklore and bullcrap
2788867 if you ask me somebodys trying to run us off the land to spook us eh its like in scooby doo and i wouldve gotten away with it too if it werent for you meddling indians you know
2788868 listen were going to dig this thing out figure out what it is and then sue whoevers responsible thats all there is to it guy
2788869 is there reason to think someone may want you out
2788870 well there is and there isnt detective i suspect theres some mohawks that wouldnt mind seeing the farm in six nations hands but its not something we get trouble over my family won this land in a card game back in seventeen ninety three weve been working it ever since now are there companies that wouldnt mind taking over sure there are green giant tries to squeeze us they come by with offers from time to time okay but they know they dont have a hope unless we want it the fact is we turn a healthy profit here nobodys about to foreclose on us or force us into anything were not desperate
2788871 when we got below ten meters we started hearing things
2788872 there isnt a tree on earth thats supposed to grow this way is there detective
2788873 frankly i was hoping you might be able to give us some answers
2788874 i do not believe there exists a living expert in this no one can solve the puzzle for us monsieur corbeau if we want answers well have to get them ourselves
2788875 youre a true brave arent you you walk with the warriors
2788876 and its just black inside and just quiet eh but you can hear the wind
2788877 youre not thinking of doing this all by your lonesome are you guy
2788878 you should have had a spirit walk to prepare you for this kind of journey you may get lost without one and there are many ways to get lost
2788879 well need to be lowered in the bottom if there is one is not close and if i read the bounces correctly any plumbline would likely get fouled in the convolutions
2788880 weve got about thirty meters of play on the cable and extension give or take plus our rope slack gerard youll carry the radio repeater
2788881 what do you think were going to find you know at the bottom
2788882 here we are at thirty nine meters it looks like this is the end of the road eh
2788883 the flesh and organs have been stripped note the marks of tooth and claw
2788884 but it does lead one to wonder since when do spirits eat
2788885 your prejudices wont gain you a thing down here ger were in the unremembered realm now where the ghost world touches our own okay what you think you know is useless but i can feel my guardian with me now and he will work for us both
2788886 shit we shouldve been the other kind of indians their gods come in numbers you know serious numbers not one freaking raccoon thats weak
2788887 no disrespect et but if a dozen rabid mink try to take us down i really cant see this invisible raccoon of yours as anything but a freaking appetizer
2788888 you say no disrespect but you have no idea what it means close your mouth try to learn something
2788889 i wouldve thought it would go north everything about this whole mess seems to point north why not this
2788890 our spirits not only eat but they defecate as well
2788891 detective im starting to think we might as well turn back okay how long can we go on doing this
2788892 its the only way for a family farm to stay competitive its the only way to get the yields we need to turn a profit
2788893 herbicide resistance is spliced into the dna along with counter measures against predator insects they sell it as a package solution seeds and spray
2788894 whether by design or opportunity something has found a novel way to exploit the unique makeup of your modified canola this compound in the pool its production is being catalyzed farmed from under your own farm
2788895 i dont think it is something unto itself though but rather an ingredient
2788896 we had to give it up though lost all our hives to colony collapse disorder
2788897 some people say ccd is connected to genetically modified crops
2788898 they eat meat weve seen their scat these moos bas may be ingesting the goo but they are not living from it observe the sacs between the shoulders they are filling with some kind of gas a chemical reaction is occurring the goo is being transformed
2788899 i feel like im losing my mind can this be real detective
2788900 i have seen many strange things monsieur corbeau but they were fleeting events seldom more than halfway in this world this on the other hand is concrete this is tangible and real and very very old this is not an intersection of the ghost world and ours this is something altogether different
2788901 we cant let a mississauga do this alone its an abenaki problem so abenaki must face it
2788902 because the moos bas know the way across look at the prints in the mud theyve tested every ford
2788903 not now not while active my theories are spun out from dreaming
2788904 detective mississauga is aware of his dreams ger he says it helps him
2788905 the answers do not come to me i come to them the dreams you remember do you know what they are
2788906 i do dreams are a sorting mechanism a method for classifying and amalgamating data in preparation for encoding to long term memory the engine you use to form higher thoughts is taken offline and repurposed when you sleep it is used to identify patterns it separates the wheat from the chaff trims redundancy makes semantic connections that allow for higher fidelity compression
2788907 normally awareness is partly or wholly subverted by this process in my case however i remain conscious throughout i am capable of directing the synthesis engine and tuning it toward a willful end
2788908 i make connections yes a thousandfold more connections than would be possible for a waking mind i am able to ply the solution space in a completely fluid manner culling for arrangements of special significance
2788909 you must get a break when youre in the quiet place between dreams right what do they call it slow wave sleep
2788910 slow wave sleep is only dreamless for you not so for me it offers me no rest it is a trial to be endured
2788911 the brain never stops to stop would be to die but in slow wave sleep all things being equal the personality is disconnected the slow wave visions are not for you they are for your body your reflexes are primed your muscles memorize you are trained
2788912 for horror the slow wave visions are martial exercises explorations of worst case scenarios they are limbic and lurid all the worst things that can happen to a man are simulated in slow wave sleep to sharpen our responses to danger and crisis a programme of methodical nightmares the merest fractions of which ever bleed into regular dream
2788913 shit detective no wonder youre not afraid of nothing no matter what comes at you youve seen worse
2788914 but im not sure what happens in the aftermath of thousands of mutated minks converging on the core of a major metropolis
2788915 thats whats at stake okay then we should be moving
2788916 they were always the hometown airline they were in the downtown parades they invested in the community
2788917 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2788918 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts

2788923 nella famiglia s sempre respirata musica una mia zia insegna storia della musica e da parte di mia madre ci sono compositori la cui discendenza risale addirittura al xiii secolo e dante ne accenna nella divina commedia quando parla del musico casella ii canto del purgatorio probabilmente musicava testi dottrinali ndr il mio bisnonno conosceva personalmente compositori come gershwin purtroppo io non ho potuto studiarla perch non ero ritenuta adatta a farlo a differenza delle mie due sorelle che si sono applicate nel pianoforte e nel canto ma la passione e il desiderio non mi hanno mai lasciato
2788924 sin da piccolissima adoravo elvis crescendo ho amato i beatles e poi con gli anni il blues primitivo il cui suono ricorda landare a cavallo ed uno dei generi che tuttora prediligo
2788925 il primo cd contiene pezzi che sono esercizi di stile e rappresentano delle scelte che hanno un senso fra di loro unesplorazione del genere della musica techno dalla sua nascita a come si sviluppata nel tempo nel secondo cd il rock si esprime attraverso brani primitivi registrati un po male negli scantinati dal suono molto sporco il terzo disco composto di musica lenta e malinconica
2788926 ascolto anche tantissima musica italiana e avrei voluto mettere altri brani soprattutto dei cantautori degli anni 50 e 60 come tenco bindi e ciampi

2788931 she prepared for this race properly she didnt race every week and her race programme was geared towards this she did her homework she did the hard miles when it mattered
2788932 we told her to lay off before the bend and stay on the inside in case anyone came off and then to take a run at them
2788933 i wasnt the most confident going round the corners in the wet so i thought it was better to play it safe i knew that i could catch them back up even if they went for it at the bottom theyd be strung out and thered be no way they could keep it up for the whole distance
2788934 sophisticated optical devices that are mechanically robust yet fully biodegradable biocompatible and implantable dont exist today
2788935 such systems would greatly expand the use of current optical technologies in areas like human and livestock health environmental monitoring and food quality
2788936 for example at a low cost we could potentially put a bioactive silk film in every bag of spinach and it could give the consumer a readout of whether or not e coli bacteria were in the bag before the food was consumed
2788937 silks spun by spiders and silkworms represent the strongest and toughest natural fibers known they offer many opportunities for functionalization processing and biological integration when compared to conventional polymers
2788938 we have optical devices embedded with enzymes that are still active after almost a year of storage at room temperature this is amazing given that the same enzyme becomes inactive if forgotten and left unrefrigerated for a few days
2788939 brown carbon spheres in east asian outflow and their optical properties
2788940 because of the large uncertainty we have in the radiative forcing of aerosols there is a corresponding large uncertainty in the degree of radiative forcing overall
2788941 this introduces a large uncertainty in the degree of warming predicted by climate change models
2788942 if we know the optical properties and distribution of all the aerosols over the entire atmosphere then we can produce climate change models that provide more accurate prediction
2788943 the problem with this approach is that it gives the average properties of all aerosol components and at only a few wavelengths of light
2788944 we have used this approach to determine the complete optical properties of individual brown carbon nanoparticles sampled from above the yellow sea during a large international climate change experiment
2788945 this is the first time anyone has determined the complete optical properties of single nanoparticles from the atmosphere
2788946 we show that many of the carbons in our sample have optical properties that are different from those usually assumed in climate models
2788947 when you hear about predictions of future warming or changes in precipitation globally or in specific regions like the southwestern united states the predictions are based on computer model output that is ignoring brown carbon so they are going to tend to be less accurate
2788948 thanks to the concern of olympic organizers the chinese government and the cooperation of the korean government we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region that is very industrially active
2788949 capmex is going to be the very first uav campaign in east asia for air pollution and cloud interaction studies
2788950 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
2788951 black carbon in soot is a major contributor to global warming
2788952 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming
2788953 ramanathans earlier research on atmospheric brown clouds demonstrated their importance in how solar energy is distributed throughout the polluted regions of our atmosphere
2788954 capmex takes his work an important step forward with new innovative micro and nano sensor technologies that will provide additional quantitative estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region

2789015 in a coldly calculated political move john edwards has now admitted that he had an affair but did not father rielle hunters daughter frances quinn hunter
2789016 come on guys believe me bruce bob katie you all believed me before
2789017 the political calculus is edwards hopes that his admission of having an affair will allow the incident to blow over allowing him to proceed with his political career
2789018 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then
2789019 being in love with a still somewhat dysfunctional married man
2789020 in the context of admitting to an affair it may seem innocent for edwards to have misled abc about the starting point but the precise date is important over the course of nine months edwards would spend more than 114 000 of the one america committees budget on hunters films whether he did that in an effort to have hunter around or as a legitimate documentary project would likely make a difference to those who thought they were contributing to a poverty eradication effort

2789040 13 construction related fatalities on the las vegas strip are more than the city saw during the entire 1990s building boom but in the last two years there was a difference resort owners and their contractors were building on a vast scale gathering thousands of disparate craft workers in the cauldron of the nevada desert then hurrying them to complete the work to meet ambitious schedules with inadequate regard to fatigue the owners never stressed safety as much as schedule and the contractors failed to scale up the safety effort to the level of the construction boom

2789112 vlad epe ar fi f cut i pace cu turcii dac era cazul n secolul 15 el f cea politic nu se inventase sponsorizarea ca s tim dac ar fi f cut o i p asta
2789113 b ncile ne au revenit prin intermediul unei funda ii ca sponsorizare mai exact a centrului cultural petre u ea care desf oar unele activit i culturale n cadrul complexului muzeal
2789114 depinde din ce punct de vedere privim ntr un fel e o contradic ie dar nu cred c e o solu ie s renun m la ele doar din acest considerent n plus nu cred c n momentul de fa aceasta este cea mai grav problem a centrului istoric
2789115 mi a dori ca muzeele s nu fie nevoite s apeleze la sponsori totu i nu pot s nu m ntreb dac n loc de sultan pe b ncile acelea ar fi scris mcdonalds ar fi fost mai acceptabil
2789116 bucure tiul mi a dat enorm cele mai importante proiecte artistice ale mele nu le a fi putut face dac nu eram aici i chiar dac nu se vede multe dintre lucr rile mele sunt inspirate de bucure ti de ansele pe care mi le a dat bucure tiul

2789159 n sua unde se nregistreaz des atacuri asupra oamenilor exist zicala un urs pe care l hr ne ti este un urs mort tocmai din cauza faptului c n cele mai multe cazuri n ravul de a scotoci n gunoaie i de a vizita a ez rile umane se soldeaz cu mpu carea animalului
2789160 impresia mea sub rezerva c nimeni din conducerea pdl nu s a pronun at asupra intr rii lui n partid este c avem de a face cu oameni care i au pierdut orice busol moral mitic dragomir e genul de personaj aflat ntr o lupt continu cu limba rom n i cu logica pe care c nd l vezi i pare r u c s a inventat televiziunea este unul dintre cele mai resping toare produse ale clasei politice
2789161 dac nu i se arat politicos u a categoric eu nu mai am nimic de a face cu partidul
2789162 n acela i timp organiza ia care l propune va avea un cuv nt important dac era vorba de o filial f r rezultate puteam s v spun de pe acum care ar fi fost r spunsul dar dac e vorba de neam o organiza ie cu rezultate foarte bune argumentele pre edintelui de filial vor c nt ri destul de greu
2789163 este problema organiza iilor partidului nostru care potrivit statutului au libertate deplin de a i propune candida ii n am nicio opinie pro nici contra
2789164 nici nu o resping candidatura n r nici nu o confirm p n nu iau i eu toate datele ce pot s spun sigur este c eu personal n am avut discu ii cu el n acest sens i nici nu i am girat eu intrarea n partid
2789165 mitic dragomir e genul de personaj aflat ntr o lupt continu cu limba rom n i cu logica pe care c nd l vezi i pare r u c s a inventat televiziunea
2789166 n am s l atac n am s l fac nici lichea nici obolan dar s nu care cumva s cread c noi nu tim c a fost antajat cu ni te posibile dosare penale a a c i a c utat bietul om protec ie

2789178 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever
2789179 no doubt that the mood has darkened in the last two or three months
2789180 a year ago it seemed reasonable to hope that the worst would be over by now that has not turned out to be the case
2789181 this is why most analysts are now suggesting that the economy will at best only manage to stagnate in the coming few quarters and that the growth prospects through 2009 and into 2010 look no better than anaemic
2789182 the cbi along with most other forecasters has been consistently over optimistic about the economic outlook over the last 12 months

2789190 if a poet is anybody he is somebody to whom things made matter very little somebody who is obsessed by making like all obsessions the making obsession has disadvantages for instance my only interest in making money would be to make it fortunately however i should prefer to make almost anything else including locomotives and roses

2789193 voelde dat hij het echt meent het is een heel mooie tekst je kan me wegdragen je stem is niet geweldig maar ik wil meer van je teksten horen
2789194 im really glad its getting warm and not cold an ice age would be really bad
2789195 species cant adapt or keep up in an evolutionary sense because everything is happening so fast
2789196 the changes are all happening faster than the models had predicted
2789197 there is much to be said for starting with very low effective prices for carbon until major global emitters also take action but to signal to business that future prices are likely to climb steeply
2789198 one of the most noticeable consequences of climate change in the uk is the frequency of mild winters as a direct result of this aphids seeking new sources of food are appearing significantly earlier in the year and in significantly higher numbers
2789199 we have been studying the seasonal biology of aphids for a long time now and we know that populations can continue to grow over the winter and spring provided that conditions are warm enough
2789200 after a warm winter there are much larger numbers flying and they are hence detected much earlier this means there are more aphids flying in spring and early summer when crops are particularly vulnerable to damage
2789201 all that soil out there are plants that grew 6 000 years ago and didnt decompose completely
2789202 thats what peat is so were just making the same thing happen that happened here for millennia
2789203 we were capturing a lot of c02 at levels much greater than other systems marshes and forests grasslands
2789204 they can just sit back and watch the tules grow and they should be making money
2789205 thats what the vision is its not to do it just on twitchell island its to see if we can do it throughout the delta on subsided land
2789206 when oxygen is limited the bugs the microbes have to eat and breathe somehow
2789207 they will use sulfate iron or some other compound instead of producing c02 at the end of the pathway they end up producing methane
2789208 you probably wont be able to replicate it everywhere because we have a long growing season and we have very specific conditions that occur in the delta that dont occur worldwide
2789209 the first thing they did was to put in huge palm trees that take so much water just to announce their arrival
2789210 its gorgeous here we dont have any natural disasters no forest fires no hurricanes tornadoes or floods good schools lots of cheap land the cost of livings down we have proximity to the colorado river to flagstaff to las vegas to phoenix
2789211 theres going to be quite a few more people looking to kingman once the dam bypass goes through
2789212 we cant say were in a bad cycle right now so we should just stop what were doing
2789213 we cant do that you have to just recognize that were going to go through down cycles and up cycles
2789214 theres going to be another million people here in the next 10 years
2789215 i was attracted to this area for the peace and solitude but peace and solitude no longer exists with 80 000 people living a mile from me
2789216 they said they were going to use desert plants and all this but the first thing they did was to put in huge palm trees that take so much water just to announce their arrival
2789217 were not yet condo on condo neighbor on neighbor with five foot easements i mean its going to come but its not here today
2789218 theres going to be growth here no matter what its just how we handle it
2789219 ive been involved in statewide races since 1960 and leonard lawson is the most powerful political figure ive seen in all that time
2789220 he sups at that front table where its decided who the governors and senators will be
2789221 fletcher didnt have to be talked into doing what he did for pine mountain
2789222 he did it because it was the right thing to do
2789223 mostly just kept us busy in church so we didnt get into trouble
2789224 i know what i want to say but its hard to get it out sometimes
2789225 that was completely unexpected and it meant the world to us
2789226 i understand theyre controversial but the lawson family has done a tremendous amount for me and my family
2789227 if im for you im for you and if im against you im against you
2789228 in all the years i was in the legislature and ill swear this on a stack of bibles he never asked me to do anything or vote in a particular way other than he always wants us to build more roads in the mountains
2789229 well that and workers comp reform he did lobby me for workers comp reform because paul patton asked him to
2789230 and the gas tax he always wanted a hike in the gas tax
2789231 as i look around me a bright sky i see and a shadow beside me six more weeks of winter it will be

2789235 you cant choose your opponents at olympic games the most important thing for us is to qualify for the next round if we end up topping the table thats great but second place would be fine too against nigeria well have to improve
2789236 we went behind early against brazil and lost our shape on the pitch but we still have another game to go
2789237 norway have very good individual players with good technical ability experience and confidence but i still think we can get a result
2789238 if the current talks fail to reach any settlement mugabe should be banned from attending any summits or meetings as president of zimbabwe
2789239 he is not regarded as president of zimbabwe until the political situation in his country is resolved
2789240 democratic elections have never been held in that country and that makes a mockery of their so called democracy
2789241 you can buy all the fireworks you want you just cant set them off in the state of ohio
2789242 they would be cracking down on those who break the law and they could face fines and jail time

2789245 sampling frequency should be at least five to ten times as high as the highest frequency component of the signal

2789248 with idol you only get a minute or so to sing a song

2789251 pirates come in a variety of shapes and sizes some honestly do try before they buy and pay for the games they approve of some dont care about the games at all and crack just for the thrill and the status
2789252 i want to know why people pirate my games i honestly do
2789253 this is not some silly attempt to start a flamewar its not at attempt to change anyones mind about anything i dont want to argue my side of it and there is zero ulterior motive im not looking to catch anyone or prove any points why people pirate my games i might be able to get a general idea as to why people pirate stuff in general from reading warez forums and every other story on digg but im not interested in the general case i want to improve my business and ensure i stay afloat and to do that it would be mad to sit in the corner and ignore the opinions of that section of the public who pirate my games
2789254 since being elected mayor of rowlett i am very active in all of the advocacy groups and decision making groups involved with mass transit issues in the metroplex
2789255 now that multi modal mass transit investments have finally been approved for the city of rowlett i am looking forward to the economic development that they will bring my presentation to the 1 200 attendees at the transportation summit is aimed at encouraging continued investment in multi modal mass transit systems in north central texas using the city of rowlett as an example

2789271 the organizers of orange county chose that name for the sordid purpose of real estate
2789272 they argued that eastern people would be attracted by the name and would rush to that county to buy orange ranches forgetful or perhaps ignorant of the fact that there were more than a hundred other places in the united states named orange
2789273 indeed the divine hand has been lavish in bestowing upon all southern california and upon orange county in particular rare natural advantages perhaps greater than those enjoyed by any other section over which the flag floats our climate is faultless in fact it is not too much to say that as to fertility of soil the charming climate and the scenery with its grandeur and beauty it is not surpassed the world around

2789307 we at abc were working on this story and if we had had any proof and any verifiable facts we certainly would have gone with the story
2789308 it was just a matter of were not going to put something on the air until we know that its true
2789309 we were able to prove i think with satisfaction to our bosses that there was money being paid to rielle hunter
2789310 this began to be for us an aspect of something we could report some hard facts
2789311 until he called and its on the record that he called us on friday and said i want to talk you know thats what broke the story he was willing to admit that he had been lying
2789312 but it became a ludicrous situation almost became a conspiracy of silence by the media and edwards meanwhile would not give interviews was not acting like a man who didnt have something to hide
2789313 i think at that point we should have earlier than we did told readers and viewers what we knew and we didnt know
2789314 i was taught when i was a young reporter that its news when we say it is i think thats still true its news when we say it is its just who we is has changed
2789315 members of the public people with modems people with cell phones are now producers editors they can push and push and push on a story until it ends up being acknowledged by everyone
2789316 they were always the hometown airline they were in the downtown parades they invested in the community
2789317 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2789318 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts
2789319 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about
2789320 the more you raise fees the more you drive airlines and customers away
2789321 its rhetoric ive heard for 41 years but i understand
2789322 these folks arent sure if theyre going to be in business in six months
2789323 i was trying to go after him and throw strikes
2789324 people dont realize what a big out it was because theyre going to look at the scoreboard like its a big blowout
2789325 that was a huge out if barton hits a double there gets a big hit there you dont know what might happen it changes how they use their bullpen and everything else so that was a huge out for us
2789326 im not trying to strike people out but im trying to make quality pitches
2789327 las fuerzas georgianas cesaron el fuego en la regi n de tsjinvali

2789337 narrative games are barely past the infant stage and critical commentary and analysis about them are even less developed
2789338 everyone is still trying to figure out who everyone else is and in this process communities form themselves we are on the ground floor of this effort to try to figure out how to talk intelligently about video games how to analyze them and develop a critical language to discuss them were not like other disciplines im not even sure i would call us a discipline yet because were all figuring this out together we dont even have the terms yet
2789339 part of our trepidation about what to call it is that there is already a field called game studies and some of us arent comfortable with where thats going or dont feel we quite fit in there
2789340 the prime minister has had detailed discussions with the french president nicolas sarkozy and has spoken to un secretary general ban ki moon

2789343 they had been over to the garvellachs a small group of three islands lying west of scarba and had left with the intention of going back to arduaine at loch melfort but the tidal streams had pushed them further south than they realised
2789344 the guys were very well prepared they had the kit and they acted in the right way once their situation went wrong for them
2789345 one of them had been in the water and was wet but health wise they were fine and they were in good spirits
2789346 there were families with children on the lifeboat in oban when our pagers went off and we had to give them the heave ho although it was quite exciting for them to see it happen
2789347 the helicopter located the canoeists at corryvrechan a few miles away from where they had thought they were
2789348 access to any records made or received in the course of business by a health care facility or provider relating to any adverse medical incident
2789349 we feel strongly that it is not fair to open up records that were held confidential by previous court actions over 30 years
2789350 esto va muy de la mano con el montaje vertical que dice que al poner las distintas escenas una al lado de la otra horizontalmente y las partituras de la banda sonora el comp s de la misma con respecto a la imagen al igual que los esquemas de movimiento y de representaci n todo uno bajo lo otro verticalmente estas se relacionan con l neas verticales en las que coinciden en puntos clave en los que tanto la partitura como la imagen coinciden en tiempo y tono que lleva la escena y as tenemos una sincron a de tiempo color movimiento sonido y espacio con la que sonido e imagen se hacen un gran sintagma audiovisual

2789361 although the chinese have been capable of disrupting groups operating inside the country these new attackers are trained and equipped outside and come into china to carry out operations this is a new capability that chinese security forces have to deal with and they are finding it difficult
2789362 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2789363 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2789364 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2789365 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2789366 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2789367 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2789368 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way

2789435 someone call the hospital someone call the hospital quick im going to crash
2789436 mows down worlds of artistic and psychological twaddle with killer sprays of language willett is effortlessly furiously funny
2789437 just the funniest collection of stories ive ever read really funny and perfectly sad at the same time
2789438 why do men like to slap women on the ass
2789439 this way i get to rummage through the empties and sort of come upon the full ones then i sort of pounce on them and wrestle them to the ground
2789440 i like to crack them with my teeth if anyone finds any
2789441 these are premium triple grade as sifted and resifted by hand for a guarantee of absolute perfection
2789442 good god what have we come to where will it all end
2789443 but the more interesting question is why do women like to be slapped on the ass
2789444 they slap us on the ass for the same reason that compels them when they are young boys to run up and touch the witchs house
2789445 when i was a child our neighborhood witchs house was the only stucco house on columbia avenue it was pink with red tile roofing and round rooms and turrets like a castle and an ugly oak out front with all its limbs amputated
2789446 our witchs house was just an ordinary old barn with a fat lady in it
2789447 she was so enormous that she couldnt wear clothes in the wintertime she wore blankets fastened together with safety pins and in the summer she wore sheets she kept pigs on windy days when she came out to slop the pigs the sheets would loosen and billow and snap and the pigs would scatter and i used to pray for one great big gust to come and blow those sheets away one day at high noon this actually happened
2789448 my guess is that while this curtailed naked short selling in the short run i suspect people found clever and sophisticated ways to work around it through derivatives
2789449 if the sec removes the rule it will give the short sellers the edge in the market they are looking for
2789450 we will go back to the world as it was the day before cox testified that the emergency order was coming
2789451 our strategies remained pretty much the same what did change however was the level of compliance involved before making trades
2789452 before we can make a trade that involves short stock in those affected names we have to verify that the customer has pre borrowed the stock and then get confirmation from the firm that lent the stock this slows us down and eats up quite a bit of manpower that can be better used elsewhere
2789453 at the end we almost choked but we were able to come out with a win and thats what counts
2789454 organising something on the scale of the lambeth conference will inevitably result in a small deficit sometimes
2789455 the archbishops council met last week to propose a solution
2789456 i was assured no economic blockade shall be allowed and every effort will be made to keep the highway open
2789457 it is a tragic loss for the mountaire family because it is a close knit company our thoughts and prayers are with the family
2789458 we will be assisting the authorities as we wait for more information
2789459 obviously we want to have as many lanes open as possible
2789460 we are certainly not going to open the roadway until its safe
2789461 its a slow moving process people are getting through but its going to be a while
2789462 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2789463 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2789464 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2789465 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2789466 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2789467 the military institution says it is ok to kill and use the most horrible weapons and that killing the enemy is heroic
2789468 i respect dick for having humanity over his military obligations
2789469 the regular people and the government wanted to surrender but the military people didnt want to surrender
2789470 i believe it is the stubbornness of the military people that caused the bombing of japan
2789471 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2789472 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2789473 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2789474 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2789475 this was a heinous attack by al qaeda in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2789476 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2789477 al qaeda is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2789478 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2789479 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2789480 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2789481 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2789482 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2789483 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2789484 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2789485 so youve got to cut because of that and then if you have clients cutting fees in addition to that youve got a double whammy
2789486 weve been working with our partners for quite some time and asked them to work with us to eliminate low value work and find creative solutions to go to market more efficiently
2789487 theyre going to probably have to make some cuts and look at lower margins for a few years
2789488 historically her footprint was primarily on the west coast but i would say in the last five years she has expanded her footprint to a national level and in the last two years has really put a lot of distance between herself and competitors
2789489 i would estimate that 60 to 70 of all big pitches are going to her
2789490 she seems to have grabbed the market from boston based pile amp co in my mind they are less active or at least publicly active
2789491 you have some old school consultants who are really good people but they dont present themselves well when they go head to head
2789492 catherine is a pretty sharp lady she presents herself well shes got an agency background and has hired a couple people who do too so they do very well
2789493 rigor of their process and ability to implement an agency selection process that was comprehensive effective and efficient
2789494 its not a required part of our process we take a very firm position that we will not solicit or sign up agencies at the start of a review
2789495 you cant really deny that its a flattish industry and when one grows the other necessarily doesnt
2789496 they have a real challenge ahead to differentiate those brands
2789497 our two flagship brands are complementary both with distinct positionings the essence of miller lite is to offer great taste while frost brewed coors light delivers rocky mountain cold refreshment
2789498 in the majority of the country miller lite and coors light dont interact much with each other thus providing room to grow at the expense of our common competitor bud light
2789499 the problem is just that coors has tended to do shitty advertising at the moments when miller was clicking and vice versa
2789500 before we go out with a dell campaign we want to make sure they are 100 up to speed and fully knowledgeable so that we can toss it out there to them
2789501 i think we struggle in mass and somewhat niche media to get that much closer to the purchase of the product this is a partnership we hope that can bring immediate results
2789502 we dont want to make the consumer go off and search google to see how they can acquire the service they saw on episode two
2789503 at a minimum well be going back and touching base with them were not just handing them keys to a shiny new car were showing them how well they can use it
2789504 millennials want someone smart funny and with a slight edge
2789505 has a certain coolness detachment and a slight formality he never loses his temper
2789506 obama is the first presidential candidate to be marketed like a high end consumer brand
2789507 coherent top to bottom 360 degree system at work theres an absolute level of control that i have trouble achieving with my corporate clients
2789508 very comfortable with a very smooth brand that has minimal turmoil
2789509 theyre more civically connected and they find strength in numbers
2789510 the new pronoun is me my using my dot brings it to a personal level
2789511 young people want to be in control of their relationship with a brand they want to customize and personalize
2789512 both colbert and stewart are liberal but the worship of obama sticks in their xer craws
2789513 based on an older image of what the democratic party means
2789514 to the paltry handful of meddling congress members and the gang at cspi wed like to inform you that not only are we keeping beer advertising but were increasing our beer advertising on top of that were now taking ads for hard liquor and fast women any coaches and athletic directors worried about the purity of the game will be required to turn over every single dime of sponsorship money from nike and gatorade this afternoon and to all those division i schools and coaches who whined about this youre all bumped down to division iii and the only sports youll be allowed are crew and womens field hockey have fun further i say if youre going to try to legislate advertising in ncaa ads you pass a law forbidding chevrolet from running the same commercial with the same song 8 000 times per game thats something fans both young and old might appreciate
2789515 we want littlebigplanet to lead the charge into a new genre of gaming and turn sackboy into the next emblematic character for the ps3
2789516 we have coined 2008 the year of the ps3 and are confident that with the launch of
2789517 leveraging some of our hottest properties as preorder items will only help us increase visibility with the consumers early and gain credibility with retailers to help prolong the marketing push well into the holidays
2789518 a compelling family friendly puzzle type game that also is quite innovative and gets a big marketing push is exactly the kind of game that can help take this platform to a new level
2789519 i do believe it will stimulate additional ps3 hardware purchases
2789520 its definitely the game the ps3 really needs its extremely easy to make content so thats going to be accessible to casual gamers and even nongamers
2789521 but theyve also made it clear that the higher levels are pretty challenging and meant to put the skills of gamers to the test
2789522 fans literally had online countdown parties to the announcement having discussions chats oh my god 15 minutes to go to the announcement of the on sale date
2789523 when a customer walks into the store even before the release of that book you want them to know were in the business of selling stephenie meyer
2789524 i have to say we have had a lot of practice executing something of this magnitude because of harry potter
2789525 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2789526 since the burmese military has ignored the call of the internal national community to begin an inclusive political process and unilaterally imposed a constitution designed to consolidate military rule it is imperative to review the international approach towards burma
2789527 a full blown castigation of the burmese generals could have caused considerable discomfort for bangkok which has just assumed the chair of asean which includes burma
2789528 conservatives would be pissed as hell i think you would have a revolt but sometimes john does what john wants to do
2789529 he can be pragmatic but on the biggest decisions he tends to favour his instinct for the bigger picture
2789530 nationwide franchisees have advised our franchisor that serious safety security and financial concerns surround the companys extended hours initiative
2789531 many franchisees are implementing this new initiative although their compliance should not be construed as acceptance of this policy
2789532 as a matter of fact 95 of our largest competitors restaurants operate some form of extended hours with 42 of their restaurants open 24 hours a day seven days a week
2789533 being open hours that are not financially viable is something that we are keenly aware of
2789534 it may work in some urban areas but when you start getting into middle america theres not much traffic out there at three in the morning
2789535 given the publicity from athletes wearing the masks i think its likely well see brands rolling these out in multiple colors
2789536 its a symbol of something that is happening in this country as well
2789537 even with the low visibility you can see olympic sponsors billboards as long as youre within a few blocks of them
2789538 theres been fear for months about pollution during the games
2789539 the images of athletes arriving wearing face masks and stories of teams bringing in their own food have hurt the nations pride however the excitement over the games is irrepressible and i dont think a hazy sky will dampen that

2789577 georgian missile patrol boats today made two attempts to attack russian military ships the russian ships opened fire in response and as a result one of the georgian ships carrying out the attack was sunk
2789578 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2789579 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities

2789666 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
2789667 we have said that this is a condition driven process

2789721 my big dream is to have unity among the bolivian people
2789722 i am feeling good happy because this is going to let us accelerate even more our process for autonomy
2789723 win or lose evo seems to have settled in as the revered leader of half the country and the devil in disguise for the other half that presents a real problem for governing
2789724 is run by lobbyists that represent georgia and other countries
2789725 he takes huge amounts of money from oil companies that are profiting in the former soviet union and many parts of the world
2789726 this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory
2789727 experience is only positive insofar as it creates good judgment
2789728 and i think senator obamas strong case to the american people is that he will have the right judgment about how to balance americas military force with strong diplomacy to protect our interests abroad
2789729 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2789730 mr scheunemann proudly represented a small democracy that is one of our closest allies in a very dangerous region
2789731 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them
2789732 theyre an example of senator mccains push to spread democracy in that part of the world as a very important advance of americas interest as well as being good for international stability
2789733 so instead of trying to detract from the central issue i wish senator obama had actually confronted the issue not trying to detract our attention by focusing on a mccain adviser
2789734 i believe that the international community is not looking to destabilise mauritania
2789735 when it has all the information it will turn in a positive direction
2789736 are under house arrest for their security and the security of the country justice exists in mauritania and there is also a parliament which could be called on to judge them if necessary
2789737 everything to calm down feelings and bring mauritanians closer together
2789738 i telephoned him mr abdallahi personally to explain to him the gravity of his decree and suggest he postpone it to avoid the worst
2789739 the solution to the problem rests solely with the mauritanians we are going to help them to reach an agreement
2789740 we want to prevent mauritania from falling into a vicious cycle where the crisis deepens and the international community is led to take measures that would be unfortunate for the lives and the future of the mauritanian people
2789741 joins other institutions in calling for the return of constitutional order
2789742 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2789743 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2789744 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2789745 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2789746 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2789747 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2789748 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2789749 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2789750 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2789751 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2789752 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2789753 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2789754 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2789755 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2789756 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2789757 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2789758 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2789759 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2789760 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2789761 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2789762 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2789763 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2789764 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2789765 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2789766 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2789767 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2789768 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2789769 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2789770 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2789771 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2789772 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2789773 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2789774 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2789775 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2789776 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2789777 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2789778 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2789779 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2789780 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2789781 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2789782 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2789783 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2789784 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2789785 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2789786 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2789787 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2789788 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2789789 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2789790 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2789791 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2789792 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2789793 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2789794 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2789795 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2789796 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2789797 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2789798 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2789799 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2789800 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2789801 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2789802 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2789803 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2789804 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2789805 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2789806 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2789807 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2789808 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2789809 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2789810 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2789811 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2789812 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2789813 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2789814 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2789815 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2789816 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2789817 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2789818 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2789819 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2789820 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2789821 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2789822 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2789823 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2789824 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2789825 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2789826 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2789827 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2789828 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2789829 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2789830 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2789831 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2789832 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2789833 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2789834 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2789835 only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and im not sure about the former
2789836 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2789837 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2789838 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2789839 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2789840 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2789841 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2789842 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2789843 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2789844 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2789845 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2789846 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2789847 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2789848 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2789849 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2789850 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2789851 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2789852 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2789853 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2789854 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2789855 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2789856 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2789857 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2789858 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2789859 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2789860 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2789861 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2789862 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2789863 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2789864 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2789865 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2789866 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2789867 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2789868 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2789869 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2789870 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2789871 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2789872 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2789873 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2789874 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2789875 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2789876 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2789877 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2789878 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2789879 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2789880 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2789881 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2789882 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2789883 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2789884 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2789885 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2789886 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2789887 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2789888 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2789889 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2789890 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2789891 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2789892 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2789893 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2789894 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2789895 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2789896 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2789897 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2789898 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2789899 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2789900 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2789901 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2789902 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2789903 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2789904 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2789905 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2789906 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2789907 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2789908 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2789909 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2789910 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2789911 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2789912 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2789913 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2789914 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2789915 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2789916 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2789917 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2789918 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2789919 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2789920 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2789921 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2789922 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2789923 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission

2789927 i was in a state of ecstasy for about a week and realized what i was looking for in terms of medication was inside of me it was a higher bliss
2789928 with that clearing all desire for drugs or alcohol vanished i became sober overnight

2789930 pancake batters are like cookie mixtures they wbb in europe day 2 tigers take to the water
2789931 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2789932 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now

2789939 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2789940 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2789941 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2789942 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2789943 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2789944 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2789945 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2789946 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2789947 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2789948 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2789949 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2789950 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2789951 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2789952 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2789953 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2789954 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2789955 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2789956 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2789957 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2789958 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2789959 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2789960 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2789961 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2789962 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2789963 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2789964 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2789965 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2789966 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2789967 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2789968 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2789969 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

2789972 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2789973 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2789974 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2789975 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2789976 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2789977 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2789978 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2789979 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature

2789981 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
