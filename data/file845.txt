8450000 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8450001 on my first record i didnt have a direction i just wanted to make a record
8450002 i feel pass it along is the best body of work ive done this is where i am now and where ive come from
8450003 crossing boundaries towards a new hermeneutics of dumb pimps like bruce willis
8450004 as a dog returneth to its own vomit so doth l a
8450005 but wilson is no mere shock jock and while her revelations about pop culture occasionally restate the obvious they do so in terms so hilariously biting as to render them almost canonical
8450006 fast track citizenship to all immigrants with at least 3 limbs
8450007 caging these animals next to the highway and encouraging drivers to pull over and pummel them with tire irons
8450008 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8450009 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8450010 we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english
8450011 this should be a priority in their professional development just the way working on their short game is a priority
8450012 the lpga could come out and say they only want 10 koreans but theyre not
8450013 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8450014 i must have left my bill of rights at home
8450015 i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
8450016 obviously we want to ensure a strong future for the viper but as we focus on the core business well listen to people who have expressed interest
8450017 the market has changed significantly competition within that premium luxury category only intensifies and as a result it really puts something like the viper at a competitive disadvantage from the standpoint that its obviously a very niche focus with limited scale
8450018 we can drop them from the tree onto a big rock
8450019 they are aircraft and types of accident that are not related to each other at all
8450020 the geographical split has become more extreme over the years
8450021 accidents in north america europe and asia with the exception of indonesia have become fantastically rare
8450022 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8450023 avremmo sparato a obama da grande distanza circa 750 metri usando un fucile
8450024 barack una persona come tutte le altre ha ripetuto pi volte michelle nelle interviste pre convention viene dalla classe media e riuscito a fare il college solo grazie alle borse di studio i suoi problemi sono quelli di tutti i genitori americani vuole un avvenire migliore per le nostre figlie
8450025 un uomo integro capace di trascinare lamerica e di restituire speranza
8450026 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8450027 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8450028 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno
8450029 una nuova stagione di speranza speranza per molti non solo pi per pochi
8450030 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8450031 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8450032 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8450033 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8450034 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8450035 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8450036 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8450037 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8450038 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8450039 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8450040 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8450041 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8450042 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8450043 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8450044 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8450045 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8450046 lindia deve intervenire per far rispettare i diritti umani e la libert religiosa
8450047 lepisodio di oggi ricorda lesponente centrista segue a quello del barbaro omicidio di un sacerdote cattolico sette giorni orsono lue aggiunge volont non pu seguitare a tacere litalia si muova e chieda chiarimenti allambasciatore indiano
8450048 piangere e protestare senza agire da parte degli esponenti della maggioranza francamente semplicistico
8450049 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8450050 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8450051 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8450052 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8450053 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8450054 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8450055 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8450056 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8450057 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8450058 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8450059 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8450060 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8450061 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8450062 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8450063 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8450064 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8450065 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8450066 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8450067 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8450068 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8450069 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8450070 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8450071 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8450072 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato
8450073 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8450074 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8450075 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8450076 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8450077 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8450078 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8450079 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8450080 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8450081 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8450082 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8450083 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8450084 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8450085 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8450086 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8450087 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8450088 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8450089 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8450090 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8450091 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8450092 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8450093 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8450094 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8450095 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8450096 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8450097 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8450098 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8450099 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8450100 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8450101 as an organization that started as a small guerilla group the tigers will retain their capacity to go back to their origins
8450102 the havoc that even a small group of determined persons can do is inestimable
8450103 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 men and 15 women
8450104 this matter is of grave concern to the united nations we have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
8450105 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk democratic peoples republic of korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8450106 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8450107 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8450108 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8450109 this sudden move was not entirely unexpectable as the us has irked north korea by delaying the removal of north korea from the list of terrorism sponsoring states and south korea and the us did the joint military drill which was seen as a threat to the north
8450110 i do not believe that north korea whole heartedly said they will go back to the starting point in terms of denuclearization process i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the us to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
8450111 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8450112 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8450113 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8450114 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8450115 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8450116 people not defining themselves as green doing green things and others that said they were green and drove suvs and had big houses
8450117 that only a small minority of those who want a healthier environment and consider themselves environmentalists engage in environmentally sustainable behavior
8450118 its easier to feel green than to act green schadler writes
8450119 feeling green doesnt cost any time or money or force you to change your habits or accept something new or different
8450120 and asking consumers to spend a premium on a green product is the most hassle filled commitment at all
8450121 he has one stomach and he is eating normally with his two mouths he has one genital organ and a full set of limbs
8450122 he was born from one embryo but there was a developmental anomaly
8450123 around 150 000 people gathered yesterday from different areas it became tough for us to care for the baby
8450124 we called police to tackle the situation and they are guarding the hospital in jessore as well
8450125 we didnt want to lose so we achieved the result we wanted
8450126 in turin we played a great match and the 4 0 allowed us to play within ourselves
8450127 thats normal hes someone who wants to play all the time but i have to think about fiorentina
8450128 i think hes going to be very important to our state and the message that he is sending about the kind of change he wants to bring nationally is the kind of change weve made happen in our home state
8450129 this is an american success story and they are slandering it
8450130 bear down you think you have worked hard work harder
8450131 we are working and when they are sleeping we are working
8450132 i think hes going to be very important to our state and the message that he is sending about the kind of change he wants to bring nationally is the kind of change weve made happen in our home state
8450133 continuing and a proposal was expected to be put to shareholders next month
8450134 based on current market conditions we are targeting growth in underlying eps earnings per share of at least 10 per cent for the 2008 09 financial year he said
8450135 these projects will more than offset the decline in contribution from mature upstream assets such as the cooper and perth basins mr king said
8450136 for heavens sake dont write so much that theres a jump from page one to the inside of the paper
8450137 digamos que una persona en una accidente mata a alguien pero sin intenci n no hay que meterlo a la carcel
8450138 this is an exciting development which completes another important piece of the jigsaw in understanding how we might use gene therapy to eventually restore hearing loss
8450139 it is no longer a pipedream to talk about cell and drug based solutions there is a long way to go but the journey towards new treatments is certainly under way
8450140 however it turns out and however you feel about his candidacy
8450141 about america finally beginning to come to grips with the complexity of the racial issues that have bedeviled us for so long
8450142 this is a huge step this is a generational step
8450143 the word history gets thrown around and its used rather loosely
8450144 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight
8450145 it was like watching muhammad ali come out of retirement
8450146 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8450147 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse i do not know when that day will come i wish tsvangirai well on that day
8450148 this cabinet that i had was the worst in history

8450155 i havent seen anything that comes close to the horrendous facts that were presented in this case
8450156 me encanta tambi n el engine de gta iv a pesar de que no soy muy fan del estado actual de la franquicia no me acaba de gustar el estilo tan y tan violento del juego actual el engine es arrebatador y posibilita escenas incre blemente bellas

8450158 eso s hay s lo dos juegos que considero verdaderas obras maestras ico y shadow of the colossus son incre bles adem s tengo una hija de 12 a os y me encanta jugar con ella a esos dos t tulos lo malo es que ella est en la etapa de kirby y sonic

8450172 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8450173 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8450174 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8450175 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8450176 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days

8450184 we are glad that gfk has clarified its position at last
8450185 with wpps aggressiveness in winning this deal it probably is not going to make someone else jump in to try and best wpp
8450186 when mr sorrell wants a business hes willing to pay up for it as evidenced by the price tag for 24 7 real media which wpp acquired last year for 649 million and a number of other deals
8450187 its probably true in terms of having access to fresh fruit and vegetables
8450188 you often have fast food carry outs chinese mexican or other well known fast food restaurants seem to have more of a presence than a traditional grocery store or even a corner market in some cases
8450189 it doesnt make for an environment thats supportive of healthy eating
8450190 companies are constantly changing marketing strategies over social concerns about healthy eating
8450191 we dont see with the same frequency or fanfare in terms of targeted marketing to african americans and all were suggesting is there needs to be a more balanced approach to create a healthier food environment for african americans
8450192 as the only personal protection spray that can be used directly in the eyes nose and mouth we are proud that myclyns can play a part in keeping officers safe
8450193 i think it should be at the republican convention too
8450194 it just happens that the denver police were interested in this which we thought was somewhat newsworthy
8450195 that and hepatitis are probably the two that drive most disinfecting behavior

8450204 an inprivate session will by default also block all third party content from domains that have appeared more than 10 times in your history in practice that means a lot of ads served by ad networks could be blocked i think thats a great step for privacy but seems to contradict microsofts own promises in the advertising realm in particular microsoft advertising has pushed this idea called engagement mapping which relies on tracking users interaction with an advertising campaign over a few days or weeks im not sure how microsoft can square that circle
8450205 this new series will be of the same caliber as the other two these writers know what they are doing they can write good television youve been with us this long stay with us for the ninth inning itll be worth it and thank you for the five years youve given us

8450209 there are two dates that have changed the world in recent years sept 11 2001 and aug 8 2008
8450210 sept 11 motivated the united states to behave really differently in the world
8450211 that is to say americans realized that even in their homes they could not feel safe they had to protect their interests outside the boundaries of the u s for russia it is the same thing we were sitting in our homes the national discussion was internal now this georgian attack is perceived as aggression and made us realize that we cannot stay home we have to go outside our homes to protect ourselves on new frontiers
8450212 when we are being surrounded by bases on all sides and a growing number of states are being drawn into the north atlantic bloc and we are being told dont worry everything is all right naturally we do not like it
8450213 if they essentially wreck this cooperation it is nothing horrible for us
8450214 we are prepared to accept any decision including the termination of relations as a whole
8450215 re establish with the members of the various communities the peaceful cohabitation and the harmony that has always been the distinctive mark of the indian society
8450216 the state is a mute spectator to the violence that has been unleashed in the christian community

8450218 this is nothing but pure political hate propaganda against the christians when the root problem is of course caste oppression
8450219 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8450220 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8450221 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8450222 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything

8450224 the defendant in this case breached the trust that he had placed in him by the city and he in effect lined his own pockets using his city position

8450226 we do not have our 2006 premiership side out there running around the weekend if that was the case i would back us in

8450233 a return to full pre flood production levels at coppabella is not expected until january 2009 ms hollows said
8450234 market conditions in general are not expected to improve over the balance of the year it said

8450236 with market conditions likely to remain volatile for the rest of this year delivering growth in the short term will continue to be challenging but we remain confident in the medium to long term outlook for the wealth management industry chief executive craig dunn who started in the position on january 1 said
8450237 while amp will prudently manage through these market conditions we will also continue to invest where we see potential growth opportunities that position us well over the medium to long term mr dunn said
8450238 m amp a can be legitimate but it would have to be strategically relevant he said
8450239 we expect margins to contract by 2 to 3 per cent per annum over the longer term because of the competitive market in which we operate he said
8450240 our capital strategy is aimed at enhancing this already strong position in the current climate increasing business flexibility to grow and further optimising our capital mix mr dunn said

8450280 ebay has often talked about the changes taking place in the marketplace and the younger demographic thats now using our website
8450281 we thought lets check in with some younger people give them a completely clean slate and see what they come up with in this way we could see what we need to do to address the needs of that audience
8450282 when we heard that saratoga high school had 21 students interested we were really excited
8450283 we knew students who were involved in the media arts had a whole host of skills and were looking for multimedia projects to work on
8450284 we came up with a list of students who might be interested and ended up with three great teams
8450285 ebay doesnt decide what the user wants the community does that
8450286 this is a great example of that interaction we got some wonderful suggestions with all of these designs
8450287 the use of fonts and graphics was fun and also very practical
8450288 their presentation was very well done thoroughly rehearsed and suggested elements that arent currently a part of our site
8450289 this group really captured all aspects of whats important to ebay and the viability of its web site
8450290 i can take what ive learned at ebay and apply it at school
8450291 it will really help me out when im looking for a job as well normally im not much of a team player but now i know what to expect and how i can manage people better if i become part of a team
8450292 what was unique about the project was that it had no limitations the question was simply what will ebay be like in 2015 it allowed us to stretch our imaginations and come up with some out there stuff
8450293 in only eight weeks we brainstormed created our prototype and planned and practiced our presentation the experience will help our group with future projects both in and out of school
8450294 like other organizations we are feeling the economic pinch this year and are really looking to the community to help make this auction a tremendous success for our students
8450295 we can tell that theres a real economic change this year we dont have as much from merchants
8450296 this auction is important because without it we arent able to keep up with current technology and provide our teachers and students with the exceptional equipment that theyve come to rely on to meet their educational needs
8450297 as a young entrepreneur you will have no work life balance i am very serious about this if you want to succeed you need to be working 24 7 every day of the week
8450298 its easy to be happy for a year or two working all day every day in my opinion its hard to be happy doing that for a lifetime one day youll wake up at age 50 and realize that youve missed out on love and relationships and wonderful experiences because you were obsessed with your company
8450299 adam youve spent a lot of time on this blog advocating the fact that this is not true and that entrepreneurs need to try as hard as possible to sidestep that misconception
8450300 in a world where people are moving a million miles per minute how can you actually tell what someone really cares about look at their calendar its that simple your calendar never lies all we have is our time the way we spend our time is our priorities is our strategy your calendar knows what you really care about do you
8450301 there has got to be a better way it aint republican i can see that
8450302 generally were serving students below a fourth or fifth grade reading level
8450303 i actually think its inevitable twenty20 cricket will be an olympic sport
8450304 you think about the audiences in the sub continent 22 or 23 per cent of the worlds population is based in that area
8450305 the ioc could do a lot worse than put cricket into the olympics
8450306 the critical issue with the game of twenty20 cricket is how do we make it work
8450307 we definitely need a carve out period the reason i say that is not because i want to go off and play its not about that
8450308 i want to play for australia as much as i can i want to play as many tests for australia as i can
8450309 i want the next generation of australian players to have that dream to put on the baggy green cap and play 100 test matches and 300 one day games
8450310 im worried if theres not that period of time be it in the ipl or the epl or whatever competition it might be that this next generations opinions might change
8450311 they might see the dollars and think maybe its more appealing to me that i go and play ipl instead of playing for my country

8450324 i assumed it would be a bunch of radical college students so to fit the part i grew a goatee got a revolutionary t shirt and put on some ratty jeans
8450325 divorce is just terrible its one of satans best tools to kill america

8450327 we are all nintendo warriors today remember that game that electronic game a few years ago push buttons zim zam boom and it was all over with that is not the way you fight war although we as a society have grown to believe that
8450328 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
8450329 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
8450330 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest
8450331 there was one of those six projects that was removed altogether why because the senator and the representatives from that district were from the wrong political party we need to take a step back
8450332 im prepared to bid for that first ticket to shoot a wolf myself
8450333 to get a kick out of smoking industrial hemp it would take a cigar the size of a telephone pole
8450334 i guess i would just make a plea saying we need the money you know we need the money on roads
8450335 i dont think we should let the threat of a lawsuit force us to implement something thats not well thought out
8450336 theres a lot of things that i pointed out in my state of the state address that havent passed unfortunately i cant think of one that has
8450337 all of you with the guts to swing mallets from atop your bike
8450338 stay back nat if you are nat i dont want to hurt you
8450339 no i just shot auntie finn but she said she was a monster are you a monster too
8450340 no im you old man the monsters are all dead now i know i told you not to get into the armory but i know you did and well im real proud of you but you need to not shoot when i come in ok

8450343 wlan adopters are clearly committed to the technology as evidenced by their plans to deploy to more end users and to add functionality but what about the suppliers will the areas that need improvement be addressed there is plenty of reason to conclude that the answer is yes products from wireless specialist companies like reef edge and trapeze networks are aimed at helping enterprises design and manage increasingly complex wan deployments while industry leaders like cisco and 3com continue to introduce enhancements to their products since so many industry players see wireless as one of the few shining spots in the industry you can be certain that r amp d investments will continue

8450351 whether it is the thawing of the northwest passage or the suspected resource riches under the arctic seabed more and more countries are taking an interest in the waterways of the canadian arctic

8450353 as an environmental matter as a security matter and as an economic matter we are making it perfectly clear that not only do we claim jurisdiction over the canadian arctic we are also going to put the full resources of the government of canada behind enforcing that jurisdiction
8450354 we are acting today to protect our environment improve the security of our waterways and ensure that all northern residents and in particular the inuit have a strong say in the future of our arctic for generations to come

8450358 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons

8450368 there may be current efforts under way to close down railhead completely
8450369 the end result is a current system used to identify terrorist threats that has been crippled by technical flaws and a new system that if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system in operation today

8450374 the contract that we have with all karaoke operators clearly states that we do not include any musical works
8450375 only recently theyve asked us to collect because these karaoke operators and suppliers ignored them or turned them away so they asked us to administer for them
8450376 compass and innoform can have a very amicable and transparent paying structure so that it wont affect our competitiveness in the future
8450377 but of course if we dont pay this we might not have new songs to compete against other operators
8450378 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

8450396 this remarkable result derived from the prisoners dilemma thought experiment that individually rational action results in both persons being made worse off in terms of their own self interested purposes is what has made the wide impact in modern social science for there are many interactions in the modern world that seem very much like that from arms races through road congestion and pollution to the depletion of fisheries and the overexploitation of some subsurface water resources these are all quite different interactions in detail but are interactions in which we suppose individually rational action leads to inferior results for each person and the prisoners dilemma suggests something of what is going on in each of them that is the source of its power

8450405 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8450406 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8450407 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8450408 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8450409 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

8450412 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8450413 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8450414 theres the possibility of a category 3 to category 5 hurricane in the gulf on sunday hurricane gustav track theres major change in the track just since yesterday and im sure theres going to be more but thats what has everyones attention right now if we get a major hurricane gustav track in the gulf theres going to be a lot more short covering
8450415 i think libertarianism in a practical sense is innately anti environmentalist

8450449 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8450450 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8450451 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8450452 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8450453 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8450454 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8450455 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8450456 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8450457 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8450458 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8450459 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8450460 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

8450466 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8450467 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8450468 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8450469 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8450470 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8450471 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8450472 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8450473 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8450474 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8450475 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8450476 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8450477 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8450478 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8450479 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8450480 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

8450486 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8450487 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8450488 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8450489 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8450490 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8450491 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8450492 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

8450508 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8450509 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the we need
8450510 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8450511 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8450512 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8450513 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8450514 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8450515 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8450516 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8450517 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8450518 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8450519 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8450520 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8450521 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win

8450526 the results vary dramatically across market segments and sales are still higher than the same period in 2006
8450527 it was a u s proposal for the date which is 2015 and an iraqi one which is 2010 then we agreed to make it 2011
8450528 iraq has the right if necessary to extend the presence of these troops
8450529 as weve said negotiations are ongoing and we are not going to get into the details until an agreement is concluded
8450530 it was a really tough one and i am completely out of breath
8450531 i struggled out there and my opponent played really really well and pushed me to the limit
8450532 it has huge implications for the municipal bond market and for banks that may have to take another round of writedowns its just a mess
8450533 as a result of the late state budget there is a real and substantial risk that the state will have insufficient cash to pay for state expenditures
8450534 while weve had late budgets in the past the critical difference this year is cash
8450535 we have not had a situation in recent years thats the same as the cash starved situation that we may face in september if we dont have a budget in place
8450536 the controller hasnt seen any executive order but he would urge the governor to rethink his proposal
8450537 this hasnt been addressed by the courts and if its ruled illegal it could cost the state a tremendous amount in damages
8450538 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8450539 i was pushed to the limit the last time i played her she was up 5 1 in third and i had to come back
8450540 i was concerned i was going to get my dress dirty
8450541 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match and be able to win even when you feel tired
8450542 when i got into a dangerous situation so i started moving her around a little bit more in the second set i was able to gain more confidence
8450543 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8450544 a lot of the women who dropped off the list this year were for job related reasons
8450545 in some cases its simply a matter of the woman still has a powerful position but other women are relatively more powerful and pushed her down and off the list
8450546 certainly had she been the democratic nominee that probably would have catapulted her higher
8450547 shes still an incredibly powerful force shes way more powerful than any other female senator

8450558 hcf has also committed to retaining the majority of muas staff for at least 12 months after the merger is approved
8450559 eligible health fund members can expect to receive between several hundred and several thousand us dollars
8450560 members will also gain access to the wider range of services offered by hcf including optical and dental clinics
8450561 mua offers hcf additional scale and a younger membership which will help hcf keep premiums
8450562 if the merger is approved hcf will be financially stronger more efficient and flexible and even better placed to grow at a faster than industry rate
8450563 we have enjoyed a year of remarkable growth across every measure at a time when domestic and international demand for cleaner sources of energy is driving massive investment in the sector mr cottee said today
8450564 there will be no pause for qgc and we take nothing for granted
8450565 we have high expectations for reserves production capacity infrastructure and power station development for the next 12 months and beyond
8450566 with more than 700 million cash in the bank at 30 june the company is in an excellent financial position

8450571 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8450572 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8450573 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8450574 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8450575 it provides nutritious meals to our nations frail aged and people with disabilities across australia
8450576 meal on wheels also provides important social contact for people who are housebound with many of the meal delivered by volunteers
8450577 meals on wheels is a huge part of australias invaluable volunteering effort and i congratulate everyone involved in this important work
8450578 the rudd government is committed to fostering a nurturing and innovative environment for volunteer organisations such as meals on wheels to give all of us the opportunity to give something back and encourage strong inclusive communities
8450579 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8450580 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8450581 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8450582 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8450583 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8450584 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8450585 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8450586 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8450587 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8450588 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8450589 unannounced visits are even more important in aged care where frail elderly residents are cared for 24 hours a day and are often unable to speak out if they have concerns about their care
8450590 unannounced visits give an accurate picture of a facilitys day to day operation
8450591 unannounced visits are all about the health safety and well being of residents
8450592 i am confident that the aged care industry and the many older australians it serves will see the longer term benefits of a more transparent and accountable aged care industry
8450593 i will continue to work in partnership with older australians aged care providers unions and consumer groups to improve the quality in residential aged care and ensure the long term viability of the sector
8450594 we must make sure we provide culturally appropriate services and support to better engage indigenous australians and provide improvements to their experiences as consumers
8450595 governments have embraced the notion of a consistent nationally agreed approach to improving indigenous consumer affairs and this plan is the road map for success
8450596 one example of collaboration between agencies was the joint preparation of a guide to enforcement of indigenous consumer matters by the accc and asic the guide provides best practice principles for all australian consumer protection agencies on how to strengthen relationships with indigenous communities and better identify address issues facing indigenous consumers

8450599 the increase in funding will help more people to maintain their independence by continuing to live within their community and in their own homes as most people wish to do
8450600 these funds will help some services upgrade their current kitchen equipment and other services to provide additional transport services
8450601 it is important that we continue to expand services that care for people in their later years and people with disabilities
8450602 many of these people would find it difficult to maintain their independence without the help of hacc
8450603 and her familys from scranton she seems to be an honest person just like my wife
8450604 im not crazy about voting for a colored guy but thats not why i dont support obama im not prejudiced i just like hillary
8450605 oh i love her shes a very intelligent person and she has her husband who went through this
8450606 then why did he go see over in iraq that lama
8450607 i dont care what color he is i dont care if hes pink
8450608 i dont think hes got the same education hillary has and hes so young hes arrogant too
8450609 im not a war person but i do feel we need to address the terrorists
8450610 a serious concern is that if there is too much knowledge sacrificed in the name of short term political expediency then this hurts subsequent framing in the long run

8450613 worse religious belief is unique in its ability to drive its adherents to manifestly unreasonable behavior
8450614 i think that one could argue that stalinism amp maoism were if fact religions namely the belief by stalin amp mao that they were god for all practical purposes
8450615 that does not mean that religious belief is the only reason anyone ever behaves unreasonably it means simply that religious belief is an especially effective i would argue the most effective way of making large groups of people behave in unreasonable ways
8450616 worse religious belief is especially effective in its ability to drive its adherents to manifestly unreasonable behavior
8450617 has this ability in far greater quantity than anything else
8450618 its fairly common to use the phrase unique in its ability to mean has this ability in far greater quantity than anything else
8450619 but that being said let us look at the commonalities between the two types of belief system emphasis on doctrinal fidelity
8450620 strength in belief that is not neccessarily correleated with the strength of evidence behind that belief
8450621 segregation of themselves and outsiders christians versus false religions communists versus the burgeoise libertarians versus
8450622 careful here emphasis on doctrinal fidelity is pretty common in the abrahamic religions especially christianity and islam but it doesnt seem to be a religious universal
8450623 this is more of a human tendency than something that is necessarily a property of religion though religion can fan this tendency
8450624 for something like hinduism which is less a tight doctrinal system than the collection of myths that have been and are believed by ethnic hindus the line between
8450625 to a marxist history or history is not merely a record of things past it is a force and this force has a direction and an end if not actually a goal
8450626 but i have a hard time believing that only ethno cultural divisors exist within it
8450627 i think this vision of respect is incomplete for instance my neighbour can grow the ugliest flowers and the foulest tasting vegetables in the whole world or so they appear to me but id be ready to fight with him in defence of his right to grow them isnt this a higher form of respect
8450628 but indian myths such as the blind men and the elephant have a way of putting the whole notion of doctrine in perspective which is not something we can say for most contemporary science
8450629 and it should be mentioned that there are many working scientists who dont follow a correspondence model of reality
8450630 what i meant to convey was that hinduism doesnt take the notion of
8450631 this could happen to you science is out to get you
8450632 it is a civilisation of programmed separateness of programmed differentiation from the surrounding communities
8450633 the issues that differentiate civilisations are mutually exclusive civilisations will compete with each other and in a single society only one will eventually win
8450634 even if we were to humor the expelled crew and blame eugenics solely on darwinism i dont that still would fail to explain virulent antisemitism since as kevles notes american eugenicists were generally opposed to the nuremberg laws
8450635 its not often you hear a paean of praise to the spanish fascist dictator general franco these days
8450636 much of the moral consideration for others which is apparently promoted by both the old and new testament was originally intended to apply only to a narrowly defined in group love they neighbour didnt mean what we now think it means it meant only love another jew
8450637 you shall not take vengeance or bear any grudge against the sons of your own people but you shall love your neighbour as yourself
8450638 when an alien resides with you in your land you shall not oppress the alien
8450639 dawkins assertions have been backed up by jewish religious scholars as well notably in many reference made in
8450640 the verse from leviticus remains interesting and mostly ignored by the devout check out how internal israeli palestinians are treated let alone the ones in the occupied territories but still the reference to it comes up a little short
8450641 dont ask dont tell what the designer did when or how
8450642 when facism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross
8450643 when an alien resides with you in your land you shall not oppress the alien
8450644 love thy neigbor as your self the evolution of in group morality
8450645 john hartung the associate editor of the journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology and an associate professor of anesthesiology at the state university of new york called macdonalds the culture of critique
8450646 as so often with creationist material im not sure what the point is darwins great contribution to human knowledge his theory of the origin of species is either true or its not it is a true fact that e mc2 and the iranians are right at this moment using that true fact to construct nuclear weapons if they succeed and use their weapons for horrible purposes will that invalidate the special theory of relativity
8450647 if you think your consciousness is an accident of chemical reactions and electrical signals then you dont think it means much and neither does anyone elses
8450648 and calling the only uncaused thing god is not a whit less scientific than referring to super advanced aliens as the giver of life
8450649 incidentally contemporary physicists are perfectly comfortable discussing periods before the big bang
8450650 our lives are meaningless and worthless unless there is an omnipotent invisible entity behind it all nonsense isnt the universe the earth the biota people our minds all awe inspiring indeed precious without recourse to some undetectable anthropomorphized cosmic power
8450651 first atheists doesnt need to have presuppositions atheism is also a natural conclusion second there is ample support for evolved morality such as altruism

8450733 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now
8450734 i enjoy my life very much as a footballer at manchester united and im very happy to be a part of this great club i think i show that in the way i play every week i also have far too much respect for the people of manchester and england to criticise them in this way

8450745 ebay has often talked about the changes taking place in the marketplace and the younger demographic thats now using our website
8450746 we thought lets check in with some younger people give them a completely clean slate and see what they come up with in this way we could see what we need to do to address the needs of that audience
8450747 when we heard that saratoga high school had 21 students interested we were really excited
8450748 we knew students who were involved in the media arts had a whole host of skills and were looking for multimedia projects to work on
8450749 we came up with a list of students who might be interested and ended up with three great teams
8450750 ebay doesnt decide what the user wants the community does that
8450751 this is a great example of that interaction we got some wonderful suggestions with all of these designs
8450752 the use of fonts and graphics was fun and also very practical
8450753 their presentation was very well done thoroughly rehearsed and suggested elements that arent currently a part of our site
8450754 this group really captured all aspects of whats important to ebay and the viability of its web site
8450755 i can take what ive learned at ebay and apply it at school
8450756 it will really help me out when im looking for a job as well normally im not much of a team player but now i know what to expect and how i can manage people better if i become part of a team
8450757 what was unique about the project was that it had no limitations the question was simply what will ebay be like in 2015 it allowed us to stretch our imaginations and come up with some out there stuff
8450758 in only eight weeks we brainstormed created our prototype and planned and practiced our presentation the experience will help our group with future projects both in and out of school

8450774 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8450775 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8450776 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8450777 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8450778 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8450779 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8450780 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8450781 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8450782 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8450783 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8450784 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8450785 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8450786 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8450787 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls

8450803 entendo como j entendi anteriormente que n o oportuno prosseguir no julgamento dessa mat ria
8450804 a perspectiva de reverter o quadro da liminar muito pouco plaus vel j que a interpreta o da s mula foi dada pelo pr prio supremo
8450805 isso fere a norma p trea de que nenhuma les o pode ser privada da interven o do judici rio o que realmente me causou estranheza
8450806 a meu ver prudente suspendermos o julgamento at mesmo porque se trata por enquanto de uma liminar cujo m rito dever ser julgado pelo pleno do stf

8450820 yall sit down weve got to get on with the show here
8450821 ladies and gentlemen i am honoured to be here tonight sit down please please sit
8450822 you know i love this and i thank you but we have important work to do tonight i am here first to support barack obama
8450823 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you that supported her to vote for barack obama in november and heres why our country is in trouble
8450824 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and to restore american leadership in the world and heres what i have to say about that everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8450825 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas understanding and insights america will have the national security leadership we need
8450826 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8450827 most important barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8450828 the choice is clear the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam he loves our country every bit as much as we all do as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues
8450829 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8450830 lets send the republicans a simple message that will echoe from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8450831 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8450832 barack obama will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope if like me you still believe that america must always be a place called hope then join hillary chelsea and me in making senator barack obama the next president of the united states

8450857 we will all be there to welcome anwar as the leader of the opposition and the parliament will be very different with his voice
8450858 it is a real morale boost for the pakatan rakyat in parliament
8450859 we will restore the integrity of the judiciary fight corruption and build a truly unified nation
8450860 its a decisive victory across races across economic classes for anwar ibrahim its a decisive message calling for change
8450861 so how can give us a shot or not isnt timbre seen as an avid supporter of local bands
8450862 the performance was all right i liked the song choices the audience based on what i saw was reasonably responsive i am guessing the repertoire of the band is more suited to an expat crowd who likes the soul funky numbers musically the band was not bad and although mistakes made through nervousness are common they cannot be ignored if the band worked on the overall sounds and dynamics it would have been better the repertoire is probably more suited to timbre the arts house which caters more for a mature audience but we will not hire the band at the moment as there needs to be improvement in the different areas mentioned
8450863 the success of the band was irrelevant sure we could have been famous and made albums and stuff but that would have been predictable this way its poetry

8450867 the resistance that liberated and is still liberating stood in the way of the zionist scheme protected us from assaults and made us proud
8450868 israel did not withdraw from most of lebanon in 2000 in compliance with the 20 year old unsc resolution 425 but under the strikes of the resistance
8450869 no matter how high the israelis scream be it for electoral purposes or any other reason its the battlefield that would settle any combat when it takes place
8450870 the resistance now is even stronger more developed and more capable
8450871 achieve peace with israel by the end of the year
8450872 delusions as there is no place for peace alongside daily israeli crimes against the palestinian people
8450873 has anyone in the world heard a logical israeli speech that explains the existence of israels right
8450874 such statements aim at inducing the insolents on the top of whom is the us to bombard and occupy lands
8450875 why doesnt the un security council move yet to deter israel regardless of the weight of this threat
8450876 we always hear them inciting against the peaceful iranian nuclear program threatening iran with attacks but we dont hear any position neither from the unsc nor from the international atomic energy agency iaea against israels nuclear arsenal taking into consideration the dangers of these arms on the region and the world
8450877 the resistance that liberated and is still liberating stood in the way of the zionist scheme protected us from assaults and made us proud
8450878 israel did not withdraw from most of lebanon in 2000 in compliance with the 20 year old unsc resolution 425 but under the strikes of the resistance
8450879 all powers regardless of their political and intellectual trends have the responsibility of giving the issue of confronting israel on top of their priorities this way victories will be fulfilled one after the other and all our problems will be solved not only the problem of the occupation
8450880 our strategic assessment shows that if the zionist regime took action whether alone or with the united states in minimal time all of its territory would be vulnerable because this country lacks strategic depth and lies within the range of iranian missiles
8450881 irans ballistic capabilities are such that the zionist regime with all the means at its disposal has no way of countering them
8450882 the presence of these forces enables iran to harm the unted states interests in different ways our riposte will be swift tough and unimaginable

8450897 it was worth taking the time to go through the pilot process to really do it right
8450898 were excited about these series and feel theyre perfect additions to our dominant core slate of shows these are the initial pick ups but there are a number of other pilots we feel will also get the go ahead in some form moving forward
8450899 may be one of the worst foreign policy mistakes in the history of our nation
8450900 at long last begun to change substantially for the better
8450901 i felt it was important to tell the truth and be vocal about that
8450902 i think he was trying to say he wasnt pro war but pro surge
8450903 a lot of people still took that as a pro war message
8450904 people are still angry but you have to walk this principled stand
8450905 the problem with politics is sometimes people are looking through narrow lenses
8450906 the watershed moment is going to be the gi bill
8450907 for a lot of people that made them step back and say i have to at least think about whether i ever really thought about who is better for veterans
8450908 that was definitely the narrative that was written that year
8450909 i dont think theyre going to make it a big deal here
8450910 made a commitment hes not going to waffle on that
8450911 over the last two years weve done a lot of work to help democrats see traditional constituencies of the party as not in one box here another box there

8450917 abbas cant ask israel to release palestinian prisoners from its jails and dungeons while he keeps hundreds of other palestinian prisoners in his own jails
8450918 keputusan itu hanya membabitkan satu pilihan raya kecil seperti pilihan raya kecil lain sebelum ini
8450919 oleh itu saya berasakan kita masih boleh bergantung harap kepada umno serta bn kerana kita menang dalam pilihan raya umum lalu kita hanya tidak mendapat majoriti dua pertiga
8450920 kemenangan pembangkang mempertahankan kerusi itu memang sudah dijangka dan ia tidak akan melemahkan kekuatan
8450921 kita dalam bn sudah memahami apa yang berlaku kepada parti komponen bn dalam pilihan raya umum lalu jika pada pilihan raya kecil permatang pauh menunjukkan trend yang sama

8450932 everything in my experience as eight years as president has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8450933 yes he can but first we need to elect him
8450934 they want us to reward them for the last eight years with four more years
8450935 talk about being for it before you were against it
8450936 before john mccain debates barack obama he needs to finish the debate with himself
8450937 i thought it was obvious thats what i meant sedi
8450938 the city supports the firefighters efforts but we have to be consistent with this ordinance and that means they cant solicit at that intersection
8450939 regular citizens have complained about them and the safety situation at that intersection in the past
8450940 who is going to complain about firefighters raising money for a good cause everyone appreciates us there
8450941 they all do all the busy ones where we could raise the most money
8450942 while riding the course i kept thinking to myself that we must be on the wrong road there is just simply no way a time trial would have this much climbing
8450943 at the reassurance from my coach and much to my delight we were on the right course
8450944 i was then able to trace the entire course from the comfort of my home and find a similar route to train on back in boise
8450945 this capability along with having the elevation profile proved invaluable in my preparation for my gold medal race
8450946 hes just getting his personality a little bit earlier than some dudes
8450947 its not like he has a top notch vet receiver over here to tell him to be quiet or anything so why not
8450948 when you get into the regular season obviously its a lot different
8450949 we expect this out of you we expect you to go out there and make the plays youve been making
8450950 with the success ive had they just want to humble me and make sure im a humble person
8450951 but i feel like im humble no matter what its good for them to get on me but i dont think im going to get a big head im just going to keep going out there and making big plays
8450952 its the preseason but there are still nfl players out there theyre not letting him do that if he continues to do what he is doing i dont know why he shouldnt be happy with it hes playing good football
8450953 there are so many things you can get better at every day
8450954 whatever it is i look at film and go out there and progress every day
8450955 i am very sorry for causing trouble to the team and worry to the fans due to the injury i will concentrate on treatment for now and make efforts so that i can come back as soon as possible
8450956 when i got that hit to left field that guy started saying all kinds of stuff

8450964 ultimately any effective regulation is in a sense a joint responsibility weve increased the number of regulators but we also do rely obviously on the work done within the companies themselves
8450965 we have increased the number of inspectors weve increased the amount we spend on protection but we do also plan as we move forward to change the system to make sure that we have greater responsibility on those who ultimately market the product
8450966 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8450967 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8450968 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8450969 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8450970 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8450971 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all

8450975 i never would have been born if my dad hadnt have dropped out of university and met my mum at work

8450980 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
8450981 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
8450982 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
8450983 theres a lot of anger circulating among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger
8450984 i said beauty disadvantaged now beauty is in the eye of the beholder
8450985 we carried out an analysis of what pete doherty and his band does
8450986 what he does as part of his routine is to gee up the crowd they speed up and then slow down the music and create a whirlpool effect in the crowd
8450987 they the crowd all get geed up and then they start fighting
8450988 since the beginning of this mobilization we have always said that any violence would not come from us but would come from the police our predictions appear to have come true
8450989 in my mind last season we exceeded expectations by a long way
8450990 we lost 10 players in the transition between coaching staffs and to lose cat walker in the very first scrimmage was a big blow my expectations last year were that we would be a hard working team and we would have great team chemistry we exceeded both of those with nine wins we won a lot of those games based on those two things alone
8450991 this should allow us to take more chances as far as getting forward were also more technical last year was great because we had 11 shutouts something well try to do again this season the biggest improvement ive seen is our ability to score a lot more goals i think we will have the ability to maintain more possession so that will save our legs a little bit in the attacking third
8450992 i believe heather is going to have a very good year
8450993 she struggled a little bit last season because she didnt have a lot of support i think having cat walker and jessica gordon back in the lineup will give her more service so im expecting her to score a decent amount of goals this season she has the ability to finish for us
8450994 alicias very quick and has the ability to maintain possession for our team
8450995 she also does well when we are in the attacking third being able to break teams down on the dribble i expect her to have a decent amount of assists this year as well as contributing to our goal scoring
8450996 we really missed her up top last year she has the ability to score a lot of goals and is a very good finisher shes extremely quick and has a great attacking mentality
8450997 shes regained her explosiveness back from 2006 she has the ability to take people one on on and is good on the dribble were looking at her not only for goal production but to create a lot of chances
8450998 ali has really improved in the offseason on her one on one defending
8450999 she is fast physical and is very good in the air im expecting her to be a dominant force in the air not just defensively but on some of our offensive set pieces were very excited about her potential this year
8451000 she gives us another player who will fulfill the role of a ball winner
8451001 tiffany will most likely be starting as a freshman in central midfield
8451002 she has a very good understanding of the game for such a young player and will give us another quality player on the field
8451003 millie is a leader both on and off the field
8451004 she is a physical presence who also has the ability to calm our team down when we have the ball shes a very aggressive and physical player but at the same time a very technical player
8451005 jillian should start the season out at the right back position
8451006 shes a composed player and has the ability to maintain possession she will also be taking some set pieces as well
8451007 she has the ability to win a lot of headers and were looking for her to fill the void left by the graduation of jessica girdner were looking at her to be an enforcer in the midfield and when shes in back
8451008 were hoping by mid season that daniela will be healthy and give us some depth on our back line
8451009 shes good in the air and i expect her to contribute at the center back position when shes healthy
8451010 gretel amman will start for us at the center back position as a freshman
8451011 she is very athletic is good on the ball and reads the game extremely well she will have to grow up pretty fast along with megan mcqueeny because were throwing them into the fire right away megan is extremely athletic and is a very good very physical one on one defender teams are going to have a difficult time getting behind us with her presence
8451012 as a result shes reading the game better and has expanded her skills to affect the game in broader scope shes very good with her feet which releases a lot of pressure from our back line and is vocal in directing the back line im always confident when shes back there
8451013 well when ones lost i suppose its good advice to stay where you are until someone finds you but whod ever think to look for me here
8451014 we recognise the growth of global wealth and affluent individuals around the world and coupled with our understanding of this segment we can elevate luxury living to a new stratum by establishing the stein brands in asia

8451016 we are very excited about working with kop capital in establishing and expanding stein group internationals brands in asia
8451017 even passers by recognise her face and cant help noticing her
8451018 she is quite nervous right now because she never experienced this much attention

8451026 your iphone is out of warranty so you cannot get hardware support just technical support
8451027 im so sorry apple really regrets this happening to users
8451028 you are telling me that my hardware problem started at exactly the same time as the upgrade to 2 0
8451029 well i know it sounds crazy but yes your hardware has gone bad and it just happened to go bad at the same time as the update
8451030 its not supported and you would void any warranty you have
8451031 computer asked me some 1 answer questions and then shipped me off to at amp t because the answers i gave led the

8451033 these two cases in texas are just the tip of the iceberg
8451034 across texas and around the country people are convicted of arson based on junk science that has been completely discredited for years
8451035 dna is the truth in my case we also have a man that confessed that he did the crime you cant get the truth any better than that
8451036 com os olhos fixos no futuro em nome da uni o com o objetivo da vit ria com f em nosso partido e em nosso pa s vamos declarar com uma s voz aqui e agora que barack obama o nosso candidato e ele ser o nosso presidente
8451037 sorry you completed the survey faster then 95 of the other survey participants so we feel that you did not give enough thought to your answers
8451038 they have sweatsuits and cheerleader sweatshirts they can wear with their jeans and if we have a pep rally or something they can go and change
8451039 as we live in the wonderful country that we live in many people have different interpretations of what fits within their community
8451040 we expect them to dress modestly but at the same time we recognize they are wearing cheerleading outfits
8451041 clearly constitutes a threat to the health and safety of students or disrupts the educational process will be prohibited
8451042 though he was only at our school for a short time his death is a loss to us all
8451043 were like a family here at mississauga secondary school and we all feel saddened by this tragedy
8451044 one of the advantages of our method is that it takes into account both people and places
8451045 for instance with unemployment we can say that people who are unemployed are on average happier in an area of high unemployment compared to being unemployed in an area where everyone else around you has a job
8451046 from what ive seen so far my view is that if an area is more socially cohesive it increases your chances of having good quality of interpersonal relationships and a good social network
8451047 if you live in an area which is very unequal and polarised then you are less likely to have good social networks and friends
8451048 to what extent we can talk about happy people or happy places is it the place or the people my guess would be its a bit of both
8451049 the variance that is attributed to the place you live in is perhaps higher than our research suggests your immediate surroundings are very important in terms of happiness
8451050 they pride themselves on being a new breed of news delivery
8451051 media organizations pay hundreds of thousands to millions for photos and video footage
8451052 people magazine notoriously paid over 10 million for brad pitt and angelina jolies baby photos
8451053 it looks like wikileaks is still looking for the optimal method to distribute its materials
8451054 i think it will automatically rule out publications like the new york times and others that might devote significant attention to an in depth look at such internal e mails but would not pay for them
8451055 whether u s media outlets are cheap or have ethics i dont know
8451056 the degree to which news organizations refuse to pay for the news is proportional to the degree to which they are able to bilk the public with unworthy alternatives
8451057 indeed for anyone who has been in the news business for a while knows manufacture of news is so arbitrary the result must be described primarily as mere entertainment
8451058 good for them we live in a capitalist country everything has a dollar value even ethical behavior so get over it lets see what is going on behind the scenes with hugo and the gang
8451059 a evolu o das coisas teis clipes garfos latas z peres e outros objetos de nosso cotidiano
8451060 more impressed by the power of our example than the example of our power
8451061 i always said that the more that axl and geffen jerked around trying to figure out how to release this finally finished album that weve all been waiting over 13 years for the greater the chances would be that it would slip out of a pressing plant or office somewhere and wind up in the hands of some asshole with a blog
8451062 weve got to make those plays just like the offense and defense
8451063 id like to think he could have a breakout year or certainly better than last year we need him to be better this year
8451064 slowing down a little bit not being so quick into the ball
8451065 ive got to hit more of those down the middle if i slow down ill be better off there
8451066 i dont want to put it all on mike but for whatever reason the chemistry never came about
8451067 neil would tell you he should have handled it better but that was a factor
8451068 you know what if i get it great and if i dont get it thats great too
8451069 oh well joe biden is actually going to be in charge of foreign affairs because barack obama doesnt have the experience joe biden does oh my goodness were going to have another cheney situation
8451070 in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama
8451071 everything i have learned has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8451072 the long hard primary toughened and strengthened him and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8451073 barack obama is ready to lead barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8451074 the power of our example than by the example of our power
8451075 are these the family values the republicans are so proud of
8451076 america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8451077 yes he can but first we have to elect him the choice is clear the republicans in a few days will nominate a good man he loves his country every bit as much as we do
8451078 extreme philosophy that has defined his party for more than 25 years
8451079 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more in this case the third time is not the charm
8451080 793 amarissa on 08 27 08 at 9 26 pm we lost another one bill joined in this is breaking my heart i know this is what they have to do but i think they are taking it a bit too far do they know something we dont if 61 is found guilty of something they will be discredited for pushing him
8451081 last night hillary came out in her orange pantsuit and i giggled about the possible subliminal message
8451082 has anyone ever googled mccain songbird and read any of the stuff there does any of it sound credible
8451083 ben carlson on august 27th 2008 at 11 41 pm said in thinking pawlenty he was a headliner at a republican dinner the other night in akron ohio where i live he was quite good he has humble beginnings and an attractive family but fiorina would really be able to address the economy
8451084 ben carlson on may 19th 2008 at 4 38 pm said
8451085 that sounds a lot like when al gore said he wasnt in the room when the illegal fundraising was going on in the clinton white house i think he said he was drinking too much iced tea and was in the loo you can not be the post racial candidate and belong to a church like this
8451086 24 livinggrace on 08 27 08 at 11 29 pm maybe i am just very tired and i do have a bad cold of some sort but im not sure what im feeling i know that i dont want to feel anger or hatred i am not called to that i lean more toward reconciliation and compromise these are changing times desperate times and people truly are struggling i have been one who didnt like mo and cant say that i really do now but i saw her crying tonight as bidens son spoke about the loss of his mother and how his father stood by him and his brother and noticed that i was crying too much of what bill clinton said also seemed to make sense when he finished i was left with a feeling that ok we fought a good fight like hillary did but this time our side did not prevail if i really believe that my country comes before party just exactly defines that at this point to me i mean in many other areas of my life i have come to learn that acceptance is the answer to all my problems whenever i find some person place thing or situation unacceptable to me i can find no peace no serenity or peace of mind until i accept that person place thing or situation as being just exactly the way it is supoosed to be this moment there is a god a higher power and it isnt me the world does not revolve around me and i dont control anything but me and that not very well here as members of puma we have learned to put ourdifferences aside accept one another as we are and work for a common cause tonight im wondering if im big enough to do it again for the sake of the country and stop fighting it really looks like we are going to see our first black president in america like others i so want to see a woman elected potus in my lifetime but progress is progress and my own parents didnt live to see either one ok i am tired and i am sick and these are my thoughts tonight as i say good night may the creator bless you all with all good things in life
8451087 103 oneof18million cracks on 08 28 08 at 12 42 am
8451088 when bill clinton was running for president 16 years ago we were young and so uninformed we were enamored with him he spoke of how he wanted to make america a better place for all and so now its the younger generation who has seen the iraq war fear they may be called up to join and see their parents and grandparents struggling so it makes sense they would see barrack obama as our bill clinton
8451089 be careful what you wish for you may get it and realize it wasnt what you thought it would be
8451090 sen barack obama has never done anything where he had to make difficult decisions hes never run a city hes never run a state hes never run a government of any kind
8451091 hes never run an agency hes never run a business
8451092 i think i have the same reservations that hillary clinton has during the debate last year when he asked what hed do if an american city was attacked and he said hed check the emergency response system and the democrats all pointed out that was a rather na ve and irresponsible way to approach it
8451093 the democratic party has nominated someone that they believe is not ready to be president of the united states
8451094 nobody cares about what the republicans are doing everybody understands that they are so desperate reaching so far that theyre just off base
8451095 hes not even a viable pit bull as far as going on the attack is concerned because rudy giuliani is really irrelevant
8451096 rudy you need to give it up youre not going to mess up the party because we are so powerful and strong and after hillarys speech last night we can do it we can do it we can do it
8451097 obamas narrative is being altered enhanced and manipulated to whitewash troubling facts
8451098 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8451099 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8451100 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8451101 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8451102 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8451103 securing virtual worlds against real attacks the challenges of online game development

8451105 she was a good cadet though there was one occasion when i had to make her drop and give me ten push ups we laugh about it now i think shes forgiven me
8451106 it is their dynamism which plays a key role in the development of our country which starts at the very hearts of our small communities
8451107 kung hindi sana malawak ang corruption sana nakabili tayo ng maraming airplane sa paf ang problema sa pag release ng budget for the afp at executive branch kung saan napupunta ang pondo kung siguro mawala o mabawasan nang malaki ang corruption siguro makakabili tayo maraming equipment if corruption were not so widespread we could have acquired more planes the problem in releasing a big budget is that a big part of the funds would disappear if we can curb corruption we can get more equipment
8451108 ako nagsabi na dapat suportahan ang afp but again kailangan tanungin sila paano gagastusin magkano kailangan nila at paano nila gagastusin kasama na rin doon paano ginastos ang budget na binigay sa kanila pero dapat suportahan lang kasi malaki ang momentum nila i already said we should support the military but we should be sure the funds for the supplemental budget will be spent wisely

8451115 mom our life together has been more than enough your love is all i ever needed i wish you enough too mom
8451116 did you ever say good bye to someone knowing it would be forever
8451117 forgive me for asking but why is this a forever good bye
8451118 i am old and she lives so far away i have challenges ahead and the reality is the next trip back will be for my funeral
8451119 when you were saying good bye i heard you say i wish you enough may i ask what that means
8451120 thats a wish that has been handed down from other generations my parents used to say it to everyone
8451121 when we said i wish you enough we were wanting the other person to have a life filled with just enough good things to sustain them
8451122 shes just such a great person im excited to see what she does in her life

8451133 our soccer team won the gold medal in martial arts
8451134 china has had a weird year with a freak snowstorm the tibetan riots and an earthquake but the performance of our soccer team shows that some things never change
8451135 our strikers did such a great job that i even told them they should start playing for our mens team now
8451136 its so beyond an embarrassment that it almost seems like a comedy
8451137 weve cried our tears dry and now its time for us to enjoy the big show because you never know how our team is going to lose this time
8451138 without rule of law corruption will get involved and nobody is responsible to anyone
8451139 if chinese continue to be obsessed with soccer theyll definitely demand something dramatic something political or involving rule of law it will start with sports and then it will move onto something bigger
8451140 it represents the most outdated management system that still exists in this country
8451141 you cant run a soccer team the same way you train table tennis players which is exactly what theyre doing right now
8451142 they enjoy playing soccer while the chinese view it as a fight
8451143 the chinese people have intense wishes for a strong chinese team but we need more tolerance and time
8451144 like you we also want to improve to make a change
8451145 salmon were slammin spoons off of the pier earlier this week at holland
8451146 by the second weekend of september the rivers should start loading up with fish
8451147 some fish have already moved into the river but we have a few weeks to go before the action gets hot
8451148 when the water temperatures were warm we were fishing deep with lead core line and spin doctors for the salmon
8451149 now our best luck has been on downriggers and spoons
8451150 but it has eyes and stick arms and legs and you know a woo hoo
8451151 who knows what she really thinks with all the missteps that have taken place this is the only thing she could do so yes im still bitter
8451152 i hate obama so much that im going to devote as much time to mccain as i did to hillary
8451153 obama has nothing he has no experience the democratic party doesnt care about us you couldnt treat clinton any worse
8451154 we really are taking a position of being indifferent to obama
8451155 i was sitting up at the lounge laid my tomahawk on the bar
8451156 i went back to the bar to get my tomahawk and it was gone
8451157 im in tears i want my tomahawk man you know dont take it
8451158 thats a part of me thats history i dont like it you see chills coming on my arm
8451159 it was a shame i hope whoever has it will please return it
8451160 were asking you to look around call and let us know
8451161 dont worry until i worry i feel good about the choice we made as far as coaching
8451162 im pretty sure that ill have a tomahawk but it wont be like 21

8451166 i know ive heard people tell me theyre interested in leasing it from the city and operating it
8451167 i think everythings on the table in my opinion because weve got to cut corners weve got to save the taxpayer money and be responsive
8451168 theyre not beholden to labor contracts and could operate and give the same service at less of a draw on our budget
8451169 for me the important thing wasnt about rights or the benefits
8451170 i just wanted the tribe to say yes we recognize that you are just as important as any other tribe member and we will treat you and your spouse as we treat all tribal members
8451171 it can do anything good or anything bad to the tribes and the indian people as citizen indians
8451172 for our tribe we want people to walk in the shoes of other people and learn to respect differences
8451173 we have been approached by third parties who are interested in exploring future possibilities for viper

8451175 has not set a definitive timetable for completion of the review of its strategic options no final decision has been made with regard to the viper business and there can be no assurance that any transaction will take place as a result of this process
8451176 dodge viper continues through the product life cycle no future product identified company plans to close facility during term of agreement

8451178 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8451179 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8451180 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8451181 for all of dels life she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant
8451182 her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years
8451183 in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved
8451184 no secret anymore the times of del martin and phyllis lyon
8451185 if we had a secret we would have written a book and made a million dollars
8451186 we love each other we have similar interests our lives were very similar even before we met
8451187 i think today marriage as an institution has been strengthened
8451188 being able to help make changes in the way lesbians and gay men view themselves and how the larger society views lesbians and gay men

8451190 hallmark the venerable greeting card company is doing nationwide what 48 states and the federal government have refused to do and that is to recognize homosexual marriage
8451191 previous studies have showed that the steep decline begins around five years before death
8451192 what we could see in our data is that these changes occur much earlier than thought
8451193 there is substantial acceleration in cognitive decline many years prior to death among individuals without dementia

8451206 geddins wanted people to remember what the old blues sounded like and that would induce them to go out and buy it
8451207 that was the opposite view to what other producers thought which was that black people would avoid the music because they didnt want to be reminded of being back home and working in the cotton fields

8451218 we found the citys restaurants to be excellent featuring the best ingredients culinary talents and a tradition passed on from generation to generation and refined by todays chefs
8451219 i dont think it is helpful to make that kind of statement
8451220 tokyo has the best japanese food in the world but it is nowhere near as diverse as other cities
8451221 i think we can call it the culinary capital of the world

8451246 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8451247 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8451248 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8451249 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8451250 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8451258 no where do the refund details printed on the receipt make any mention of having to pay anything in regards to receiving a refund nor do they make any note of this
8451259 why doesnt your company put any effort into making things easier for its customers this refund policy is a perfect example that you dont give a shit about the people you serve i know damn well you can cancel one of your money orders barring it hasnt already been claimed however if you did that then you wouldnt have the opportunity to present this bullshit money order guarantee charge to me would you furthermore the only reason it would take this sorry excuse of a company two full months to investigate track a money order is because youre most likely inundated with countless cases claims of either damaged or lost packages plus this company has a tendency of delivering mail to the wrong address completely for instance two months ago i received a new york womens cable bill ive receive numerous house cleaning and cell phone bills that should have been sent to a residence in ohio last christmas a record i had bought as a gift for a friend was delivered to a house two blocks away and thats not to mention all of the christmas holiday cards mistakenly delivered to my residence every year the only thing this company excels at is poor customer service and stuffing my mail box full of junk mail that ends up taking up space on my counter until trash day
8451260 your refund policy is complete bullshit from now on ill pay the little bit extra and ship everything ups
8451261 tests for perfect pitch have always demanded that subjects already have some musical training or at least familiarity with a particular piece of music which really limits the pool of candidates you can test
8451262 that means nobody really knew how prevalent perfect pitch is in humans in general
8451263 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
8451264 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
8451265 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
8451266 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
8451267 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable
8451268 although we may sometimes be ashamed to admit it the slave trade is an integral part of british history
8451269 it is inextricably linked to trade colonisation industrialisation and the british empire
8451270 it is important that children learn about this and the links to wider world history such as the american civil rights movement the repercussions of which are still being felt today
8451271 that is why the slave trade will join the british empire two world wars and the holocaust as compulsory parts of the secondary school history curriculum from this september
8451272 theres a lot of mis education about slavery and it hasnt really been taught in schools at all
8451273 its quite interesting in terms of todays history and what students need to know about the past to understand the present
8451274 you cant really talk about the history of the british empire without discussing this part of history
8451275 its that they may not consciously recognize the automatic associations that influence their decisions
8451276 the difference in reaction time was typically very small usually about 100 to 200 milliseconds
8451277 but these millisecond differences were informative enough for us to predict their future decisions
8451278 the lore in politics is that campaigns need to target undecided voters
8451279 but this research suggests that it may be much more effective to focus on your base by registering as many people as you can and getting them to vote on election day
8451280 roommate relationships can be really good or they can be really bad and the fear is that theyll go from bad to worse
8451281 but our study shows that you can create a supportive relationship and turn the stranger whos your roommate into a friend
8451282 basically people who give support in response to another persons needs and out of concern for another persons welfare are most successful at building close relationships that they find supportive
8451283 the transition from high school to college is challenging for a variety of reasons
8451284 the academic environment is usually more difficult and more competitive and moving away from the nuclear family for the first time disrupts established social support networks
8451285 so these findings provide some good news students can be the architects of their roommate relationships enhancing or undermining the quality of these important relationships
8451286 this is the first time that a study provides evidence that in the human brain dopamine is involved in the adaptations that result from sleep deprivation
8451287 these findings suggest dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain
8451288 the extent to which this occurs may differentiate how vulnerable people are to the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss
8451289 however the concurrent decline in cognitive performance which is associated with the dopamine increases suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it
8451290 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
8451291 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
8451292 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother
8451293 these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
8451294 a developing fetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning
8451295 but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems
8451296 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
8451297 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
8451298 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
8451299 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
8451300 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
8451301 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
8451302 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
8451303 when you think that you are referring to your intuition actually you just learn an association between subliminal signals in your context and the outcome of your actions
8451304 we just told the subjects to follow their intuition or gut feeling
8451305 if you are conscious you win much more money but you can still win money if you cannot consciously perceive the cues
8451306 this might now provide an explanation why we often base our decisions on intuitive hunches where a certain option somehow feels right
8451307 but we shouldnt be worried that we could be influenced against our will by such unconscious processes the study shows that the unconscious brain is intelligent enough to select the best options
8451308 today i am a free man i am longer a slave i am among men who are the same colour as me who consider me as a man i earn 1 000 cfa 2 1 a day and that covers my needs
8451309 i decided i would have to go and get him so i hatched a plan i told my master that i needed to take ahmed to his grandparents
8451310 i said we would both return the next day but we never went back
8451311 the situation has not changed with the arrival of democracy
8451312 for example i have an encampment and many people have come to live with us seeking refuge from war and famine
8451313 they help us with rearing the animals and general work
8451314 but this is not slavery like you would find in the koran
8451315 the bella people are free to leave their masters if they wish
8451316 if people came out to declare openly that they are slaves then of course the state would do something
8451317 slavery is taboo no one wants to talk about it
8451318 particularly at the level of the authorities they will not accept that it persists
8451319 like his parents before him iddar was born a slave a status ascribed to him at birth and grew up under the total control of a master who exacted labour from him for no remuneration
8451320 in my view iddars case is a clear case of slavery
8451321 the difficulty of constructing a case for iddar demonstrates the need for a law criminalising slavery in mali
8451322 while many americans are living paycheck to paycheck to effectively protect ourselves for the future we need to start saving paycheck to paycheck
8451323 our study shows that americans are better at saving money when they are thinking about it month to month on an ongoing basis rather than a long term goal
8451324 we plan on pay raises work bonuses and other monies to come forward but we cannot be thinking this way we need to start saving money every day
8451325 planning too far in advance not only makes consumers over optimistic regarding how much they will save but it also makes them behave in more aggressive and risk seeking ways in other financial arenas
8451326 the easiest thing to do is to be a smarter consumer and make spending and saving decisions thoughtfully on a daily basis that extra cup of coffee every morning carpooling with a co worker and cutting out the extras
8451327 the harder and more prudent thing to do is to mindfully take a portion of your earnings each pay period and save it in the bank
8451328 americans cant solely depend on their retirement plan it will be painful but like that mortgage or car loan payment we need to start thinking about a savings transfer every pay period
8451329 the effects of time frames on personal savings estimates savings behavior and financial decision making
8451330 we were really worried what the change of location would mean but now that were down here and were up and running people are finding us and its a great location were having a good time sales are real strong
8451331 if you ask the average fairgoer theyre very excited about some of the changes weve made the street entertainment is fantastic we did some new things and i think its had a positive impact on the fair
8451332 were going to bid it out next year but i can tell you weve broken records for box office receipts broken records for tickets sold and tickets issued
8451333 its been kind of slow for us just more people walking by on the other side not on this side thats the side they use to go back and forth to the concert
8451334 business is up a little bit but it all comes down to the type of concerts that are out there the rock concerts we end up doing better business than other ones
8451335 they said sure well come pick it up and well sell it for you and youll receive 70 percent of the full price
8451336 it was a very reputable company theyve been around forever and so we didnt think twice about it
8451337 youre going to have a baby today well be scheduling the surgery within the hour
8451338 shes on a high right now but her life goes in circles its like a roller coaster ride shes a person who is highly sensitive and just one little thing could set her off
8451339 at 15 she had a huge breakdown and had to return home to louisiana she was very insecure and felt like she wasnt pretty
8451340 theres no doubt based on the last two years that she is a highly unstable person shes on a temporary high right now but shes never really dealt with all the problems she had i dont think its possible to turn over a new leaf just like that

8451343 in this election we need a nominee who can pass the commander in chief test senator mccain will bring a time of experience to the campaign i will bring a lifetime of experience and senator obama will bring a speech he gave in 2002 i think that is a significant difference
8451344 down the road we will be looking at what may be required to rebuild the georgian military
8451345 right now the mission of the united states military is to provide humanitarian assistance
8451346 the danger is letting the russians think they can get away with this and do it again in ukraine or someplace else they have to realize that theyre not going to get a free ride
8451347 its physically impossible for us to do enough to deter the russians from further incursions so its not clear to me that military aid would be appreciably more than symbolic
8451348 its hard to imagine that the united states would embark on the process of rearming georgia until the conflict has reached a stable equilibrium that at least has the possibility of triggering some kind of military confrontation between the u s and russia
8451349 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8451350 during the coming issues youll learn how to get other people to do things like
8451351 any doubts about why russia invaded georgia have now been erased
8451352 by illegally recognizing the georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia dmitry medvedev russias president made clear that moscows goal is to redraw the map of europe using force this war was never about south ossetia or georgia
8451353 moscow is using its invasion prepared over years to rebuild its empire seize greater control of europes energy supplies and punish those who believed democracy could flourish on its borders
8451354 moscow has flipped the kosovo precedent on its head where the west acted to prevent ethnic cleansing in georgia ethnic cleansing is being used by russia to consolidate its military annexation
8451355 the next step in russias invasion script of disinformation and annexation is regime change if moscow can oust georgias democratically elected government it can then intimidate other democratic european governments where will this end
8451356 the message is clear russia will do as it pleases
8451357 if moscow is trying to overthrow our government using its lethal tools let us resist with democratic tools that have sustained more than 60 years of euro atlantic peace backing georgia with europes political and financial institutions is a powerful response
8451358 it doesnt appear that any of them knew they were going to iraq
8451359 a few were told they were going to work at an american camp they thought they were going to work in america
8451360 the safety and security of all employees and those the company serves remains kbrs top priority the company in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behavior
8451361 first sergeant hatley then made the call to take the detainees to a canal and kill them
8451362 so the patrol went to the canal and first sergeant sgt first class mayo and i took the detainees out of the back of the bradley fighting vehicle lined them up and shot them
8451363 then we pushed the bodies into the canal and left
8451364 i think the convention has gone pretty well so far what do you think
8451365 my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8451366 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8451367 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8451368 reminded us of what its like when you actually put people first
8451369 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8451370 china which has own separatists will be the biggest problem
8451371 the recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia is unacceptable for beijing
8451372 were not going to twist anyones hands to make them support recognition
8451373 i dont think there can ever be a season like last year
8451374 the buckeyes no 1 in the country no 2 in the pacific 10 conference no 3 in the southeastern conference east
8451375 what was good for our country was good for general motors and vice versa
8451376 the detroit manufacturers have been dissecting their involvement in nascar with a fervor not seen since well ever
8451377 were in a very early stage of evaluating all of our marketing initiatives and i just cant elaborate
8451378 where we dont see a direct return we arent going to do
8451379 the nascar community is a large part of their customer base theyre not going to leave this market because they sell so many vehicles and they get so much support from race fans
8451380 i figured theres no way that the security guards are just going to assault this random dude in front of a cop
8451381 it landed within five feet of me i leaned down to pick it up and i got tackled by two of the dudes they threw me into that ivy covered wall and i was trying to get them off me at one point there were three guards on me i threw the tape to sean and thats when it got really ugly
8451382 he hurled him into it then threw him onto the ground at this point there are two or three officers there
8451383 they beat the shit out of him in front of a cop
8451384 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8451385 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8451386 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8451387 has been the face of the chargers defense the past three seasons he has 39 1 2 sacks in that span more than any other nfl player and has played in three straight pro bowls ladainian tomlinson knocked out of last seasons afc championship game after aggravating a
8451388 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8451389 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defense
8451390 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8451391 were happy with the verdict but its a shame this should have been limited to one death
8451392 he should have had the courage and the guts to kill himself before killing anyone else
8451393 nicole likes brownies and not the kind you eat but theyre edible to her
8451394 nicoles not allowed in the hot tub with other people
8451395 the power of precedent when analyzed is like the power of the beaten path
8451396 ill appeal all the way to the us supreme court
8451397 i thought my boyfriend loved me but he really was just horny
8451398 this is john brumbys fallback plan because of his failure to transfer freight to rail as labor promised
8451399 in december 2007 roads minister pallas promised full consultation with local communities and councils about b triples
8451400 john brumby should tell minister pallas to pick up the phone and start making calls instead of traeating local communities and councils like mushrooms
8451401 the challenge weve got is the freight task in victoria is going to more than double by 2030 so theres going to be a lot more goods being moved and weve got to look at the most efficient way of moving them
8451402 with b triples if it means less trucks on the road and fewer trucks in local roads thatd be a good thing
8451403 but before we make any decision in relation to b triples we would consult very widely
8451404 there is now because weve revealed this this was the secret plan they were keeping from communities
8451405 this was the plan that was going to be buried in a transport plan in november no consultation with local communities no consultation with local police no consultation with local safety groups
8451406 let us stop the spiral of fear give peace and dialogue a chance
8451407 one can only take our republic away from us by killing us
8451408 shame on georgia and its supporters like the traitor sanakoyev
8451409 and despite meeting the cost down demands of its customers the company has decided to let 80 workers go mr dargavel said
8451410 we need better trade and industry policies to ensure that redundancies like these do not continue to occur
8451411 ten years ago pbr bosch employed over 1 200 workers it now employs half that that is a direct effect of the 10 years of neglect by the former government that saw 50 000 jobs lost from the manufacturing sector
8451412 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8451413 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8451414 barack obama is ready to honour the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8451415 president clinton is obviously committed to doing whatever he can and is asked to do to ensure senator obama is the next president of the united states
8451416 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8451417 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8451418 yall sit down we got to get along with the show here sit down please stop please sit
8451419 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8451420 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8451421 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8451422 now he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8451423 at the start of this campaign we had a very simple idea which is change in america doesnt start from the top down it starts from the bottom up
8451424 that change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things
8451425 and so we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8451426 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for president of the united states by acclamation
8451427 i have been asked to inform you that senator obama accepts the nomination
8451428 it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me of whether you voted for barack the time is now to reunite as a single party with a single purpose
8451429 none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together
8451430 hillary couldnt have said it better none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is our one shot so lets roll up our sleeves
8451431 seandainya allah membebani kita suatu amalan tanpa niat niscaya ini adalah pembebanan yang sulit dilakukan
8451432 tidaklah sah puasa seseorang kecuali dengan niat letak niat adalah dalam hati tidak disyaratkan untukdiucapkan dan pendapat ini tidak terdapat perselisihan di antara para ulama
8451433 barangsiapa yang tidak berniat sebelum fajar maka puasanya tidak sah
8451434 ini adalah dalil bagi mayoritas ulama bahwa boleh berniat di siang hari sebelum matahari bergeser ke barat pada puasa sunnah
8451435 dan makan minumlah hingga terang bagimu benag putih dari benang hitam yaitu fajar kemudian sempurnakanlah puasa itu sampai datang malam
8451436 makan dan minumlah janganlah kalian menjadi takut oleh pancaran sinar putih yang menjulang makan dan minumlah sehingga tampak bagi kalian warna merah
8451437 jika salah seorang diantara kalian mendengar adzan sedangkan suapan terakhir masih ada di tangannya maka janganlah dia meletakkan suapan tersebut hingga dia menuaikan hajatnya hingga selesai
8451438 small and medium enterprises in australia have more confidence in alan carpenter and morris iemma than they do in kevin rudds government
8451439 mr swan and mr rudd talked up inflation and talked down the economy and they have undermined confidence and theyve undermined prospects for jobs prospects for business and prosperity
8451440 most businesses are now saying that demand is the issue that the economy is the issue that the current economic conditions are really making their business pretty tough at the moment
8451441 the situation is reminiscent of the 1988 presidential campaign between george h
8451442 we are in the midst of the worst financial crisis since world war ii
8451443 how can i expect her to stay with me anymore
8451444 shes not going to want to be intimate with a freak elephant man thats the way i saw myself
8451445 combined with the fact that returning vets are usually older and partnered this is having a devastating effect on relationships
8451446 the man will say i dont even feel like having sex anymore he has been conditioned to not feel emotions and may experience hypervigilance or anxiety when touched emotional detachment is a hallmark of ptsd
8451447 the first time you see the reflection of your changed body whether sitting in a wheel chair or severely disfigured because of facial burns it is shocking people who are not married look down and ask will anyone ever be interested in me if they are married they wonder will my partner still find me sexually attractive facing issues of body image and sexual self esteem are pretty universal
8451448 i knew that i definitely wanted to have more children and i knew that he was not interested in me and so a big red flag to me was well what did i do why does he not want to have sex why does he not want to touch my hand or why is he not asking me to get in the bed am i the only one that is feeling like i want in the bed
8451449 he had dreams that he didnt realize he was having
8451450 he was much more active during these dreams nothing that would keep me up but yes there was a part of him he couldnt control
8451451 this war can result in separate bedrooms and sexless loveless marriages 25 years down the road
8451452 many couples are resilient and their relationships last or may even be strengthened
8451453 one woman sends her husband to the bunker in the basement
8451454 its inadvertently sending a message that he cant handle it
8451455 i was good looking before and im better looking now
8451456 declaremos juntos en una sola voz aqu mismo y en este momento que barack obama es nuestro candidato
8451457 lo que se intent es que hillary clinton saliera a interrumpir la votaci n antes que obama lograra los 2 025 delegados que necesitaba para ganar la nominaci n

8451514 they have their clothes theyre getting food regularly and they may even have access to satellite tv

8451525 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
8451526 i havent seen anything that comes close to the horrendous facts that were presented in this case
8451527 i feel like im in a really great place in my life and i love what im doing i love acting but i cant hire myself if this works then were in business if not i tried

8451532 i think the convention has gone pretty well so far what do you think
8451533 my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8451534 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8451535 i really believe there are things nobody would see if i didnt photograph them

8451540 the fur industry wants the public to believe that most of the mink liberated are recaptured or killed after being freed but this is not the case and i would argue that even if some are recaptured at least they have been given a chance at what everyone deserves a chance to live free
8451541 contrary to the rhetoric of those who profit from the imprisonment and killing of these beautiful wild creatures scientific studies have proven captive mink have the innate ability to survive in the wild do not decimate other animal populations or the environment and do not carry away small children or pets

8451550 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
8451551 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8451552 that campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8451553 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8451554 the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and restore u s leadership in the world
8451555 before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8451556 you dont decide who loves this country you dont decide who is a patriot
8451557 the grand old party is no longer grand its just old
8451558 i accept your nomination to run and serve with barack obama the next president of the united states of america

8451566 im sure with obamas for profit audio tapes of his policies he will also have an audio tape of his speech probably a dvd you can buy probably posters you can buy and whatever his money men think of 400 million and counting thats what hes campaign has collected how shameful while military families struggle children go hungry in america and homelessness runs rampant and we are supposed to vote for obama hardly
8451567 oh sim eu estou t o cansado mas n o pr dizer que n o acredito mais em voc eu n o preciso de muito dinheiro gra as a deus mas vou tomar aquele velho navio aquele velho navio
8451568 we decided to call it that in honor of americas black voters who have strongly supported barack obamas presidential run
8451569 oh and youll just love the design weve come up with its so fabulous the colors are to die for and the theme just makes me squirm with excitement i feel so squishy inside its enough to make even a dictator blush
8451570 its primarily due to its large size people expect big things from a black president
8451571 barack obama needs a temple to rule america from because hes not only the countrys first black president hes the western worlds first black deity
8451572 whatever they geoff petrie and the maloofs want to do is fine with me
8451573 i just havent heard anything about that for a while but i think they saw spencer getting better late in the season so maybe that had something to do with where were at
8451574 structure your quote so people have to read it 14 times to figure out you didnt say anything
8451575 whatever they geoff petrie and the maloofs want to do is fine with me
8451576 i just havent heard anything about that for a while
8451577 companies have to wake up to the fact that they are more than a product on a shelf theyre behavior as well
8451578 les cotisations dadh sion au parti socialiste sont r duites un niveau symbolique pour attirer de nouveaux militants
8451579 d clar e l lection de 2012 ayant dit cela on ne peut carter quune personne royal car elle a fait pas mal de d clarations claires sur le sujet dautres qui nont rien dit mais qui y pensent il y en a donc on serait hypocrite na f et injuste
8451580 pr sident de la iiie ou de la ive r publique
8451581 robert was really disappointed that he didnt merit a mention the award was for the bands performance so he thought he should have at least been thanked
8451582 it is my submission that that has not been proved certainly not to the criminal standard and that a doubt based on reason exists
8451583 jose hernandez theres evidence before this court to conclude has no accent he speaks like a canadian born young man because thats what he is
8451584 colours all of the rest of the evidence which the crown proffered in support of the theory that mr hernandez is the speaker overheard by mr mcmynn
8451585 this kind of evidence is neither sufficiently accurate nor reliable to support a conviction in my view
8451586 should i lose weight to do movies and tv dont i have to be skinny to be on tv
8451587 thanks jen it was a fun column for me im glad you enjoyed ittoo being comfortable in your skin is really all that matters whenit comes down to it right keep rockin
8451588 to building firms we were just a bunch of hippies
8451589 but we were the first in the country to go to commercial building sites the trick is to win over the foreman
8451590 we would like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
8451591 it can be difficult to persuade people of the moral argument behind recycling but when a business realises that it will affect them financially they are likely to respond
8451592 legislation is getting tighter if they want to prepare their business for the future they should get arrangements in place for recycling as soon as possible
8451593 a waste volume is agreed before we sign the contract
8451594 if the trade contractor goes over that they pay for the waste the key is to prevent waste from coming to site in the first place by reducing packaging and working with trade contractors segregation and waste management should be the last link in the chain
8451595 what you mean theyre all illegal we never would have hired them if we had known that
8451596 i thought i served well and really moved good for the first round i went on a good roll at one point there
8451597 this takes a little bit of pressure off me because i know a little more about where my game is at
8451598 hay muchos que mantienen mucha ganas de tenerme preso aqu o destituido o preso en la corte penal internacional les va dar mucha lidia porque aqu hemos procedido con toda la honradez con el m s riguroso ce imiento a la constituci n colombiana
8451599 una investigaci n formal practicada por la corte penal internacional a nuestras autoridades por la obstrucci n a las acciones de nuestra justicia por delitos de lesa humanidad
8451600 debe decir con claridad si entreg o no dineros a campa as pol ticas para las elecciones de 1991
8451601 mientras la oposici n no la dejan acercar a las puertas de la casa de nari o los delincuentes entran tranquilamente por el s tano de palacio
8451602 los calumniosos se alamientos que el se or presidente hizo en contra del senador juan fernando cristo y entiende esta actitud como un intento de callar un partido y una bancada de congresistas que por los caminos democr ticos est en la oposici n
8451603 no puede eludir ol mpicamente su responsabilidad pol tica en el manejo de la direcci n seccional de fiscal as de medell n con el d bil argumento de que la responsabilidad penal de su hermano es personal esa fiscal a infiltrada por la mafia seg n el presidente uribe es la misma que manej su hermano y cuota pol tica guillermo le n valencia
8451604 es lamentable tener un presidente tan poco reflexivo tan poco calmado qu pena que se defienda con su rabia y no con su inteligencia
8451605 explicar el ingreso a la casa de nari o tan f cil y tan frecuentemente de reconocidos delincuentes del paramilitarismo con el fin de realizar maniobras contra la corte suprema de justicia
8451606 por qu deslegitima de manera tan burda y reiterada las decisiones de la corte suprema de justicia en relaci n con las investigaciones que ella realiza en contra de los pol ticos aliados del paramilitarismo
8451607 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8451608 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8451609 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8451610 we are the veterans the iraq war veterans the anti war veterans
8451611 i just cant imagine driving through my neighborhood at home and seeing a security checkpoint
8451612 youre going to die unless you travel back in time and replace us
8451613 well i pay my rent in cash so ive already set that aside for monday thats right its a good thing im not going to spend the money i need to live on something that will prevent me from dying
8451614 you should plant trees only in months that include an r
8451615 if you disturb a trees roots when its growing real fast itll freak out wondering what happened to its comfy dirt home and it probably wont do very well for you
8451616 i need to think about this for at least a couple of hours to make certain its what i want
8451617 bobo and i were having lunch the other day and laughing at the your wonderful blog and replies to celebrity encounters i was recognized at the air port a first for me
8451618 mars aint the kind of place to raise a child
8451619 bars aint the kind of place to raise a child
8451620 are you sure you wanna be with me ive nothing to give
8451621 we dont have to travel as far we had games as far as steubenville ohio which is like a 7 hour trip and wayne we had a difficult schedule but we have a competitive schedule this year also
8451622 weve got to be more aggressive and we know that we have to get out there and work hard we feel like in the off season that it was a big part to get out there and have a great program which i feel we were pretty successful at that
8451623 hes a 4 year starter at offensive tackle and defensive tackle were looking to get leadership out of him this year hes big strong and physical so thats a strong point on our football team is our offensive line we have 5 returning starters back from last year so were hoping we can build from there
8451624 i do have two questions for catherynne m valente question 1 what inspired you if anything to write this particular story i read arabian nights for the first time since i was a child in the summer of 2002 it was a relatively new translation hussein haddawys rather than the typical burton collection of whitewashing additions and bowdlerizations i was fascinated by the structure how each tale broke from the previous one to give the sense of a whole though arabian nights has given us many individual tales i had just graduated from college with a degree in classical linguistics i thought entirely useless and had a bunch of mythology banging around in my head i was daydreaming on my couch in the sweltering air conditioningless rhode island summer and i thought i wonder if i could put together everything i know about mythology and folklore and language and storytelling and make a completely new myth cycle hot on the heels of that my brain piped up what if all the stories in arabian nights were really just one big story not individual ones at all brains do things like that to you sometimes dastardly things so i decided id try to write a few stories like that and give them to my niece for christmas id laminate them so she could get jam and mud all over it i wrote her a story about a prince and a goose and the thing is the story just kept opening up in my head like an origami box it just grew and grew and i suppose in some sense i grew up with it i was barely 23 when i began it and 29 when the last book was published i lived all over the world while i worked on it rhode island scotland california japan virginia and finally ohio everything i loved and learned went into it my niece never got her laminated pages but the book is dedicated to her question 2 did you write each individual story then piece them together or did you write or plan them already intertwined
8451625 actually ms valentes website has such a comprehensive faq im almost at a loss to come up with anything new but i will venture a couple first i see youve travelled to japan have you travelled extensively elsewhere and what countries places would you like to visit if you had the time and means secondly if you had the chance to travel to ancient alexandria and visit the library whose works would you seek out and why thank you very much for your time and participation here and more thanks for producing such an enchanted novel
8451626 this wasnt your typical fantasy novel and i mean that in a very good way so i was wondering what kind of works influenced you in your writing and what can you tell us about the second book in the series how did the orphans tales differ from your previously published works
8451627 1 you had dozens of story threads that you had to keep track of and tie up at the end how did you keep them all straight flow charts venn diagrams i kept seeing that scene from a beautiful mind where the room was filled with highlighted newspapers connected by red string
8451628 i was entranced by your book how did you come up with the idea to write a book of interrelating stories did you have to do much research to come up with all the different characters and mythologies
8451629 was there a reason the boy prince and the girl with the birthmark eyes had no names in the story
8451630 indeed the writing style began to positively irk me which made it increasingly difficult to stay in the story
8451631 i spent most of the book thinking the narrator was going to be the killer and was a bit disappointed when he wasnt
8451632 i found it really weird that sadie would hang out with the narrator of the story it really bugged me i was fine with her hanging out with ryan though
8451633 what is with all the binders on the shelf in the writers room do each of them hold a script of a previous episode
8451634 whos desk is the neatest and whos is the worst
8451635 in your personal opinion do you think that with a large fan outcry atlantis could be saved
8451636 have you guys seen a large influx of protesters out side your doors and the studio since the announcement
8451637 what is the mood in the office and studio since most of the writers and producers are going to be out of a job
8451638 how is the atmosphere on stage considering the actors are now with out there jobs is it a sad place to be now that they know the news are emotions running wild
8451639 i was wondering if the last episode shot finishes filming at the end of september how many more weeks of post production will you have until the final episode sadly is completed and you can finally relax
8451640 if the first movies a success how long do you think future movies would keep being produced for
8451641 why is your calender set to october two months before october
8451642 is a new sg1 movie script in the writing stage at this point
8451643 how does it make you feel knowing that i roll out of bed and check your blog first thing before i even eat or say morning to mr das or feed the cats
8451644 btw do you wear high heels or were your secretary following you around the production shoot
8451645 when rodney is telling keller about his mother and he makes the comment that he doesnt understand her ive taken it to mean that either he was very very little when she died or else she was speaking to him in another language french
8451646 for the record joe i dont think that you knew and even if if you knew then how could we be angry at you keeping it a secret its call confidentiality
8451647 from what source do you get the questions to which you respond in your blog at this site is it from comments submitted here or elsewhere and or other sites like gateworld
8451648 also will any or some group of the writers producers directors be attending the april 2009 convention in vancouver
8451649 to keep the flames burning in these dark times would you tell your avid fans a basic plot summary for the episode that could have been hexed
8451650 is a new sg1 movie script in the writing stage at this point
8451651 crap i need to get out of here before he has me do more crazy things
8451652 not much talk has been issued about teyla in any episode after the queen can we expect to see her in episodes after or do many teyla fans have some hearbreak in store for them
8451653 okay so youre not going to be able to be a part of stargate anymore but you can have your pick of any show still running or not to play a vital role in the show must be pre existing
8451654 now whenever i need to fact check all i have to do is stroll in step all over his couch and consult the appropriate script
8451655 jason m is single handedly ensuring that the mood on set remains upbeat
8451656 by the way where was the camera during this you couldnt have been looking through it because that means youre only about as tall as carls chest right or is he really just that gigantic
8451657 with a lineup of experienced racers and the satria r3 machine i am confident our dream of a podium finish will happpen
8451658 guns n roses representatives have been made aware of the arrests and are leaving the matter to the authorities
8451659 i love it i think its the best time ive ever had on the road actually the best time ive ever had writing a record as well i think after all these years i finally got to the point where i realize that this is what i want to be doing
8451660 i felt good today i feel at ease without having to rush around here and there it was a hectic period
8451661 i thought i would win the by election i never thought anwar would enjoy such a big majority but it does not mean they have rejected me i think the voters were swayed by anwars ceramah and propaganda
8451662 the fact that i was selected to contest by the party leadership itself is an honour and i am proud of the trust the party has in me
8451663 i will continue to work for the people of permatang pauh and seberang jaya
8451664 when am i going to make money instead of spending it
8451665 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8451666 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8451667 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8451668 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8451669 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8451670 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
8451671 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
8451672 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
8451673 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
8451674 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8451675 hallo doe mij maar een piza calzone en een fles rode wijn
8451676 our thefts were up substantially in july for motorcycle theft so this may explain part of it
8451677 and just as an example we found 28 batteries we believe that would directly coincide with 28 motorcycles
8451678 no matter where we stand at the end of the melt season its just reinforcing this notion that arctic ice is in its death spiral
8451679 primarily reflects melt in the chukchi sea off the alaskan coast and the east siberian seas off the coast of eastern russia
8451680 unfortunately its what we might expect to see if bears are forced to swim longer distances
8451681 the arctic is gigantic when you have nine bears sighted in one transect route one can assume that there are likely a lot more bears swimming in open water
8451682 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8451683 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8451684 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest
8451685 furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet
8451686 the work does certainly indicate that the ice sheet is sensitive to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
8451687 the answer is most likely related to the fact that underneath the ice on greenland are some high altitude mountains on the east coast which are high enough to be cold enough that ice can form which then flows slowly down the slopes and eventually covers the entire island
8451688 in certain time periods for example about 20 000 years ago when the earths orbit is aligned in a certain way ice does start to form in canada and siberia for example in the last ice age
8451689 that is the million dollar question which researchers will no doubt be trying to answer during the next few years
8451690 its essential for victims of homophobic hate crime to understand that criminal justice agencies are there to help them
8451691 at times i think were seen as an easy target who can be picked on i suppose the presumption is that nobody will stick up for us and that were fair game
8451692 to begin with i didnt go to the police about some of these things it didnt occur to me there was any law against the name calling i didnt think i would get a sympathetic hearing from the police
8451693 a lot of my friends who are lesbian and gay told me of negative experiences that theyve had when they tried reporting crime there tends to be this negative idea in the community and it puts people off
8451694 the same boys came and did mooning then again they were throwing stones
8451695 they put some handfuls of potential flammable rubbish through the letterbox the local secondary school was burnt to the ground not very far from where we were living and it made me very frightened at that time that we might be at risk of an arson attack
8451696 it was at that point that i involved the hate crime officers from that point on i felt as if the service we were receiving from the police improved enormously
8451697 the fire service came and assess the fire safety of the house and the police started to take us more seriously really and to pursue the culprits more effectively
8451698 currently there is something like us 25 billion available for developing countries
8451699 the estimated need in 2030 would be about us 130 billion a year so there is still a gap of us 105 billion
8451700 most money is going to the large developing countries china india and brazil
8451701 but there is a danger that the un process will be sidelined by hard cash
8451702 africa has a voice in the un system africa does not have a voice in the market
8451703 in africa the type of projects that need to be funded is access to water agriculture so you can produce food with less water
8451704 une pratique consistant jouer le r le de ses personnages h ros de mangas danimation japonaise de tokusatsu de films ou de jeux vid o voire de ses artistes de musique favoris notamment en imitant leur costume et leur maquillage
8451705 o j hit the cupboard hard and the glass shattered all over him he fell to the floor bleeding
8451706 i noticed you like sisterhood of the traveling pants i like those books as well i just saw the second movie
8451707 yeah my mom says theyre good for me at this adolescent stage of my development
8451708 if this all works out what am i supposed to do quit my job and sell my house and move three hours away from my friends and family
8451709 holy crap anyone that makes me actually enjoy a trip to the dump is a keeper
8451710 that just sounds dumb and pompous to me so when i do say it i say it with a low
8451711 come all you who are thirsty come to the waters and you who have no money come buy and eat come buy wine and milk without money and without cost
8451712 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8451713 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound
8451714 its going to accelerate climate change through changes in the reflectance of the arctic
8451715 its going from bright ice to a much darker ocean
8451716 that allows for the breakdown of that by bacteria and other organisms that release co2 or methane depending on how the breakdown occurs
8451717 i just wish i could be able to tell from a guys online profile whether or not well have chemistry there must be a simple way to be able to read a profile and know if were going to
8451718 i just wish i could be able to tell from a guys online profile whether or not well have chemistry there must be a simple way to be able to read a profile and know if were going to
8451719 i think he not only got the malay votes but also received an extra boost from the non malays with the help of gerakan members
8451720 this may mean that the non malay bn component parties can no longer pull in votes
8451721 even if sapp sabah progressive party defects they pakatan rakyat would only have two more parliamentary seats and that isnt enough to form a new government
8451722 i dont think you will see a huge upset in sabah
8451723 despite the majority his win is confined to the local situation in permatang pauh
8451724 to me it will not trigger any crossover to the opposition especially among the sabah bn mps who are steadfast in their struggles with the coalition
8451725 his dream to form the federal government on sept 16 will remain just a dream
8451726 we also hope that the other component parties will relook the issue of power sharing and the rebranding of bn and ensure that it is adhered to
8451727 his increased majority will not by itself be enough to entice sabah mps to jump ship
8451728 this is because his win has not changed the equation between the number of bn mps and the number of opposition mps in parliament
8451729 snake in my ass literally right now theres a snake in my ass
8451730 would you sleep with your friends grandma if she had the face of an 80 year old woman but the body of a supermodel
8451731 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
8451732 compared to what we know now x is trivial and uninteresting
8451733 indonesia and vietnam are definitely tough opponents but they are not unbeatable we will stay focused and try to make the semi finals
8451734 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8451735 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8451736 the combination of obamas liberal record his middle name hussein and his blackness those three things are enough to put an elderly southern conservative into a state of shock
8451737 i was hoping that most of the turmoil in this community was behind us but it was just starting it was like a cancer in the whole community it wouldnt go away no matter how much people wanted it to
8451738 who need to be brought before the bar of justice
8451739 theres still a racial edge people still see things in black and white its deeply ingrained the mindset is whites vote republican blacks democrat
8451740 if a black man stood for president you would just say no way no way
8451741 the generation that wouldnt contemplate a black president is passing on and thats good for everybody if its not now its just around the corner we will no longer be denied
8451742 its a feeling you cant put into words its like we are no longer a subculture finally its given us reason to think we are part of the overall scheme of things
8451743 any democratic candidate who gets a big turnout of black voters is off to a very good start its just getting that other 20 thats difficult
8451744 i honestly thought this would be different i mean were not in the 60s any more but it really became a big issue for me
8451745 i asked her was there a problem with the fact that he was black she told me i had to get out
8451746 you dont want a president with no connection to christianity
8451747 when you drive through white neighbourhoods i dont think youll see many obama signs or bumper stickers people who vote for him will do it quietly they dont know who he is what his religion is is he the antichrist
8451748 id like reassurance about who he is whos backing him just to be sure theres not an underlying current
8451749 that he does turn out to be a muslim after all
8451750 i dont have anything against a black man as president
8451751 but obama hes not qualified when you are president you represent everyone not just your race ive heard him talk about his people
8451752 and what about his religion he cant just drop his religion
8451753 well he should make it clear he stands by christian values in america that he doesnt hold those other values
8451754 i dont think hes done that at all hes just run from it he should have nipped it in the bud and made clear hes a president for everybody
8451755 just because hes a muslim he should make it clear he doesnt believe in suicide bombing and killing
8451756 theyre going to try and make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
8451757 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
8451758 roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
8451759 call me crazy but isnt it possible just possible that obamas lead is being inhibited by the fact that he is you know black
8451760 the northern system of segregation has never been about symbols of power on the streets separate water fountains but about segregated neighbourhoods and workplaces
8451761 states like ohio are so close that just a couple of percent of voters who decide not to vote for him on grounds of race could swing the result
8451762 not just because hes black though thats a very good start but because he has no experience
8451763 if blacks come in here we really dont have anything available for them
8451764 some people wonder what im doing here let alone a black president of the united states
8451765 a black president thats a tough sell obama could be all right now but come november people might say not yet
8451766 theres a lot of people who dont want a black man in the white house
8451767 it would say that we as a country have arrived theres a need for redemption there always will be an obama presidency will provide some of that redemption
8451768 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8451769 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8451770 we need to trace this call keep him on the line for as long as you can oh darn he hung up right before we got the trace

8451772 abortion just might not be wrong if the womans not too far along
8451773 if quiapo were in melbourne the rich and famous would be scrambling to live in it
8451774 union bosses are working overtime and spending tens of millions of dollars to get card check passed were going to work equally hard to educate people about the threat to private ballots in union organizing elections
8451775 the ability for workers to cast their vote in private is at stake
8451776 they just took her in a really odd direction that i didnt necessarily agree with at the time

8451781 ensure that every child everywhere is taught to build and not to destroy
8451782 lead the world in battling immediate evils and promoting the ultimate good
8451783 choose its own tomorrow free from the shadows of yesterday
8451784 look at berlin where a wall came down a continent came together and history proved there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
8451785 there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists let them come to berlin
8451786 the walls between races and tribes natives and immigrants christian and muslim and jew cannot stand these now are the walls we must tear down
8451787 time for a president who leads who serves our troops as they serve us
8451788 he is the best most qualified to serve as commander in chief
8451789 the equipment training and resources to address their needs to fully complete their mission
8451790 courage to serve the gift to lead and the ability to get things done
8451791 on a horrific and watery path and endure myriad challenges before they could rest in the afterlife
8451792 i have to tell you you are a very kind person i have had an awful day and i had to get up those chemicals before i picked up my daughter thank you
8451793 shouldnt this sprain be healing by now because wow does it hurt
8451794 decide travel is a priority then start saving to make it happen
8451795 no one particularly enjoys making sacrifices but it helps if you can visualize the payoff realize that by cooking dinner at home instead of going out to eat youve saved enough money for a nights stay at a guest house on lake titicaca by skipping that second or third beer at the ballgame youve paid for a couple of banana leaf thali dinners in southern india and when you refuse to buy another unnecessary pair of shoes you have covered the cost of an overnight ferry to one of the greek islands
8451796 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8451797 we have not found willing partners on the other side of the table
8451798 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8451799 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8451800 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8451801 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8451802 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8451803 i dont know how i can live now because none of my family is left
8451804 we believe that the justice system will prevail and that our client will be found innocent
8451805 this case has no weight its a web of lies
8451806 concrete results in the reforms promised would restore the peoples confidence and respect for institutions such as the judiciary the executive the civil service and police
8451807 the government must also find ways to enhance the opportunities for the people to increase their income as well as help reduce the cost of living and doing business
8451808 while the by election result shows the preference of the permatang pauh voters it may well be reflective of the overall perception and feelings of malaysians elsewhere
8451809 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8451810 i havent seen anything that comes close to the horrendous facts that were presented in this case
8451811 i personally honour loyalty this is best thrashed out in the bn supreme council it is best to remain in bn i dont think this call to leave bn is the majority view
8451812 this racial politics is the reason why the party lost so badly our association with umno turned off many of our voters
8451813 they can blame umno all they want for their losses but they are realising it is the present leaders themselves who are condoning this situation
8451814 they allowed politics in bn to come to this stage and gerakan members just dont buy into the argument any more that they are the conscience of the alliance
8451815 they did it before in 1969 being an opposition party but without being in any coalition with any other opposition parties
8451816 i have received several inquiries via sms from a few of them
8451817 there is a vast difference in ideology between bn and the opposition and the pas led state government is not performing up to mark theres no way anyone of us would cross over
8451818 what this country can accomplish when a democrat is in the white house a wonderful thing
8451819 president clinton presided over the longest economic expansion in american history
8451820 that meant more than 22 million new jobs higher incomes at every income level the lowest unemployment rate in 40 years the lowest poverty rate in 20 years the lowest crime rate in 26 years the smallest welfare rolls in 32 years and the highest homeownership in history
8451821 and lets remember he did all this while inheriting a record deficit from the previous president and leaving a record surplus for the president weve got today
8451822 meek said he left a legacy of national strength and common national purpose on which president barack obama is going to build
8451823 i give you one of the greatest presidents in the history of our country william jefferson clinton
8451824 the phoenix womens commission uses its leadership skills and expertise to focus on the special challenges that face women

8451827 have you not heard of the parole evidence rule up in the piney woods
8451828 when you can forcefully route someones traffic through you before it reaches it targeted destination thats really bad
8451829 looking at these vuln announcements 2008 will be known as the year where we could have taken down the internet
8451830 if you abuse your abilities youre going to lose your abilities
8451831 the bgp community is small enough and logged enough that those elements that are doing consistently nasty stuff will be dealt with
8451832 theres not going to be a metaspoit module that any kid can run that can go ahead and run this attack
8451833 this is a section not merely confined to gay rights it acts as an effective deterrent against paedophiles and those with sick minds
8451834 tampering with the well laid out provisions of the ipc could unsettle the legal framework in the country
8451835 section 377 which criminalises men who have sex with men must go in order to remove structural discrimination against those vulnerable to hiv
8451836 removal of section 377 will open floodgates of delinquent behaviour

8451882 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8451883 i think the convention has gone pretty well so far what do you think
8451884 my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8451885 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8451886 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8451887 reminded us of what its like when you actually put people first
8451888 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8451889 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8451890 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8451891 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8451892 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8451893 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8451894 use adsense to fill unsold inventory or compete on price against other ad networks
8451895 i think based on the way you guys are playing the songs the actual tracking of the songs is gonna happen very quickly
8451896 its gonna be on and its gonna be on fire everyones gonna be looking at each other and i think its gonna be amazing its not gonna be a boring laborious its gonna be all worked out were gonna know what it is you can practice as much as you want and its gonna be on fire its gonna be great and itll sound like it its not gonna sound put together itll sound like this explosion of energy of people staring at each other and really feeding off each others vibe thats what its gonna be
8451897 why do you people waste your time reading all these storys watching the videos and listening to the teasers if you hate metallica
8451898 anything they do is shit just because it is metallica doing it
8451899 its tour going to be very draining and she needs him around to aid her in her recovery time after each show

8451901 chris and i were very good friends and when he died it just shattered me i was completely f ked up for a long time i couldnt believe he was dead
8451902 he was such a strong wonderful guy we had a lot of fun together over the years i just miss him very much and thought it would be nice to dedicate the film to him so thats why i did it
8451903 i wanted his mother eileen to play my mother in the film but the casting people in vancouver made sure that didnt happen i see her around malibu and go and visit her once in awhile shes a lovely lady
8451904 its called vacanze di natale which means christmas vacation its not in english so they dubbed my lines into italian
8451905 it was great i didnt have to like talk to anybody on the set i was just in my own little world and i had a great time by myself
8451906 our marriage is great i dont know how i got lucky we are working on kids
8451907 the consideration that we are definitely staying in the uk is not as strong as it used to be
8451908 we will be looking at the situation closely and may be able to say more towards the end of this year
8451909 its just a waiting game right now whatever we do in the future is gonna have to be fresh
8451910 i have to see if the band as a whole wants to go into the recording studio for a new record that makes sense on some level for us theres gotta be an angle it cant be just playing our old songs over and over
8451911 i didnt read it nor would i my friends called me and said oh she said this and this tori and i were friends but along the way people grow in different directions i did my thing she did her thing and that was pretty much it
8451912 ive been approached so many times but i look at writing books as something you do in your 80s when you have no more chapters left in life
8451913 my book would be boring because i would never write about my castmates whether i liked them or not when youre working on a set thats a sacred and private experience its not supposed to end up in a book for somebody to make money off of
8451914 if you experiment with drugs eventually something good can come out but im not sure that drugs were good for me
8451915 marijuana made me very paranoid about living up to my reputation but it also helped me concentrate on my music it gave me insight into writing songs that i didnt have before so it wasnt all bad
8451916 it gave me a case of the scareds i mostly got over it but when you take a drug like lsd youre never going to be the same again
8451917 come on up for the rising come on up for the rising tonight

8451923 only a few hundred babies have been born across the globe using this technique this is the first time in india that this method has been used
8451924 just like sperms oocytes can be stored for later use
8451925 but over time it will feel the economic and political losses if she truly wants respect and influence and the benefits which flow from it then russia needs to change course
8451926 russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago
8451927 the sight of russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain

8451966 the idea that the cosmos itself undergoes an immense indeed an infinite number of deaths and rebirths it is only in the vedas in which the time scales correspond to those of modern scientific cosmology age is billions of years a millennium before europeans were willing to divest themselves of the biblical idea that the world was a few thousand years old the mayans were thinking of millions and the indians billions
8451967 when i read the bhagavad gita and reflect about how god created this universe everything else seems so superfluous
8451968 the sacred books the vedas claim truth is one but sages call it by different names if only all the rest of the monotheistic book religions had learned that lesson all the horror of historys religious wars could have been avoided which

8451972 a man whipped himself until he bled during a shia muslim religious ceremony before allegedly forcing two boys to do the same a court has heard
8451973 this devout man used considerable force upon himself clearly causing injuries and causing others present to fear for his safety to such an extent that they started to intervene and calm him down
8451974 the prosecution say the defendant ignored the advice given to him that this practice was not allowed for children under 16 years of age
8451975 this was not only against their own will but in any event is not allowed by law

8451977 as a direct selling company we live and breath by the number of sellers we have people are looking for different ways to earn and we offer them a good way of earning extra pocket money

8451980 we will have to find out who is the spokesman for the three
8451981 then we can discuss how to take forward the issue of succession shareholders would be nervous if sir tom was looking for his own replacement
8451982 these changes are very welcome and demonstrate that the rbs board is getting to grips with its governance
8451983 these non executives need to introduce us to the larger management team like in the old days

8451988 we need to make progress with that transaction as quickly as we possibly can hmg is a minority shareholder
8451989 its for the majority of shareholders to come to a view about how they want the future of that company to be addressed we are clear that the edf deal is a good one it will allow us to fast track nuclear development
8451990 i really want to move on i dont think we can go on very much longer without knowing how things are going to unfold i would like this all to possibly be resolved within the next couple of weeks
8451991 im not sure how feasible that two week time frame is certainly no one is expecting anything until well into september
8451992 a combination of british energy and centrica solves the problems facing both companies today
8451993 together they can work out a joint venture with edf to build nuclear sites
8451994 we will make sure there is enough sites and land available for other operators other than edf to come into the uk because we will need that too if we are to really ramp up our investment in nuclear over the shortest time frame
8451995 there is a good offer on the table representing good value we think for the government edf are the right partners to develop new nuclear for sure
8451996 given their unrivalled international expertise as nuclear operators they will bring a very great deal of expertise in to the benefit of the uk and i think we should move ahead with that deal as soon as we can
8451997 its a reaction to the fact that the system is tight this morning and we have got 20m cubic metres of demand missing from the interconnector
8451998 obviously the market thought that the system was going to be very comfortable for the interconnector maintenance period
8451999 we believe that despite the current economic environment our targeted blue chip customers in particular those in the public sector and regulated industries will continue with their investment programmes
8452000 we at the iasb are committed to continuing and completing our joint work programme with the fasb
8452001 the result of our work will be an improved set of ifrss to assist investors throughout the world
8452002 fundamentals for both the copper and molybdenum markets remain solid and we expect this to continue well into 2009
8452003 with our sound financial position we continue to make good progress with the groups plans for sustainable growth and this should result in further profitable volume growth from 2010 and beyond
8452004 this is a good time to invest with company valuations and debt multiples back to more sensible levels realisations however will be harder to achieve
8452005 i move senator obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8452006 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for president of the united states by acclamation
8452007 i have been asked to inform you that senator obama accepts the nomination
8452008 you want to vote according to what is in your heart i am not going to tell you what to do you have come from different places and made a long journey
8452009 president clinton will lay out the choices that we face on foreign policy
8452010 he will talk about how barack obama has what it takes to be a strong commander in chief
8452011 is at more of a high water mark than we are
8452012 one thing we never run into out there is a john mccain field organization
8452013 we think this is something that should be welcomed and celebrated the fact that were opening this up to average americans its been a great organizational tool we think about states colorado is a big battleground state and if it slips into the obama column from the mccain column his path just got a lot lot harder one of our best organizations now in the entire country will be in colorado as a result of this convention and the activities tomorrow night
8452014 to unite our people and forge a clear national direction
8452015 abdullah does not have the minimal credibility needed to run the country day by day let alone to take it in the new directions we need to go in a complex world
8452016 it is time to face the music it is we who have been buried
8452017 what happened was not something so big as to change the situation that exists after the last general election
8452018 i think abdullah should strongly consider for all our sakes to step down now
8452019 this is a second time that the malaysian people have given a clear message with the first at the general elections it is a rejection of the present leader and he must leave now
8452020 everything in a new home including the floor plan appliances decorating and exterior is usually more modern and cutting edge
8452021 i have not seen anything in new construction that offers the kind of detail and warmth that an older home has
8452022 things like inlaid tiles in a fireplace hearth an old porch interesting windows and style and history are all absent in a new house
8452023 buyers need to ask themselves do i like this house well enough to invest even more in it when looking at an older home
8452024 its important to create a quality media room within your means rather than spending the entire budget on a whole system get products with long term value by buying a few good pieces that will last
8452025 menubar no width 640 height 550 toolbar no resizeable yes scrollbars yes
8452026 its important to create a quality media room within your means rather than spending the entire budget on a whole system get products with long term value by buying a few good pieces that will last
8452027 the three big things to consider are the size of the room the budget you have and the quality of sound you want
8452028 it helps us when people bring in a diagram of the room when they visit
8452029 if its a large job we go to the home and make recommendations before you buy weve seen people spend anywhere from 2 000 to 500 000
8452030 it takes a lot of space for that kind of seating and electronics
8452031 also if we can get in while a home is under construction rather than after its done money can be saved in installation
8452032 were trying to bring back the days when people really looked forward to sitting down and listening to great sound
8452033 our service is more personalized than the big box stores because we know our stuff and can set it up for you
8452034 theyre making a huge comeback people want to listen to their old vinyl new technology and record cleaning systems make them sound like new again
8452035 go with someone you can get along with thats a priority i bought my first condo in birchwood two and a half years ago and a second one just recently as an investment both of my agents understood my needs and made it work for me
8452036 menubar no width 640 height 550 toolbar no resizeable yes scrollbars yes
8452037 whether planning to purchase or sell real estate to find an agent start by asking a friend family member or lender for a referral for someone theyve worked with
8452038 and if you have specific needs like a language barrier or special housing preferences ask an office broker to refer you to someone who has the best skills in that area
8452039 fifty percent of the agents out there have five years or less experience and may not be as familiar with the market in addition find out if they are full time or part time full timers tend to be more committed to keeping current ask if they have a resume you can review
8452040 there is a danger of missed opportunities if youre not working with a professional
8452041 anyone can show you houses but you need to have someone who understands home values to offer the appropriate price and negotiate for you
8452042 web sites are ok for research but dont choose an agent just by the quality of their site
8452043 how much they spent on their site isnt necessarily reflective of an agents skills and experience
8452044 looking at houses online is fine but real estate is a high touch business and the internet is no touch
8452045 having a real person to talk to you understand your needs and help you through the process of making the biggest purchase of your life is invaluable
8452046 menubar no width 640 height 550 toolbar no resizeable yes scrollbars yes
8452047 research which jurisdiction you want your children to enter and find a home in a corresponding neighborhood
8452048 is it a safe environment if so opt for a cul de sac if possible and choose a home with a back yard after that look for amenities in the house that correspond with your needs and price range
8452049 once they get older kids tend to have quite a bit of toys and other things so being able to keep their stuff in a playroom is handy a basement makes a great recreational room or playroom and a second bathroom is also ideal when you have kids
8452050 kids need a play area outside to run off all of that extra energy a large yard or a nearby park are great for exercise and fun a fenced yard is also a good feature to keep little ones from wandering away
8452051 we live in a cul de sac and it has been great for bike riding and all sorts of fun activities
8452052 i used to look after my lawn but i was inconsistent so i hired a company to do it for me i had mismanaged it by putting too much fertilizer on not watering it down and basically being inconsistent
8452053 menubar no width 640 height 550 toolbar no resizeable yes scrollbars yes
8452054 i used to look after my lawn but i was inconsistent so i hired a company to do it for me i had mismanaged it by putting too much fertilizer on not watering it down and basically being inconsistent
8452055 because the soil in whatcom county is very poor with lots of clay in it its a good idea to aerate the lawn once in spring and once in fall
8452056 because the soil quality is so poor dumping fertilizer is a bad idea because it washes right through
8452057 instead fertilize lightly and more frequently up to seven times a year to keep your lawn looking green and good
8452058 organic fertilizers release slower so you get a consistent grass growth and green lawn whereas a lot of man made fertilizers release too fast and that makes the grass grow too fast
8452059 be sure you never mow it shorter than two inches because if you do it will stress the grass and it wont grow back as fast anything that is stressed is weak
8452060 when you do this it will provide 25 percent of the fertilizer needs of the lawn
8452061 if you do it frequently you wont even know the clippings are there because they decompose and provide good fertilizer for the grass
8452062 menubar no width 640 height 550 toolbar no resizeable yes scrollbars yes
8452063 the agent you choose to work with should provide you with a personalized relocation packet suited to your interests and needs within two to three days of your initial e mail or telephone contact and should be comfortable in sending you virtual tours of properties that fit your requirements
8452064 its called s o r t which stands for separate organize recycle and trash go through your household and if you dont want to pay to have it moved get rid of it now
8452065 after that ensure you have an estimator come to the home and do a walk through providing you with a written estimate instead of just booking someone over the phone or internet
8452066 we recommend that homeowners keep their cash jewelry financial papers and anything that is irreplaceable in their own possession during the move
8452067 we put things we want to store in labeled storage bins and we only keep the items we need to use
8452068 menubar no width 640 height 550 toolbar no resizeable yes scrollbars yes
8452069 pick a sunny day lay down some tarps and organize your things putting like items together such as gardening equipment seasonal items and sports equipment
8452070 get a dumpster delivered to your home so you can get rid of things that have been sitting for years and can be trashed consider giving things to family or friends if you dont need them or alternatively donate them to a charity
8452071 inventory your garage possessions and design the ideal storage space you need around those items
8452072 no one has the same sorts of things in their garage so tailor your storage space to your needs
8452073 there are programs out there that help you get a visual idea of how your garage will look and function without dropping a lot of cash before you do something
8452074 make sure your garage is finished off with wall board as it gives it better insulation
8452075 one thing we havent done is finished off the inside of the garage and so in the winter its colder in there than id like it to be
8452076 theres a lot of people id like to help with code that i cant
8452077 were seeing some bad applications on the iphone its stifling innovation
8452078 my husband is a contractor so we were looking for something that needed a little help and could be easily renovated and updated
8452079 our goal was to keep our monthly payments low and have enough cash available to pay for improvements
8452080 so we were initially looking at an interest only mortgage with our 20 percent down payment
8452081 we looked at all the options available based on the mortgage brokers recommendations and found one that fit our goals in the long run
8452082 when you think about it everyone buys a home you have to have someone you trust advising you though the process
8452083 there are literally hundreds of different mortgage options available to buyers
8452084 there are the traditional fixed rate loans with terms of 30 20 or 15 years there are also a variety of adjustable rate mortgages available to buyers as well interest only loans have also become increasingly popular
8452085 theres a degree of instant gratification as the entire process happens much faster
8452086 you can be creative and put your hearts desire into a custom home
8452087 designing your home floor plan and finish work can be extremely rewarding and stressful all at once
8452088 building takes time but you can often get more of what you are looking for in a home
8452089 the first day we saw this property i could see the warmth and the potential for families to be in this welcoming environment they could feel like they were in a home instead of an agency building we knew we would have to do it right and our contractors made it happen
8452090 menubar no width 640 height 550 toolbar no resizeable yes scrollbars yes
8452091 the first day we saw this property i could see the warmth and the potential for families to be in this welcoming environment they could feel like they were in a home instead of an agency building we knew we would have to do it right and our contractors made it happen
8452092 we asked lots of people who theyd worked with the bia building industry association advised us to research our choice at the state l amp i web site and check on contractors status if they were licensed and current on their payments for insurance bonding and licenses
8452093 you can sign up to be notified if they became not current
8452094 we also took the time to see their previous projects
8452095 the key is chemistry with you and the contractor its as important as any other element
8452096 when youre building you have dreams hopes and a budget and need someone you can communicate that to when remodeling its valuable to find someone who can visualize improvements you may not have even thought of
8452097 the building permit process takes awhile timing is everything ask your contractor how you will fit into their workflow can they handle multiple projects and still get yours done on time
8452098 we wanted it to be accessible and green too we looked to leed leadership in energy and environmental design the u s green building council for information
8452099 shows that its 2d plus depth content format can be applied to blu ray thereby enabling a great 3d movie viewing experience on a variety of displays
8452100 people do not want any upkeep they are busy professionals boomers retirees singles and even students
8452101 lock the door and go thats the theme of condo living
8452102 many people who have lived in the same house for many years cant transition into a condo yet
8452103 even though their age and their children want them to be in a condo they end up choosing the little house with the small yard
8452104 this solution has not only allowed our agents to be freed from their desks to go out and get business but also reduced overheads in our phone bills
8452105 many businesses real estate included tend to work on having their employees supply their own phones and then reimbursing them
8452106 by owning the phones however we can have them on the same plan remove the cost of interoffice calls and as an additional and maybe the most important benefit we keep the contact number so if an agent moves on to a competitor we still own the contacts that come through the phones
8452107 commercial real estate is a competitive business and to us we need our people out showing property or evaluating listings not sat at their desks
8452108 as our business has grown we realised the importance of mobility to let our people work more efficiently out on the road communication is key to our business
8452109 tamco made the upgrade process simple and designed a system that met the needs of our business they are always keen to follow up and assist and explain we received training and have ongoing support which is vital to a customer facing organisation
8452110 the biggest reason for city living is for the variety of neighborhoods available to buyers
8452111 each area has its own feel and character from older craftsman type homes in south hill to new subdivisions to exclusive areas like edgemoor and lake whatcom
8452112 most buyers choose a county home for its elbow room privacy and seclusion
8452113 cosmetic fixes include paint carpet and landscaping in short sweat equity
8452114 usually if you sink thousands of dollars into your home you dont necessarily get a good return on your investment
8452115 the best strategy is to put your money into the bathrooms and kitchen enjoy living in the space and then reap the benefits of those renovations when you want to sell
8452116 but to do it just before the time of sale does not make sense because you may or may not get that money back when you sell
8452117 trade out a faucet add a new backsplash or buy door hardware for visual appeal
8452118 anything to imply freshness and good maintenance by the previous owner is a good selling point
8452119 bathrooms for example are really easy to put granite countertops in because you can find these small quantities of slab readily available at local fabricators but what surfaces you choose depend on your home and the category of the sale in some cases laminate might make more sense
8452120 the quickest way to give a home an updated look is with paint
8452121 painting is relatively easy for a homeowner to do themselves and by choosing neutral colors that will appeal to buyers you can give a home a fresh look
8452122 is it attractive is it inviting does it make you want to enter the house
8452123 i painted it a soft buttermilk yellow with a crisp linen trim and black shutters and it made a 100 percent difference in the appeal of the property
8452124 consider retiling your entryway then your flooring and finally your countertops which can be attractively replaced with granite tiles a material that is half the price of granite slabs and presents lots of options in type color and price
8452125 for the dollar you spend on tile youll get at least 2 in value out of it the fact is if youre going from a basic floor covering to a tile solution youre going to enjoy an appreciation on your investment
8452126 there are also a lot of porcelain products out now where technology has helped create old world appearances put those tiles down and youll think theyve been there 200 years because they have this timeless look
8452127 a property will sell faster if it has great curb appeal so look at adding a fence if necessary to frame the house or give a sense of demarcation consider minor additions to the landscape if theyre lacking such as bedding plants or ceramic pots that bring the eye in
8452128 it looked like a tired old house because it had no curb appeal
8452129 its really about seeing whats there what the assets of a home are and about dealing with the liabilities in a straightforward and non expensive way
8452130 a good designer will help you see how to showcase your propertys best assets
8452131 rent a storage unit to store excess belongings and furniture if necessary
8452132 it may be necessary to add additional trim to show the lines of the interior more easily
8452133 for houses from the 1970s with unattractive paneling consider painting the paneling in attractive tones to make it seem more cottagey and less dark
8452134 if you replace the roof or put on new siding it will increase the marketability of your house but not necessarily the value to the amount youve invested because people expect siding and a roof
8452135 i spent 25 000 doing this and the realtor from whom i bought the house told me it increased the value of the home by 100 000
8452136 i bought books on renovation and studied up at the library if you take the time to learn you can usually find out how to do things quite easily
8452137 well it helps the environment of course less pollution in the air
8452138 maybe the green house gas effect is not as strong
8452139 we have noticed a change a decrease in the number of serious accidents in the past few months
8452140 if you drive a little bit slower not only will you save money on gas but you can also save your life
8452141 i think that some of the programs that the registry has put in place like the junior operator law and melanies law have made a real impact in the quality of drivers and we have far fewer bad drivers on our roads
8452142 my husband is a contractor so we were looking for something that needed a little help and could be easily renovated and updated
8452143 our goal was to keep our monthly payments low and have enough cash available to pay for improvements
8452144 so we were initially looking at an interest only mortgage with our 20 percent down payment
8452145 we looked at all the options available based on the mortgage brokers recommendations and found one that fit our goals in the long run
8452146 when you think about it everyone buys a home you have to have someone you trust advising you though the process
8452147 there are literally hundreds of different mortgage options available to buyers
8452148 there are the traditional fixed rate loans with terms of 30 20 or 15 years there are also a variety of adjustable rate mortgages available to buyers as well interest only loans have also become increasingly popular
8452149 a lender may advertise a fantastic rate but its important to understand the actual cost of the loan
8452150 if a borrower is paying excessive fees to buy down the interest rate the lowest rate may in fact cost the customer more than if they had taken a higher rate and paid fewer lender fees
8452151 i had made a lot of money in real estate and had substantial holdings
8452152 i had to decide whether to retire or buy a nice home on the water
8452153 i wanted to have the ability to make large principal payments on my mortgage
8452154 i also wanted the principal to be recasted adjusted for the payment to reflect the new lower principal amount after i made a large payment
8452155 i feel mortgage lending has little to do with the institution that lends the money and more to do with the individual at the institution
8452156 to me this is about relationships and working with someone i can trust i totally trust my mortgage advisers
8452157 typically ive observed that homebuyers receive better service when dealing with lenders that have a local presence in their market
8452158 i would recommend using either a reputable bank or mortgage company with loan consultants that can meet you in person

8452188 i dont think we are over the worst in the uk i expect to see further falls in capital values over the balance of this year and first half of next year
8452189 the business model we have developed over the last three years we think is a good robust model to deal with changing and different market conditions around the world
8452190 as governments across the world seek to do more without raising taxes
8452191 sadly crime is on the rise in just about every country you can think of
8452192 double digit revenue growth for 2008 and the foreseeable future
8452193 we have made a strong start to 2008 and we see excellent growth opportunities ahead as our customers experience increasing global economic and social pressures
8452194 in the us market the acquisition of si international will enhance our scale capabilities relationships and market access in the worlds largest contracting market
8452195 these changes demonstrate that the rbs board is getting to grips with its governance
8452196 confidence in him is very low largely as he was saying everything is wonderful before the crisis
8452197 weve had meetings with wpp at which weve identified further synergies
8452198 we have maintained the momentum of our top line growth and again ensured that the heineken brand outperforms the market and increases its share of the international premium segment
8452199 on this basis we fear that the profit contribution was down 64pc although we would expect a fall in profit during a transitional period against a very challenging uk market environment this fall would be dramatic and call into question the likely contribution for the full year and indeed into 2009
8452200 the stronger than expected us durable goods orders data bodes well for business investment in the third quarter
8452201 we cannot go into specifics as it is an internal matter
8452202 we expect to see significant investment in new and replacement production capacity by our customers particularly in our core markets
8452203 notwithstanding recent reductions in forecast short term global economic growth prospects the broad environment in which the group operates remains underpinned by long term factors and demand for our services continues to be very strong
8452204 judging by the plans of our clients we think that there is a lot more growth to come
8452205 the industry has absolutely no choice the cost of production is going up they have to spend their money
8452206 has a great franchise which has existed through many crises through a long period of time
8452207 because our reserves are invested with a long term horizon this long term orientation will keep us from selling in panic in a market downturn
8452208 the downturn also offers opportunities for our agencies to invest in good quality assets at prices that are attractive from a long term perspective
8452209 these new products are available to both new and existing customers

8452211 the way this works is im going to introduce the solution in this bag into your rectum i need you to hold it in as long as you possibly can and then to relieve yourself in the bathroom
8452212 im now going to insert the nozzle into your anus
8452213 oh yeah baby im fucking you now yeah im putting my hard cock right into your tight pussy yeah its going in and out in and out and you love it thats right you love that hard cock in your tight pussy

8452215 im inserting the nozzle into your anus let me know if youre finding anything to be uncomfortable
8452216 that nurse just did to me what hitler did to poland
8452217 i think its safe to say that im as ready as i have ever been or ever will be
8452218 this is crazy i was throwing up all night then the nurse and i had an enema party then i got up at 7 in the morning to give myself a sponge bath and then somebody stuck a camera up my ass for a couple hours and how exactly is all of this making me get better
8452219 we found what appeared to be a small ulcer in the lining of the duodenum we did not take a sample for a biopsy but we can at a later date in the meantime im going to prescribe a medication called
8452220 an ulcer certainly isnt causing all of this health problems
8452221 but by scoping we are able to rule out more serious causes or conditions
8452222 well it will determine if williams problems are being caused by a bacterial infection
8452223 high fever and chills and some of his other symptoms seem to suggest a viral cause
8452224 but dr acosta was treating him for a viral infection
8452225 he was on a full course of anti and they didnt do anything to make him better
8452226 well only know when we get the results of the cultures what the proper course of action should be
8452227 i think we have to consider a very unpleasant possibility
8452228 it gets to the heart of what we believe is one of the most important attributes of social entrepreneurs self awareness
8452229 h e realized he didnt have an answer when asked having started several nonprofits he was doing doing and more doing perhaps like many of us he took the why for granted

8452231 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8452232 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8452233 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8452234 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8452235 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8452236 i dont know how i can live now because none of my family is left
8452237 great franchise which has existed through many crises through a long period of time
8452238 the bottom line is financial institutions are still asking for more capital said mr shane oliver sydney based head of investment strategy at amp capital investors
8452239 theres still plenty of capital out there so theyre looking for somewhere to park that money
8452240 we had great confidence in john thain we had great confidence in the rest of the management and the board
8452241 the strength of the american financial system is the diversity and that no single bank or no single group of banks is really that large he said

8452260 people not defining themselves as green doing green things and others that said they were green and drove suvs and had big houses
8452261 that only a small minority of those who want a healthier environment and consider themselves environmentalists engage in environmentally sustainable behavior
8452262 its easier to feel green than to act green schadler writes
8452263 feeling green doesnt cost any time or money or force you to change your habits or accept something new or different
8452264 and asking consumers to spend a premium on a green product is the most hassle filled commitment at all
8452265 he seems to be uncowed and unapologetic about anything that is happening
8452266 im confident the final results will give us a primary victory and we can move on to the general election
8452267 im not stepping down im going to run through and win this election
8452268 we have already seen attempts to buy this senate seat by outsiders who do not represent the best interest of alaska
8452269 theyve staked their careers on providing for people in communities through earmarks and other says
8452270 thats created a lot of obligations particularly in the construction industry and industry that relies on buildings and facilities and roads and whatever it might be theyre sort of collecting those chips now at least is
8452271 on energy alaskans know that i will fight every day to open anwr while mark tells his liberal friends that he is carefully cautious about drilling and only wants move forward when the environment is right
8452272 now is the time to open anwr and alaskans will need someone with experience to get that job done
8452273 this is going to be a battle between a younger person not quite as mature as i am not as experienced as i am does have talent do they want to do that replacement at this period of time
8452274 what people want to talk about are issues of energy of health care and of taxes
8452275 whatever ben at least im not afraid of the kitchen

8452277 sostener que constitucionalmente la protecci n a la vida en gestaci n es absoluta llevar a a violentar derechos fundamentales de la mujer reconocidos en la constituci n consider ndola mero instrumento reproductivo
8452278 la posibilidad de conceptualizar el derecho a la vida con un estatus constitucional
8452279 siento que una mujer que de alg n modo tiene que vivir el fen meno de haber quedado embarazada cuando no quiere tener al producto de ese embarazo pues por razones biol gicas tendr de alg n modo que sufrir las afectaciones durante todo el tiempo de la gestaci n
8452280 el derecho a la vida esta protegido por la constituci n expresamente y no as el derecho a la mujer para decidir unilateralmente sobre su cuerpo
8452281 alienta la pr ctica rutinaria de abortos y esto es contrario a nuestro natural instinto de reproducci n de la especie
8452282 se les desvaloriza como personas y se les reduce a instrumentos de procreaci n
8452283 obama supports abortion a system responsible for the murder of children
8452284 what were celebrating is something that we should be mindful of and that is that there absolutely is in our party a tremendous intersection of faith and politics
8452285 inherent in the practice of the death penalty is the practice of mental torture
8452286 if we understand what were doing in our own killing chambers we will better understand what happened at abu ghraib and whats happening at guantanamo and how it has happened that our own attorney general and lawyers from our justice department employed shocking legalisms to bypass the geneva conventions in order to legitimize torture of suspected terrorists
8452287 our children have sacred value and each child is equally valuable
8452288 some of us democrats have philosophic humanitarian and theological differences with those who put forth abortion as an appropriate routine and acceptable birth control procedure
8452289 surely we cannot be pleased with the routine administration of millions of surgically terminated pregnancies
8452290 something within us must be calling for a better way if we do not resist at this point at what point will we resist
8452291 we didnt move to bring faith to the party faith was already here
8452292 democrats are have been and will continue to be people of faith and millions of people of faith have been and will continue to be people of faith

8452304 dangerous and demeaning work that robs them of their childhood and often their future
8452305 in many countries child labor inspectors do not receive adequate training and are vulnerable to corruption due to low salaries
8452306 there is a broad array of efforts now underway to eliminate the worst forms of child labor
8452307 this report reveals that many governments are demonstrating the will to change childrens lives but it also makes clear that there is much more still to do to protect children around the world from exploitive child labor
8452308 while the report showed a decline in the incidence of child labor around the world there are still millions of undocumented children working under hazardous and exploitive conditions
8452309 many of these children are forced to endure horrendous hardships because their survival depends on it and their families rely on their income
8452310 comparing poverty across countries the role of purchasing power parities
8452311 in a region that has witnessed rapid economic growth it might be time to evaluate poverty incidence using a benchmark that reflects the regions dynamism
8452312 the owner is excited and very much looks forward to developing and completing the project

8452317 higher and rising inflation is having an effect on pay negotiations in the private sector but pressure on profits is also a key part of the picture as the economic outlook worsens

8452319 based on current market conditions we are targeting growth in underlying eps earnings per share of at least 10 per cent for the 2008 09 financial year he said

8452321 a return to full pre flood production levels at coppabella is not expected until january 2009 ms hollows said
8452322 market conditions in general are not expected to improve over the balance of the year it said

8452324 sacking principals turning over staff closing schools that churning and instability that will occur in that process is not going to help students and may in fact damage communities
8452325 the plans that kevin rudd has put forward simply wont make a systematic or system wide difference to education
8452326 this offer is a compelling transaction for quiksilver said robert mcknight chairman and chief executive
8452327 the emissions trading scheme is nothing more than a tax
8452328 it is effectively a tax on the use and certainly the emissions of carbon and in the end australians all of us are going to pay for it
8452329 it will increase the price of everything from energy to transport and fuel it is likely to see industries and jobs go to other parts of the world
8452330 this is the most significant economic transformation that we will see in our country
8452331 there is an enormous amount at stake and mr rudd seems to not think things through
8452332 he mr rudd doesnt seem to appreciate whats at stake here in terms of pensioners families jobs and australian industries
8452333 weve said from day one that this is a very substantial reform
8452334 out there there is a broad understanding of the significance of the reform that were undertaking here
8452335 most models now show it is on a collision course for the gulf of mexicos productive regions with memories of hurricane katrina still fresh in most participants minds it is understandable that prices have broken sharply higher said john kilduff analyst at mf global
8452336 evacuating personnel not essential to producing and drilling operations in the gulf
8452337 labor says they want safer greener cars yet they are proposing a tax which will discourage innovation in these areas
8452338 labors luxury car tax surcharge is a tax grab based on the politics of envy
8452339 it is bad policy and will be opposed by the coalition
8452340 you do realize you have to invite me in right ive been barred from this house ever since your grandfather took up residence
8452341 i know grandad just told me to make sure you had to ask to come in so welcome to the harris estate and please come in try not to steal anything
8452342 i see your looks werent the only thing you inherited from your grandfather
8452343 my name by the way is madison harris i know yours but i think ill be like grandad and just call you deadboy
8452344 and much as i enjoy the chance to chitchat and trade witty quips with an enemy of my grandads i think i need to get to the point
8452345 hes dying he wanted to see you before he passed on
8452346 i can hear you out there get your pale clammy butt in here
8452347 well dont just stand there deadboy come in and dont worry about being tempted by my blood ive got so little left by now youd have trouble getting a good appetizer out of me
8452348 im sorry xander especially now i still havent been able to find them
8452349 that i knew deadboy despite our many differences thats the one thing we have in common if youd found them you would have told me so i could die happy
8452350 after all these years i know youd give anything for it not to have happened
8452351 so would i time travel was beyond even amys capacity unfortunately
8452352 sometimes in my supreme xanderlike arrogance i do forget that they were all your friends too
8452353 in any event thats why i called you here i want an oath from you
8452354 first i want you promise me that someday you will find spike and rip his goddamned head off
8452355 second when youre done come back here no matter how long it takes i think shell finally be at peace then
8452356 madison takes after his grandmother hes as powerful as amy ever was after i die his instructions are to cast some kind of spell to keep it from harm no matter how long it takes 1630 revello drive will be here when you come back swear to it
8452357 i vow that i will hunt down and kill spike for what he did to buffy and then i will return here no matter how long it takes
8452358 well get to it then you dont have forever oh thats right you do
8452359 there is a russia narrative that we were weak in the 90s but now we are back and we are not going to take it anymore but being angry and seeking revanchist victory is not the sign of a strong nation it is the sign of a weak one
8452360 russia is going to have to come to terms with the reality it can either integrate with the world or it can be a self isolated bully but it cant be both and thats a choice russia has to have
8452361 they are kind of giddy they will need to sober up
8452362 when they sober up they will see that it is not the u s that has done things to them its that they have done things to themselves
8452363 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel economic and political losses
8452364 no one asked what impact its actions had on the russian stock market there was no russian stock market
8452365 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8452366 the georgian people won their freedom after years of tyranny and they can count on the friendship of the united states
8452367 three american presidents bush clinton and bush have all in their own way sought to encourage russias integration with the wider world this is a good thing it was the right set of policies
8452368 russia has now put all of that at risk because russian cannot simultaneously behave like the soviet union toward its neighbors like this is 1968 and act as if it is 2008 when it comes to the wto
8452369 there are areas where we have common interest with russia and we want to work with them the question is whether russia has an ability to work with us
8452370 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8452371 there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it
8452372 twenty five winners will each receive 2 return flights from singapore to kuala lumpur flying jetstar provided by chan brothers travel pte ltd
8452373 at this location the effort is due out september 17th via spinefarm records
8452374 we dont need to change our bodies we need to change the rules
8452375 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8452376 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8452377 lo que dije fue que me ten a que plantear muchas cosas porque fue un fracaso personal no llegar a la final ya que estuve cerca de 12 meses preparando los juegos y por tanto cuando no salen bien las cosas la decepci n es grande
8452378 el balance de la temporada no est tan mal porque estuve por encima de los 20 metros casi siempre
8452379 el a o que viene puedo estar a un nivel alto y mientras la ilusi n se mantenga creo que debo seguir
8452380 apueste econ micamente m s por el atletismo para elevar el nivel
8452381 el atletismo espa ol camina hacia un sitio tenebroso si no se trabaja desde la base y hay pruebas que cuentan con recambios pero en otras va a ser complicado encontrarlos
8452382 en italia los mejores atletas se re nen una vez al mes durante 15 d as en centros de alto rendimiento pero si nosotros hici ramos una o dos de esas reuniones gastar amos todo el presupuesto
8452383 tambi n falta dinero para poder entrenar la base y hacer captaci n de talentos porque los corredores no salen espont neamente
8452384 llega un momento en el que a o a a o tienes que plantearte las cosas y parte importante para seguir o no son los resultados ya que condicionan las ayudas
8452385 no me gusta hacer quinielas e intento no pensar en ellas porque me parece que meten a n m s presi n y eso es un fallo grave de nuestro presidente jos mar a odriozola que las hace en p blico
8452386 why the sputtering liz claiborne conglomerate which had entertained offers for ms olsens label and others had not chosen just to sell it

8452388 beverly hills 90210 fans looking for a little on set drama between old nemesises shannen doherty and jennie garth during their return to the show are apparently going to be disappointed entertainment weekly
8452389 i think when youre 18 your personalities conflict then you meet up 10 or 15 years later and the playing ground is totally different and youre fine
8452390 i dont know ive thought a lot about that obviously coming down here to the minors to work on some things as a starter i dont see unless something else is going on a slot in that rotation so ill probably be back in that bullpen and trying to help in whatever way possible whether it would be relief long relief eating up innings or starting or whatever whatever it takes to help that team win a division and win a championship
8452391 think of it as a baseball swing i was very level with my shoulder swing as a pitcher you dont want that you want to think almost like youre chopping down when you hit down on it youre going to come through i wasnt doing that on a consistent basis and im much more consistent with it now and im getting a lot better action on my pitches now hitters have two planes to worry about you have the ball coming in at you as a lefty and also going down as opposed to just coming in body wise im good everybody has got their little aches and pains but nothing different for me
8452392 definitely the bullpen has been a saving grace being down there and observing them they believe in one another and they know that theyre there to back up the starters that theyre there to back up each other and i think that they have a real camaraderie that is expressed in their performance one guy does well the other guy doesnt want to blow it for that guy and the offense is starting to click a little bit with jimmy rollins getting it going and chase utley is chase hes going to always produce its looking good for this upcoming month
8452393 hes worked through some struggles of his own this year it hasnt all been glitz and glamour hes had to modify his mechanics a little bit hes had to change the way he approaches his setup to throw a pitch so guys dont know whats coming thats not the easiest thing to do
8452394 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8452395 a lot of the women who dropped off the list this year were for job related reasons
8452396 in some cases its simply a matter of the woman still has a powerful position but other women are relatively more powerful and pushed her down and off the list
8452397 certainly had she been the democratic nominee that probably would have catapulted her higher
8452398 shes still an incredibly powerful force shes way more powerful than any other female senator
8452399 i dont like the way the republicans are taking this country
8452400 the producers pink sneakers productions of apopka fla told me they plan to have talent scouts on the festival grounds on sunday aug 31 and monday sept 1
8452401 its a little out of the ordinary for us but we think its a great opportunity to give festival attendees a little extra labor day weekend fun during their festival visit
8452402 you really wouldnt want to live there its being rented because its a probate house no one wants to buy it as the previous owner died in it but that doesnt seem to bother amy
8452403 simple and compact ping feed that web services can produce in order to alert the consumers of their feeds when a feed has been updated
8452404 friendfeed downloads millions of rss and atom feeds every hour
8452405 that takes up a lot of resources on our end and on the other end sup makes it much more efficient and lets us check much more frequently like every minute or every couple of seconds instead of every half hour
8452406 were going to release sup for comments and feedback from other feed publishers and consumers in a few weeks

8452408 a maize shirt costs you a maximum of 16 dollars and even thats only if you get the official t shirt wear it
8452409 when was the last time you were this excited for a season to start
8452410 some have compared it to an upgrade i compare it to a transplant the body is the same but the substance is entirely new
8452411 predicting it is fine for the sake of kicks but its not a scientifically valid approach
8452412 you have to assume that everything that has happened in the past will continue in the future
8452413 freakiness of athletic talent at the extreme margins of humanity bolt it turns out is a perfect example
8452414 typically when you get someone that big they cant start
8452415 we dont really know what the best form is and maybe bolt is redefining that and showing us we missed something
8452416 the limits will be largely set by the rules of the ioc
8452417 its kind of an arms race with the regulators of the sport and the people trying to push the technology to the limits at some point here there must be a d tente where technology cant push us any further and the rules will restrict it
8452418 you could see really freakish things and we probably will
8452419 if youre going to read only one thing make it this
8452420 i read it and it works id recommend it for anyone

8452429 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8452430 with market conditions likely to remain volatile for the rest of this year delivering growth in the short term will continue to be challenging but we remain confident in the medium to long term outlook for the wealth management industry chief executive craig dunn who started in the position on january 1 said
8452431 while amp will prudently manage through these market conditions we will also continue to invest where we see potential growth opportunities that position us well over the medium to long term mr dunn said
8452432 m amp a can be legitimate but it would have to be strategically relevant he said
8452433 we expect margins to contract by 2 to 3 per cent per annum over the longer term because of the competitive market in which we operate he said
8452434 our capital strategy is aimed at enhancing this already strong position in the current climate increasing business flexibility to grow and further optimising our capital mix mr dunn said

8452436 it would indeed be very nice if we could convert any one cell type into a different one
8452437 a very elegant and important contribution to the reprogramming field
8452438 i learned to say thank you i learned to say its nice to meet you
8452439 i learned the basics even though i wasnt fluent and we are not looking for perfection were not looking for fluency in a language were just looking for basic communication skills that will help our players interact with pro am partners with the media and with the acceptance speeches
8452440 some of the players understand where the lpga is coming from because as an organization theyre going to have to have marketing assets
8452441 but as far as having a penalty being suspended from the tour it is a little harsh for them they feel
8452442 my personal opinion is if you go to korea and play golf for two years would the korean people expect them to speak korean after two years you know if you switch the people around what are they expecting isnt that too much
8452443 ive heard lots of different lists of the most difficult languages for english speakers to learn and korean is always at the top of those lists along with japanese and arabic
8452444 and its just as difficult for them to learn english as it is for us to learn korean
8452445 it used to be that if you were good at sports it was a bad sign it meant you were not good at studies
8452446 parents would often discourage their kids from playing sports now korean parents see sports as a way to become americanized and get ahead
8452447 theyre offering them a place in their house to come and spend the night or food and housing for the week
8452448 and when theres no dialogue because the player cant communicate were finding that housing is difficult to find for asian players because theyve had bad experiences

8452481 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8452482 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8452483 receiving or reading these widespread emails themselves does not mean you are infected but if users open the attachment they will be infecting their windows computer they will give hackers an open door to take control and steal information
8452484 while riding the course i kept thinking to myself that we must be on the wrong road there is just simply no way a time trial would have this much climbing
8452485 at the reassurance from my coach and much to my delight we were on the right course
8452486 i was then able to trace the entire course from the comfort of my home and find a similar route to train on back in boise
8452487 this capability along with having the elevation profile proved invaluable in my preparation for my gold medal race
8452488 more than 1 5 billion in private u s funds go to israel annually
8452489 i just heard a report on national public radio those monsters are going to allow al jazeera to be broadcast in vermont i cant believe theyll allow that propaganda on the radio
8452490 dont you think that building a wall is somewhat reminiscent of the wall constructed around the warsaw ghetto during world war ii
8452491 i cant believe that a jew would say such a thing are you a maniac do you want to harm israel
8452492 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
8452493 the individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists
8452494 when you go back and you look at the strategic review document none of it has ever been implemented but the thrust of what was discussed in that document was on the slaughter side not on the processing side that were talking about here today
8452495 those that might characterize paperwork in a derogatory sense i would challenge given that that scientific review demonstrates the safety and security of the entire process used to produce food
8452496 this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8452497 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully we have and we continue to improve on our action plans
8452498 we will not re start the plant until this investigation is complete and ive signed off on it personally

8452510 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8452511 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8452512 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8452513 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8452514 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8452515 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8452516 mark was such a brilliant artist his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him

8452525 duplicated source code can be an indicator for quality problems
8452526 having the same algorithm spread across the whole application in slightly different variations will lead to increased maintenance effort which ultimately may result in inconsistencies
8452527 clone detective makes it easy for developers to perform a clone detection and visualize the existing clones however in some cases the source duplication cannot be easily removed e g the cost of removing the clones outweighs the costs of keeping them due to heavy design change requirements
8452528 in this case clone detective helps by reminding you that a given portion of code is duplicated by a purple bar in the code editor so if you make changes to it you should review the other occurrences and make sure you keep your application consistent
8452529 fuzzy clones are clones that are almost identical but not token by token this will allow you to find existing inconsistencies in your code base
8452530 were going to work on projects and specify designs that prg can work on with us and we hope that prg will choose us for jobs for which they can recommend a design firm

8452536 bill is one of the best communicators that i know
8452537 i have had a number of positions in this industry but i am really looking at this one to be the last one
8452538 living systems are intrinsically robust against cells dying or being damaged
8452539 the behaviour of most organs is an emerging feature resulting from the interaction of many cells where no cell is particularly robust or even aware of the whole behaviour
8452540 the starting point in winsoc was to provide mathematical models of biological systems and translate them into algorithms to determine how the sensor nodes should interact with each other
8452541 our indian partners have buried sensors in the terrain with the capability of monitoring the humidity and porosity of the terrain and the acceleration forces
8452542 the sensors are then linked to a satellite which gathers the data and conveys them to the control centre
8452543 the first is related to the monitoring of the earth with a system capable of autonomous decisions
8452544 this is particularly important in remote areas where it is difficult to recharge batteries or replace defective nodes
8452545 we believe that cross fertilisation of ideas from biology to engineering and vice versa can provide substantial benefits to both areas
8452546 las razones de esa disparidad son en parte demogr ficas
8452547 dado que el vih prevalece entre esos grupos el riesgo de infecci n por contacto sexual es mayor

8452555 seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently
8452556 simulation a feigning to be what one is not or dissimulation a concealment of ones real character or motives more generally hypocrisy is simulation or the assuming of a false appearance of virtue or religion a deceitful show of a good character in morals or religion a counterfeiting of religion beware ye of the leaven of the pharisees which is hypocrisy luke 12 simulation deceitful appearance false pretence hypocrisy is the necessary burden of villainy
8452557 he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this one will be blessed in what he does
8452558 lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word which is able to save your souls

8452565 but im delighted that ive got the opportunity to represent the nt
8452566 the reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me
8452567 therefore i will give praise to you among the gentiles and i will sing to your name
8452568 praise the lord all you gentiles and let all the peoples praise him
8452569 there shall come the root of jesse and he who arises to rule over the gentiles in him shall the gentiles hope
8452570 has it ever occurred to you that one hundred pianos all tuned to the same fork are automatically tuned to each other they are of one accord by being tuned not to each other but to another standard to which each one must individually bow so one hundred worshipers meeting together each one looking away to christ are in heart nearer to each other than they could possibly be were they to become unity conscious and turn their eyes away from god to strive for closer fellowship
8452571 as i live says the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall give praise to god
8452572 blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of god
8452573 a certain man gave a great supper and invited many

8452631 this is a promising new lead in the search for biological pathways that contribute to obesity
8452632 this finding may eventually lead to the development of new drugs to regulate appetite in people who have not had success with other treatments
8452633 in fighting climate change we must look beyond the emissions from our own operations and look closely into the products and services we use and the suppliers we work with i am very pleased that defra is one of the first organisations to participate in this really important pilot project
8452634 i am pleased that the fco through its collaboration with the carbon disclosure project is leading government in the area of gaining a better understanding of the impacts of its expenditure decisions on carbon emissions throughout the supply chain understanding the carbon emissions and policies of our suppliers will help to embed the sustainability agenda within our procurement decision making
8452635 gloucestershire county council is committed to both minimising our own carbon emissions and working with our partners to reduce emissions from the whole county we are pleased to be part if this pioneering initiative to understand the carbon impact of council purchasing we are working with 2 000 of our suppliers to help them understand the impacts of their products and services and so reduce our contribution to further climate change
8452636 the public sector has enormous power to shape new markets through its procurement practices and these organisations are showing the way in the development of a low carbon economy by joining this project the public sector has positioned itself at the cutting edge of this issue and will be learning with the private sector rather than from it
8452637 because of speculation among scientists that viral infections provoke the inflammation that increases the risk of macular degeneration we tested for associations between amd and tlr3 which is known to support innate immunity and host defense
8452638 if you are genetically susceptible to macular degeneration and are exposed to a virus that activates tlr3 it could lead to the death of cells in the macula
8452639 ironically in some individuals using rnai to cure wet amd might actually increase the risk for blindness from dry amd
8452640 these findings pave the way for using tlr3 inhibitors as a potential new therapy for dry amd and simultaneously highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by rnai based therapies
8452641 what tlr3 does in the case of perceived infection is to sacrifice infected cells in this case retinal pigment epithilial cells to protect the neighborhood
8452642 biologically well intentioned though the sacrifice may be it can lead to blindness
8452643 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available
8452644 the 2008 report finds that campus leaders value sustainability they speak about it plan for it hire staff to support it and the campuses they lead are steadily becoming greener models for the wider society
8452645 at the same time the educational curricula to prepare students for a post college world influenced by climate change are not keeping pace on most campuses the business leaders and facilities managers appear to be making greater strides towards sustainability than their faculty peers
8452646 this report card tells us there is a widening gap between where higher education actually is on teaching sustainability versus where it should be
8452647 given the environmental challenges and opportunities this generation will face i find this cause for deep concern and am committed to working with our partners to address this on both state and federal levels
8452648 the nwf report card is the gold standard for charting the sustainability movement in higher education coverage of both operational and academic programs is particularly important strongly recommended reading for administrators faculty and students
8452649 the campus environment 2008 report card reveals just how well institutions of higher learning are preparing students for the environmental challenges they will face in the 21st century
8452650 many of the men and women who will lead our businesses educational institutions and government agencies in the next 20 years are in college now
8452651 we need to offer todays college students the kind of academic and professional preparation that will ready them to envision and create a healthier and more sustainable world

8452731 the sizeable pay increases we are seeing in mid level it support and technical roles is being driven largely by acute skills shortages
8452732 as the uk it sector continues to specialise in more high end technical work and more entry level jobs are outsourced overseas there are fewer opportunities for graduates and those with less experience to get a foot on the first rung of the career ladder
8452733 the knock on effect is that higher up that ladder where there is demand for skilled and experienced workers there is not enough supply coming through the ranks making recruitment and retention more difficult driving up salaries as a result
8452734 our research has clearly shown that customers value the ability of windows to alert them when they may have software that is not genuine but they also want the ability to stay up to date with the least effort required on their part

8452740 we really have what we like to to joke and call the a team which is michael lincoln sara mahone sucre and bellick all of these wildly different people many of whom hated each other at some point obviously there is history between mahon and the boys and its at its core great television because it is all about people rubbing up against each other the the wrong way and i think that is at the core of what prison break has always done very well which is you know six or eight guys in a room at each others throat but they have to work together to achieve a common goal and that is exactly what we have created for the season
8452741 season 4 certainly has a vibe of mission impossible dare i say
8452742 every season is like something new something different it is like shooting a different movie and they have kept true to that every episode every season especially for me i get to be a like a chameleon
8452743 because of circumstance the characters on the show most of the characters are going to have to find a common ground together to to accomplish something and the best of what they have all done they have to bring it to the table now it is the only way it is going to happen the ball game this year
8452744 i think prison break for the last three seasons has been reinvented you know first it was in the prison second season was on the run the third season was back in a new you know worse prison and then now this season its completely reinvented because everybody is free and there is one common goal where everybody is going to die or be thrown back in prison
8452745 we have to reinvest every year and we have to go back and do all of our homework again about why are we telling this story and what is compelling about it and what is our personal investment and what is our characters investment in it and i think that means that every year we get kind of either a shot in the arm or a slap in the face depending on how it feels at the time and that is what i think makes the show work
8452746 not only is it ongoing in a serial sort of way but it clearly picks a direction for a season we are going to throw you in this direction and i think that is why prison break is still around for a fourth season is because of the talent of our writing staff you know can figure out you know what is the that new direction going to be and obviously it works
8452747 people are always saying okay what are you going to do next now you broke out for the season what are you going to do next and we came up with the fugitive thing and the pursuit of all of us and then okay now what are you going to do next and we ended up in i mean in prison again but it is slightly different so now we broke out so okay what are you going to do next i mean people are always questioning us and yet we keep you know we keep stepping up to the plate
8452748 i think at some point were going to have to deal with each other i just dont know how theyre going to do that yet our relationship is very bizarre its you know she was my captive and she escaped so im not sure if im angry or if that doesnt really mean all that much to me because you know i i did fool the boys and they did think she was dead for a little while so well see well see what they have in store for me this year
8452749 my characters name is wyatt he doesnt need a last name he just goes by one name basically hes a coldblooded killer a killer for hire the guy that you call when you need it done you just need it all cleaned up hes a cleaner and has no remorse for what he does its just its just a job and he just happens to be good at it i think that he would like to be your normal person if he could but he cant i work for pad man so you know fans of the show would know who pad man is i work for pad man im not a company guy ive been called in because things arent going well so im kind of like you know the red phone guy pick up the red phone and call the guy that we need to do whos going to do it all and ive been in a nutshell called to clean up and clean up means anybody with any contact has to go no matter how minute you know whether theyre just related to someone or or really trying or you know really part of the group i got to clean them all up lincoln and michael are the main people im after and i mean it filters out to everybody basically everybody they touch i have to take care of them too but theyre my main focus is to find them and to take care of them i use a whole arsenal of guns i have a different gun for just about every job whether its long range short range silencer non silencer and then some interesting things some needles some torture devices everything
8452750 i play a character named roland who is being hes an addition to the team a homeland security agent brings him in because of my expertise in computer in computers and software and technology in in all things silicon related to help bring down the company so thats where my expertise is needed and im also working off a sentence of mine as well because im getting busted for federal identity theft which is now you know its a terrorist act so im facing some serious charges so the stakes are really high roland doesnt really in the very beginning he doesnt really quite fit in with the rest of the team you know michael michael scofield even says you know i we got our team we dont need this guy but then the but then don self played by michael rappaport says no this is this is my team im in charge of you and he is going to be a part of it so im kind of something thats forced onto the team but then i prove my value very quickly so the rest of the team i would say tolerates me i think thats the best way to put roland that hes tolerated because hes a necessary evil and a necessary nuisance you know
8452751 i play a character named don self this season on prison break who is you know in homeland security he works for the government and he has drafted the guys to do some work for for that will benefit them as far as you know keeping them out of prison and that will benefit my character and really sort of were im getting them to sort of take on the bad guy with me im a policeman essentially i mean thats im a government person but im the im the good guy and theyre the bad guys and you know however we you know theyre however we might be working together there is there is always that distance between all of us mahone character all of them and you know at the end of the day you know i have a gun and i have tracking devices on them so you know im the warden you know and theyre the prisoners
8452752 were in the secret warehouse thats by the docks its undisclosed and you know because we need our secrecy because you know obviously the country knows the faces of lincoln burrows and michael scoefield so this whole nice security agent has done everything he could to set up a home base in this abandoned warehouse by these docks
8452753 we all live together theres not much of privacy we all have our own what do you call those army beds i dont know soldier beds whatnot i dont know whats the name of those but anyway so theres not its like a platoon you know its like were you know were on a mission and we all have to somehow get along so you know thats not going to happen and were talking about from the characters point of view you know theres a lot of hatred between theres a lot of history and theres a lot of hatred going on between these characters
8452754 its like the prison break ctu you know all the and we have like a new character played by a guy named james his name is roland and he is the technical wizard and so weve got you know the technical guy and then everybody else trying to do their deal and trying to help in and pitch in
8452755 finally were shooting in los angeles first year they said that we were it was half a year in chicago and that didnt eventuate and then we thought we were heading back to l a and we ended up in dallas for two years and now were in l a and its home
8452756 its kind of exciting i think for those of us who commuted more or less and a lot of the guys with kids who are in school spent every weekend on the plane domino surfs every morning and is a much kindler gentler dominic its good for all of us i think
8452757 were back home which is amazing after being three years on the road i think that was enough you know dont get me wrong i had a great time in chicago i had a great time in dallas these are places that i probably would have mot lived there if not because of the show so it was a great experience but now were back home the storyline takes us home so as an actor point of view as amaury point of view im glad to be back home you know friends its my home its my patio
8452758 the interesting thing that we examine in the fourth season is now that hes back together with sarah is he still the man that she fell in love with once upon a time because third season michael thought sarah was dead and he crossed a line that he hadnt crossed before he was responsible for the death of another inmate at the panamanian prison that the the inmate who was killed when michael rigged the tunnel to collapse so is he the man that sarah once knew is he worthy of their relationship is he redeemable these are all rich and valuable questions
8452759 i know going to go teddys going to go through this or is going through this cathartic change right now obviously with the clothes and the look that i have right now of to try to fit into this particular company where he has to work but its whats underneath all that too is kind of interesting that hes he has an opportunity really change who he is and if he can believe it maybe other people can believe it as well i was a serial well he wasnt really a serial killer he just killed a lot of people
8452760 i think the characters have never been black and white you know theres always a complexity to them and obviously sarahs character is going to be bringing a lot of baggage and you know we get to see again the the the start of a new romance i i would say with michael and sarah because last year that was kind of cut short with her kind of disappearing and what happened to her this year we we get to explore those two
8452761 toward the end of the season last season link was living the high life with sophia and l j down in panama and he got into got himself into a situation in panama where he ended up suspecting that a company guy was after him and they got into a scuffle and and lincoln shot him
8452762 lincoln took a look at a head in a box and said i dont want to look at the head in the box its led to believe its sarah and is that sort of i think misdirect of having been told one thing and believing it and having that make it so but as it turns out it was not sarahs head
8452763 you guys left me inside a prison in panama with t bag basically running being the new emperor and it looks like julius cesar
8452764 third season ended with the boys escaping from from panama leaving the sona prison behind we thought that sarah was dead michael was on a revenge quest going after gretchen b in whistler and people that he thought were responsible and season 4 picks up a month later in los angeles and we find that the gang gets back together relatively quickly
8452765 its like putting those jeans that that just fit perfect thats what it is just working with these guys its dancing
8452766 i love working with great actors because you you just get better you know and you learn from from these guys i mean bills been in it for you know a long time and its always its always a joy to work with guys like that and you know peter stormare is a dear friend of mine and i learn a lot from him as an actor and i think thats one of the thats one of the great things about working especially on something you kind of really love you know you you you allow yourself to learn and grow and you know its yeah its its really cool
8452767 im really excited to be a part of the show i ive been having a lot of fun so far on prison break the guys are all good theyve been very welcoming
8452768 got no problems to say by far the you know best on camera you know thing that ive done one of the most harmonious work environments ive been on been embraced from day 1 made to feel like family by the entire cast
8452769 well i think the mission that you know were all asked to do or told to do or forced to do is not something thats i dont think i dont think any of us really want to be together maybe the brothers do its out of necessity of you know we all have our our agenda and the things that we want personally
8452770 the simple answer is that the reason we take on the assignment is because these people have to be stopped and we all have different reasons for stopping them some people want blood some people want justice some people have nothing else to do and need a task to focus themselves on but we all coalesce around this need to stop the company and to also to identify the company none of us knows who they are theyre just this colossal force thats been sort of buffeting our lives
8452771 i get a big toothy grin and i hate you i hate you
8452772 the company is kind of a mixture of corporation and government theyre like the puppeteers you know theyre like behind the scenes controlling for all those conspiracy theorists around you know theyre controlling everything from stocks to weapons to government relations they are big brother
8452773 ticket holders are not supposed to sell them but there is nothing to preclude them from doing so
8452774 we dont swab for listeria any more the industry does all that themselves
8452775 they just document all this stuff we read their reports if their reports say they do everything fine then they do everything fine
8452776 the fact is listeria needs a very high dose how did such meat products get contaminated with such a high level of listeria in order to cause so much illness it needs over a billion cells to actually cause illness

8452781 mccain is not a perfect man he can be a little emotional but he is fundamentally a good person i would feel comfortable waking up in the morning with john mccain as president

8452783 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8452784 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver for whom will you vote
8452785 this is the kind of question that i predict and this has nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at five 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent

8452832 lo importante es estar en el sorteo y que somos cabezas de serie no tenemos ninguna preferencia
8452833 lo fundamental es que estamos otra vez en la champions veremos qu rivales nos tocan nosotros estamos bien y podemos ganar a cualquiera
8452834 no necesito disimular este a o podemos ganar la champions soy realista y podemos rivalizar con cualquiera
8452835 volvemos con los m ximos objetivos tenemos una mentalidad ganadora y estamos preparados para hacer un buen torneo
8452836 my leg was straight and i couldnt bend it the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain
8452837 as you can see i am completely out of breath she really pushed me to the limit
8452838 i was just trying to come back to normal position where i could just stand up and regroup again and play the next point
8452839 i thought i was going to get my dress really dirty that was my biggest concern
8452840 i would have loved to take a nap on the court because i was really exhausted but you know the rules are the rules i had to keep going
8452841 we knew it was a difficult team to play against
8452842 they played good on counterattack it was difficult but we were playing better than in the first leg
8452843 our players earned this victory this is a big day for us its like we won the champions league tonight
8452844 when it was 0 0 at halftime it was looking good for us
8452845 we couldnt stay calm and that hurt us this is a difficult moment for us
8452846 we knew theyd dig in defensively we couldnt get past that wall
8452847 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8452848 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8452849 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8452850 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8452851 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8452852 the journey will be difficult the road will be long
8452853 so i started g 10 types of herbs and it is quite successful i have dill celery oregano thyme basil coriander parsley sage rosemarie mint and also rocket leaves for salad these are not big plants but most certainly serve our purpose in bringing more flavour and goodness into our daily meals and i just love them rocket leaves i can pick only once a fortnight but the rest grows beautifully most people are amazed at what i have done and i when i see the mowing machine and its operator i quietly point out to these little angels and beg of him not to run it off now the most important question which one of these herbs could withstand the weather in winter and those that cannot withstand the winter could i pot them and keep them inside
8452854 the american people are looking for change and for leadership
8452855 must be conversant in english by 2009 or face suspension
8452856 for an athlete to be successful today in the sports entertainment world we live in they need to be great performers on and off the course and being able to communicate effectively with sponsors and fans is a big part of this
8452857 being a u s based tour and with the majority of our fan base pro am contestants sponsors and participants being english speaking we think it is important for our players to effectively communicate in english
8452858 im so happy i won i dedicate this tournament to my family
8452859 dont they know theyre in america we speak english here i mean i think its funny when margaret cho makes fun of her parents accents but im not about to buy golf balls recommended by someone who doesnt even speak clearly
8452860 xenophobia rears its ugly head in all sorts of places
8452861 must be conversant in english by 2009 or face suspension
8452862 being a u s based tour and with the majority of our fan base pro am contestants sponsors and participants being english speaking we think it is important for our players to effectively communicate in english
8452863 rafael nadals english is somewhat broken but has improved a lot over the years and he always tries
8452864 without a clear way of recovering the costs and earning a profit and with little leadership on the issue from the federal government no company or organization has offered to fight the political battles necessary to get such a transmission backbone built
8452865 you do not know what you are getting into gemma
8452866 all im trying to tell you is that if you proceed things could get out of hand
8452867 your perception of raven as your mistress is wrong girl she is your goddess you are now hers from this moment you will worship her alone
8452868 consider this i must tell you that the choice you have made is a dangerous one
8452869 proceed with caution for after a certain point your ability to control the situation will evaporate and a force beyond your comprehension will govern matters from then on the dangers are great
8452870 we couldnt believe that we were going to be asked to do this
8452871 i think this is one of those very difficult issues
8452872 it is one of the few big things that we have left here in the atlanta area to go after
8452873 and you have this part of the puzzle you cant do anything about
8452874 the question might be posed better to government entities that are making these cost sharing opportunities available
8452875 we dont need to be playing these games obviously you see in the league that guys are getting hurt you dont need to play obviously with us having a long season last year going to the super bowl playing more games in the preseason and having a risk of injuries is not smart
8452876 since ive been playing i dont think half of us have played that last preseason game
8452877 a lot is said about how preseason doesnt necessarily count but in a sense it does
8452878 not in the matter of wins or losses but in the matter of preparation and its our last game to get preparation its big for us and its another opportunity to gain some consistency within the offensive unit
8452879 what you would like to do is have a chance to play a lot of young guys and let them play and put them in situations and let them fend for themselves
8452880 but obviously when the game is over you want them all standing tall and ready to go the next week too
8452881 theyre just coming in to finish off their preseason and we are going out to do the same
8452882 we are going out to win that is the only difference
8452883 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8452884 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party

8452891 for those who know marathi it is well and good however for those who do not it would be a real problem
8452892 now who would want to read a fast food menu in marathi
8452893 most of the people who come to our shop cannot read english but can manage marathi
8452894 besides we should always be mindful of the soil on which we flourish
8452895 almost everyone understands marathi and if the people feel it is necessary to have the names of shops in marathi then so be it
8452896 the nano project is an unique and innovative initiative which will establish indias position as a small car hub indian industry must be encouraged to make such large investments in order to build the countrys competitiveness as well as support job creation

8452898 pretty much what he said in the letter to the privileges committee
8452899 as youd expect the first thing i did was go away and ring mr peters
8452900 its always seemed to me that somewhere someplace there must have been some kind of contribution but it wasnt clear where
8452901 mr peters of course is on the record that the first he knew of the donation to his legal expenses was july 18
8452902 all new factors obv8iously are new material to be considered
8452903 in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters
8452904 mr peters subsequently met me socially at the karaka yearling sales i believe in early 2006 he thanked me for my assistance
8452905 what else does she know and is not letting on in this sordid affair

8452911 this is john brumbys fallback plan because of his failure to transfer freight to rail as labor promised
8452912 in december 2007 roads minister pallas promised full consultation with local communities and councils about b triples
8452913 john brumby should tell minister pallas to pick up the phone and start making calls instead of traeating local communities and councils like mushrooms
8452914 the challenge weve got is the freight task in victoria is going to more than double by 2030 so theres going to be a lot more goods being moved and weve got to look at the most efficient way of moving them
8452915 with b triples if it means less trucks on the road and fewer trucks in local roads thatd be a good thing
8452916 but before we make any decision in relation to b triples we would consult very widely
8452917 there is now because weve revealed this this was the secret plan they were keeping from communities
8452918 this was the plan that was going to be buried in a transport plan in november no consultation with local communities no consultation with local police no consultation with local safety groups

8452923 i think that van der vaart is going to be the only signing for this season and the reason is very simple the squad is complete
8452924 we have a great team as a result of the effort that has been put into the signings we have made during the last few years that is why we have to be very careful with new signings because we need to bring in someone who is better than the level we have
8452925 robinho continues being a real madrid player and the coach counts on him
8452926 this is a vital year for me because i want to progress and make my dream a reality
8452927 of course i want to go and try and fulfil my potential overseas but first i have to playing regularly and scoring in the a league on a consistent basis
8452928 there are things i need to improve in my game and as a striker finishing is my top priority thats something ill be working extra hard on every day because i know i have to improve
8452929 nikita can be anything he wants now its up to him to go out and live up to his potential actions will speak a lot louder than words
8452930 its nice when people say good things but i know i have a lot to do yet
8452931 i think im progressing well but you never stop and im just still learning the game and trying to improve with every match
8452932 nikita still has a lot of developing to do lets see how he goes this season and then maybe he can look at moving to say a holland france or germany but he has to prove himself first
8452933 i think we played quite well even though it was a huge step up for us
8452934 it was an eye opener for all of us i dont think we were all that bad overall but its obvious that there are different levels in football and australian football isnt at the top
8452935 tactically i thought we played to our strengths and its unfortunate all the criticism graham arnold the coach has taken i personally dont think its been justified hes a great coach who did everything he could we played some nice stuff but just couldnt finish off our chances
8452936 im confident we can make the finals i believe we have a great team and we need to go out and show our quality this season
8452937 hes brought in quality players like amaral and eugene dadi and hes got a great spirit in the dressing room
8452938 a serious effort to reach out to republican voters with a message that this race is not about party its about whos right for idaho
8452939 its the same gimmick minnick pulled in 1996 and the same gimmick larry grant pulled in 2006
8452940 i think well view the super cup as a one off and we want to win it obviously
8452941 but it is also an opportunity to play anderson back from the olympic games nani whos available from suspension and if possible gary neville i think those three will all figure in fridays game
8452942 patrice evra and wayne rooney will also be involved after that it depends whos back from injury if owen hargreaves has maintained his training performances he will play i think well play a strong team but therell certainly be some changes
8452943 danni looked good in training and hell get a chance against manchester united provided that all the paper work is done on time
8452944 arshavin is flying with us to monaco but i havent decided yet if he would play or not
8452945 the moment we got onto the court 23 000 people stood up some moments in your life you cant forget
8452946 you always like to come back to the place where you do well
8452947 its ok its going to be good in two days for sure
8452948 i was thinking more of it than actually feeling the pain so its really not a big deal
8452949 i want to win more grand slams i want to achieve my lifetime goal
8452950 playing in the finals of the u s open that was kind of a turning point in my career last year i started believing more that i can really win
8452951 as a grand slam winner you feel a little relief and you gain much more confidence
8452952 i try to keep my confidence on a high level always be motivated to win there is no lack of motivation
8452953 when gregg and dan got together theres got to be a process there where it works smoothly and a comfort level builds up
8452954 for whatever reason sometimes it just doesnt work the owners got to be comfortable youve got to have a chemistry there and feel good that this fits because they go through so much together
8452955 but greggs going to be gregg you wouldnt want him any other way
8452956 weve got 22 cuts to make on friday my main concern is trying to figure out if im making the right decision on who to cut and who not to cut itll be good to see gregg for a second and say hi but my mind will be on just trying to look at my guys eyes how they look warming up whos ready to play
8452957 thin and of good gentle qualities follows the right path and is of vast knowledge
8452958 i could do this forever this is a routine i have to keep control over and begin to build off
8452959 i got it i just didnt think it was so funny it wasnt clever so please dont insult the collective group as a whole when we all get up and walk out its because we collectively decided we didnt like it
8452960 i want you to understand that that went right past you its gone it went out the door its on the street you ever go outside and see those people laughing for no apparent reason they just got the joke that you let get out of the room
8452961 that was a bad experience i think ill avoid that
8452962 singlehandledly created a comedic genre that is unapologetically christian conservative and crossover
8452963 what am i saying what does this mean is there something to learn from this
8452964 we dont like them we want to throw stuff at them but dang it we gotta listen
8452965 i dont buy into some of these idiosyncrasies of these charismatics but dang it were all on the same journey were all followers of jesus i need you in my tribe
8452966 folks this isnt a curse word there are worse words in the bible than this word
8452967 you know thats fine if you choose to set your parameters there its your ministry your call
8452968 you know maybe its really not our thing but there are a lot of people who would appreciate this and resonate with this
8452969 i may not get it but if it reaches people for christ then ill support it
8452970 there are other seasons out there ive got to support
8452971 if you think an effeminate flight attendant is a stretch then you havent flown
8452972 you christians you know youre not supposed to offend people
8452973 no were not supposed to maliciously offend people were not better than anybody but if the truth offends you thats your problem
8452974 im the truth from which all truth derives if truth exists its because im here

8452977 you are coming to a sad realization cancel or allow
8452978 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve to protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united state
8452979 he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs he has shown a clear grasp of our foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm committment to repair our badly strained military
8452980 in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate obama hit it out of the park with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8452981 barack obama also will not allow the worlds problems to obscure its opportunities everywhere in rich and poor counties alike hardworking people need good jobs secure affordable healthcare food and energy quality education for their children and economically beneficial ways to fight global warming these challenges cry out for american ideas and innovation when barack obama unleashes them america will save lives win new allies open new markets and create new jobs for our people
8452982 the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam he loves our country every bit as much as we all do as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8452983 what ill take back is the tremendous sense of unity we came in here with diverse opinions we all leave here unified as a democratic party determined to elect a democrat president
8452984 as a group we hold some clout as we should
8452985 where were at here for some reason all these dignitaries have to walk right by
8452986 we will once again have a president who respects american and also restore the us position in the world
8452987 i didnt know if i wanted to do that or not
8452988 i thought what have i got to lose its my right to do that as an american citizen
8452989 a lot of the young people with whom im working went double barreled into it the campaign

8452991 a lot of the young people with whom im working went double barreled into it the campaign
8452992 i thought if the young people are seeing something here and these are young kids immersed in catholic theology and social teaching then theres something to this

8453027 any doubts about why russia invaded georgia have now been erased
8453028 by illegally recognising the georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia dmitry medvedev russias president made clear that moscows goal is to redraw the map of europe using force this war was never about south ossetia or georgia
8453029 moscow is using its invasion prepared over years to rebuild its empire seize greater control of europes energy supplies and punish those who believed democracy could flourish on its borders
8453030 moscow has flipped the kosovo precedent on its head where the west acted to prevent ethnic cleansing in georgia ethnic cleansing is being used by russia to consolidate its military annexation
8453031 the next step in russias invasion script of disinformation and annexation is regime change if moscow can oust georgias democratically elected government it can then intimidate other democratic european governments where will this end
8453032 the message is clear russia will do as it pleases
8453033 we want them to go through all past records working backwards until no theft appears
8453034 they will attempt to determine the extent of assets misappropriated and quantify the length of time the misappropriations occurred
8453035 due to violations of policies and procedures or implied entitlement
8453036 hopefully the second part will guide us in the future
8453037 going forward well implement programs or procedures so that this doesnt reoccur
8453038 if i had to come up with a profile of someone who commits white collar crime it would usually be someone college educated who is a pillar of the community involved in civil organizations and has had no involvement with law enforcement
8453039 looking at the fraud triangle opportunity pressure rationalization developed by a psychologist in the 1930s i truly believe you have to have all three to commit a fraud
8453040 thats bigger than the gross domestic product of some small countries and takes in all types of economic crime
8453041 the field of forensic accounting is one of the fastest growing areas in any accounting firm today weve worked on engagements from here to california the caribbean texas and florida
8453042 theres more money out there and with the advent of computers its global now
8453043 when you look at someone whos brazen enough to do a credit card fraud theyre also doing other things and that was our fear
8453044 she was doing everything from setting up fictitious students and refunds to the credit card fraud
8453045 it goes back to my first career in the prosecutors office i wanted to help people
8453046 it has an astronomical effect on families employees the economic system of the country look at enron people lost their pensions their life savings
8453047 i want to interview people in their environment where they work see their lifestyle and be able to look them in the eye and tell if theyre being honest with you
8453048 some things they were looking at in the 1800s are the same today
8453049 just more sophisticated because of computers what you can do and how you can hide it
8453050 if another fraud happens youre going to find it quicker
8453051 we want to minimize effects if something slips through the cracks
8453052 whether its 1 million or 10 000 its the same quality of work and personnel assigned to it
8453053 and people want to know that their tax dollars are not being wasted or misappropriated
8453054 we want them to go through all past records working backwards until no theft appears
8453055 they will attempt to determine the extent of assets misappropriated and quantify the length of time the misappropriations occurred
8453056 due to violations of policies and procedures or implied entitlement

8453216 hacc is an outstanding example of what can be achieved through commonwealth and state governments by working together

8453272 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones

8453279 any doubts about why russia invaded georgia have now been erased
8453280 by illegally recognising the georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia dmitry medvedev russias president made clear that moscows goal is to redraw the map of europe using force this war was never about south ossetia or georgia
8453281 moscow is using its invasion prepared over years to rebuild its empire seize greater control of europes energy supplies and punish those who believed democracy could flourish on its borders
8453282 moscow has flipped the kosovo precedent on its head where the west acted to prevent ethnic cleansing in georgia ethnic cleansing is being used by russia to consolidate its military annexation
8453283 the next step in russias invasion script of disinformation and annexation is regime change if moscow can oust georgias democratically elected government it can then intimidate other democratic european governments where will this end
8453284 the message is clear russia will do as it pleases
8453285 era m s el vicio de tener siempre algo en la mano que de tragarme el humo

8453313 no se ha registrado ratificaci n del convenio 169 por parte de chile en la oit chile no ha presentado los instrumentos de ratificaci n
8453314 todos los convenios de la oit sin excepci n no admiten ninguna reserva o declaraci n interpretativa
8453315 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8453316 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8453317 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
8453318 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
8453319 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
8453320 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia
8453321 no muy presente en los libros pero si muy viva en la memoria oral de nuestro pueblo
8453322 d nde est curalaba d nde se firm el parlamento de quillen en qu lugar naci kilapan son preguntas que intento responder rescatando lugares geogr ficos y efem rides que debieran llenarnos de orgullo como naci n
8453323 como una tremenda ayuda para los estudiantes pero especialmente para aquellos padres que al ser consultados por sus hijos por sus amistades o por la misma escuela no tienen m s que decir que lo que reza la araucana
8453324 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8453325 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8453326 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8453327 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8453328 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
8453329 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
8453330 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
8453331 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8453332 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
8453333 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas

8453336 i notified county animal control about the situation in case we have to decide which horses are adoptable and which ones are not
8453337 people think our place and the one in antelope valley are one and the same
8453338 its a real mess distrust and anger are thick as mosquitoes
8453339 ive gotten calls at my office from people confusing the two sanctuaries
8453340 i tell them i can guarantee that barbaras sanctuary is a good one
8453341 we found horses with open wounds and sores on their legs
8453342 we started getting threats on the telephone from people accusing study finds ayurvedic medicines often contaminated by toxic metals
8453343 i think its picked up in the last couple years were seeing more people come out people are finding it more important to buy local and eat fresh

8453348 romantic friends courted each other flirted were anxious about the beloveds responses and about reciprocity
8453349 the fondest dream of many romantic friends which was not often realized was to establish a home with the beloved
8453350 it does not follow that we should regard such a woman as at all immoral
8453351 i enjoyed every minute of the time and just lived to my fullest capacity
8453352 it makes me feel blue now just to think of those delightful companionable days
8453353 healthy feelings will soon become spent and the capacity for them stunted
8453354 que se encuentran en una base de datos en access especificamente en una consulta
8453355 lack of adequate staffing of nurses and a serious lack of qualified physicians to provide medical care to inmates
8453356 deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of plaintiff and others
8453357 its a finding that they failed to meet the basic essential needs of an inmate
8453358 i went all the way to the top of the career ladder and all i got was this lousy t shirt
8453359 i have a team of experts that has been on site for three days looked at all the data and they have yet to be able to say what they feel is the root cause
8453360 i think theyll be able to narrow the scope into a range of possibilities but i dont think theyll be able to come up with a definitive answer
8453361 i dont know the exact date but positive results for listeria inside a food plant are common
8453362 they review maple leafs records on a regular basis and they review our remedial plans and actions
8453363 i absolutely do not believe that this is a failure of the canadian food safety system or the regulators
8453364 knowing that there is a desire to assign blame i want to reiterate that the buck stops right here
8453365 im not suggesting that that is an option in this case when product is recalled then a range of options can be employed
8453366 disposal and destruction is one of those options product may go to rendering and through rendering then that product can be reworked the listeria would be destroyed and that product could then be used in the production of animal feed provided that the product meets our requirements
8453367 just because its gone out the door you dont know you simply dont know theres no statistical way to test that product adequately
8453368 to test a product you destroy the product to test 100 per cent of the product means you destroy 100 per cent of your product
8453369 we do plan to change the system to make sure that we have greater responsibility on those who ultimately market the product there has to be shared responsibility
8453370 there is no system in the world where every product is inspected all the time thats just not feasible throughout this particular crisis we will evaluate everything weve learned from it and make sure that the changes we are making will prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again

8453374 in toronto for example one of the conference attendees cited the example of an orthodox jewish woman who could not patrol with a male police officer
8453375 what happened is that the police had a consultation with the woman and the rabbi and found some solutions that could work for everyone
8453376 i was struck in the presentation from the people from toronto and vancouver about how much is done to integrate minorities
8453377 in those cities this is a vital necessity for police to do their jobs were not at that point yet in montreal but we will be
8453378 we have to keep working and we have to keep getting better and there are definitely more things to learn
8453379 were sharing our best practices and learning from each other
8453380 most of the people who are members of minority communities are quite young
8453381 its going to take a few years but they will start making their way to the upper management levels
8453382 the next step is to reach out to the communities
8453383 we want people from communities to see what police do to understand why police have special powers so they can see police from a different perspective we want the dialogue to go two ways

8453394 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8453395 i havent seen anything that comes close to the horrendous facts that were presented in this case
8453396 their objectives were not to assist developing countries but as promoted by the trilateral commission to curb world population with a view to serving us strategic and national security interests
8453397 with markets and resources we have a right to make sure that we control them which is logical on the principle that we own the world anyway so of course we have that right

8453406 a hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles
8453407 though 2007 was the sixth and likely the final year of an economic expansion 4 4 million more americans were poor the median income of non elderly households was 1 100 lower and nearly six million more americans were uninsured than in 2001 even though the economy was in recession that year never before on record has poverty been higher and median income for working age households lower at the end of a multi year economic expansion than at the beginning the new data add to the mounting evidence that the gains from the 2001 2007 expansion were concentrated among high income americans
8453408 we have the biggest gap between the rich and everybody else since the great depression
8453409 output per hour or productivity rose 2 5 percent per year during the 2000 to 2007 cycle compared to 2 percent in the 1990s when family incomes fared much better the economy expanded in the 2000s but that growth clearly failed to reach most households a dynamic that implicates growing income inequality the fact that these disappointing income poverty and earnings trends occurred in the context of strong productivity growth is a reminder that in todays economy productivity growth creates only the potential for higher living standards as long as most workers lack the to claim their share of the growth they have helped to generate that potential will not be realized
8453410 the improvement in health care coverage in 2007 was due to more americans obtaining coverage through government health insurance programs principally medicare and medicaid
8453411 the 12 5 percent rate in 2007 compares to 11 3 percent in 2000 it is unprecedented that poverty is higher at this point in an economic growth cycle and the damage from the failure of the economys growth to lift more people out of poverty is huge if the 2007 poverty rate were just the same as in 2000 approximately six million fewer americans would have lived in poverty in 2007 all signs are that the poverty rate will be driven higher in 2008 by a slowing economy and skyrocketing costs for housing energy and food
8453412 the data for 2007 are of particular concern given that the economy is now in a slowdown and poverty is almost certainly higher now and incomes lower than in 2007
8453413 the 2007 levels are likely to constitute a high water mark for the next few years
8453414 when the data become available for 2008 the picture will undoubtedly grow more grim
8453415 average real weekly earnings are down 2 4 percent so far this year according to the bureau of labor statistics
8453416 we will hear a lot this fall from presidential and congressional candidates about their vision for americas economic future a reinvigorated fight against hunger and poverty must be an essential part of this vision

8453442 the emissions trading scheme is nothing more than a tax
8453443 it is effectively a tax on the use and certainly the emissions of carbon and in the end australians all of us are going to pay for it
8453444 it will increase the price of everything from energy to transport and fuel it is likely to see industries and jobs go to other parts of the world
8453445 this is the most significant economic transformation that we will see in our country

8453460 high protein diets in their own right may also damage the kidneys particularly if kidney disease is already present

8453480 shift from full time cfia meat inspection presence to an oversight role allowing industry to implement food safety control programs and to manage key risks
8453481 the announcement of these reallocations has been deferred owing to significant communications risks and to allow for further policy and communications work to be completed
8453482 their unfounded accusations and fear mongering will threaten the well placed confidence canadians have in the safety of canadian products and it will also have negative consequences on exports from our agri business if their lies and rumours are believed
8453483 it was a discussion document as you know certain portions of that were brought forward in the budget and put in to play but the vast majority was up for discussion and has not been implemented
8453484 theyll have a more oversight role within the plant itself i think its a much more pro active role
8453485 its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regime after some years of neglect
8453486 all i can say is that with the new system that has been set up theres always an adjustment phase
8453487 we are conducting this study to show further evidence that patients who stay on treatment achieve long term clinical benefits even after 15 years
8453488 because of the chronic nature of ms it is important for patients to start on an effective therapy as soon as possible to help reduce relapses delay physical disability progression and protect to help prevent future disability
8453489 and i thank you but we have important work to do here tonight i am here first to support barack obama second im here to warm up the crowd for joe biden though as you will soon see he doesnt need any help from me
8453490 that campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming in the end my candidate didnt win but i am really proud of the campaign she ran
8453491 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us
8453492 the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and restore american leadership in the world
8453493 i think keith olbermann has gone too far i think chris matthews has gone too far
8453494 the idea of anyone trying to ban tom brokaw is ludicrous
8453495 they told me technical problems and i have no reason not to believe them
8453496 with encouragement for those working in the field to continue the very important work we do for the defence of privacy and individual dignity in our community
8453497 privacy is integral to our personalities and its essential to our homes our families and our very identity
8453498 these changes have produced important new challenges which the alrc has now placed before the parliament and the community
8453499 i noted of course the responses in the local media which have been overwhelmingly negative but we dont normally in our rule of law country leave it to those who are affected to be judges in their own cause
8453500 normally we lay down the principles either in parliament or in the courts and its preferable that they be laid down in parliament
8453501 mrs roosevelt and her committee produced the universal declaration of human rights
8453502 that started the great moves of the international community towards the statement of the fundamental principle of respecting the privacy of individuals
8453503 not only grappled with the thorny issues but communicated those challenges and opportunities to a wider audience
8453504 justice kirby led the development of the 1980 oecd guidelines on the protection of privacy and the trans border flows of personal data
8453505 those guidelines are still the basis for privacy laws not only in australia but in most developed nations
8453506 justice kirby also chaired the oecd expert group on security of information systems whose work produced the 1992 guidelines on information security
8453507 rick brings a lot to the table there a reason why davey johnson picked him to be one of his coaches on the olympic team because he is that good
8453508 we have been very impressed in all aspects of his work ethic whether he is teaching hitting or whether he is doing infield he is just a baseball rat who loves the game he is highly intelligent and well respected by the players
8453509 jose has got to remain focused to what happens on the baseball field it is certainly inappropriate to engage in any conversation with the fans during a game you need to ignore it and respond in a way that doesnt draw attention to yourself well just continue to work with jose about managing what he says and how he responds it is something we continue to manage
8453510 the fans have a right to act and say things as long as it doesnt infringe on the rights of the other fans
8453511 hopefully it gets to the point in a society where fans dont accept rude behavior
8453512 i was actually in the toilet so i didnt see it
8453513 managers do have to use the restroom and i guess i picked a bad time to be in the restroom i found out about it a half inning later we talked about it briefly theres no sense on commenting on it
8453514 it was probably the right thing to do to avoid confrontation
8453515 i understand who i am and the money that im making
8453516 i understand that im hitting 250 and the fans are expecting a lot more than theyre seeing but the word he said trust me anybody would want to go there
8453517 and there are these giant buildings all over this city washington dc where many of these
8453518 i come here today to release you as my delegates what that means is that both senator obamas name and mine will be put into nomination this afternoon
8453519 if the merger is approved hcf will be financially stronger more efficient and flexible and even better placed to grow at a faster than industry rate said the funds managing director terry smith

8453521 whatever is happening politically the bottom line is tomorrow morning the government is going to have to make a decision about building two power stations which are going to cost upwards of 10 billion
8453522 it doesnt have the money and it is going to come out of schools transport and other infrastructure budgets or alternatively the state will start to go into dangerous levels of debt
8453523 the business community is not only dismayed that it has happened it is confused by how it has happened because anybody who understands government finances and the energy issue thinks there was no alternative to privatisation
8453524 nsw now has a very dangerous situation where it cant invite the private sector to help fund this important infrastructure and it doesnt have the money in the forward estimates of the budget to do it itself
8453525 the defeat of the electricity sale is extremely disappointing and will have serious implications on the development of new transport infrastructure in nsw
8453526 it means that taxpayers money will stay tied up in obsolete coal fired power generators instead of being re invested in critical capacity building urban transport projects such as the m4 east and the proposed metro rail system
8453527 we would urge the liberal party to certainly reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics
8453528 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue
8453529 however as there is already a luxury cars tax there are less administrative and compliance costs in increasing it
8453530 the results vary dramatically across market segments and sales are still higher than the same period in 2006
8453531 all businesses are offering good prospects as we move into full year 2009
8453532 this momentum is broadly spread with only tatts lotteries facing a different environment
8453533 simultaneously the attention directed toward the groups cost of operations is likely to help improve margins further in full year 2009
8453534 they are expected to be in the vicinity of 65 milion

8453548 the 2008 beijing games have put an end once and for all to the notion that these olympics are a force for good
8453549 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
8453550 we believe the games are going to move ahead the agenda of the social and human rights as far as possible the games are going to be a force for good
8453551 barack obama was against the war and he has said that he will bring a responsible and i repeat the word responsible end to the war i think thats very important for america both in terms of the safety of our people in unifrom but also our economy
8453552 i was wounded in vietnam a marine corp infantryman i was not for the war in iraq and for a very simple reason that the war in iraq had nothing to do with sept 11th 2001
8453553 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8453554 i was pushed to the limit the last time i played her she was up 5 1 in third and i had to come back
8453555 i was concerned i was going to get my dress dirty
8453556 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match and be able to win even when you feel tired
8453557 when i got into a dangerous situation so i started moving her around a little bit more in the second set i was able to gain more confidence
8453558 hopefully i can play even better in the next round
8453559 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8453560 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8453561 our million dollar club members are truly the stars of usana so we wanted to give them the star treatment

8453571 we are extremely confident in our ability to further drive sales volume on an international level and in turn yield a significant future return on investment for shareholders
8453572 this quarter is the result of hard work done by our sales team and the resulting growth of distributor relationships worldwide including the success of our livestock tracking system expansion of our uhf rfid and lf products in the tire tag and reader sectors and great strides made by our pneu logic division
8453573 when our customer base surged past one million it became increasingly important to find a server vendor that was able to scale with us
8453574 rackable systems servers are extremely efficient and their unique back to back architecture allowed us to increase our density within our existing data center footprint
8453575 our built to order server designs are ideal for saas leaders like zoho who require component flexibility reliability and best in class density
8453576 with our eco logical server solutions zoho will realize increasing energy and cost savings as they continue to scale within their existing data center environment
8453577 we are thrilled to officially open the doors to the principal child development center a facility that has benefited from the dedication and careful planning of so many
8453578 the center provides a high quality alternative for childcare to our employees with the added convenience of being located literally steps from the office its a tangible benefit for employees that will help them manage work and personal responsibilities
8453579 the early years in a childs life are the foundation for growth and development what and how they learn before they start kindergarten greatly shapes their potential for future success
8453580 the principal is proud to offer this exceptional childcare center to our employees and their families and we look forward to watching the alumni of the principal child development center grow into the leaders of tomorrow
8453581 we are privileged to partner with the principal to open the principal child development center which will offer a wonderful learning environment for young children
8453582 experienced and dedicated teachers will focus on preparing children for success in school and life with an emphasis on the environment health wellness and the world around them working together with the principal financial group we are proud to support the companys working parents and their childrens journeys of growth and learning

8453584 que pena que uribe se defienda con su rabia y no con su inteligencia
8453585 there may be a bit of argy bargy on the way through but i think its time to do this
8453586 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8453587 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8453588 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8453589 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8453590 the real challenge for mr rudd is will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply
8453591 we recognised we were all dealing with similar issues in a lot of areas
8453592 so rather than consistently reinventing the wheel we are talking about what we are doing and opening up our files for peer review
8453593 our main focus is on being relevant to the audience on all platforms people are looking for more than just watching tv shows that are pushed out at them
8453594 the biggest problem we have with user generated content is that what people are saying and doing is great but the quality is so poor we cant use it
8453595 kids will be able to create digital versions of themselves which can play games and do collaborative events all in a 3d environment based on storm hawks
8453596 these days it isnt enough to watch a show you have to be in it
8453597 if we can create content that meets their needs then we remain relevant as a broadcaster
8453598 in asia right now there are some exciting tv prototypes where you move your hand to increase and decrease the volume and you can press in the air to change channels
8453599 we havent put any investment in that yet but seeing the trends it might be worth it down the track we are keen to explore touchscreen technology if we had additional funds that is where we would invest some energy
8453600 actually none of that is true but neither are most of the things mccain says about me
8453601 i hate to subject you to this but youve gotta see this
8453602 john mccain has spent x million in several swing states claiming barack obama said iran is a tiny threat however obama never said that the threat from iran was tiny in and of itself instead what he said was that the threat from iran was tiny when compared to the threat we used to face from the soviet union a country with far more people money and natural resources than iran and also a country that had thousands upon thousands of nuclear warheads pointed at the u s at this time it is believed that iran has no nuclear warheads and is years away from having such capability
8453603 mccain says x obama responds by saying y who knows who is right lets ask two partisan surrogates hacks
8453604 senator mccain a video press release from your campaign blatantly misrepresents your opponents words if you cant tell the truth about what barack obama said why should the american people trust you to tell them the truth about anything else
8453605 senator mccain why are you and your campaign lying to the american people
8453606 dude obama and the truth are totally getting screwed right now can you pass the cornbread john
8453607 mccain ads demonstrably false as to material questions of fact lie smear attack patriotism character assassination slime muck ooze filth rubbish refuse
8453608 mccain is a condescendingly arrogant asshole who actually believes that you are stupid enough to believe this nonsense he puts out
8453609 the mccain campaign has put out another misleading allegation they said but the reality is
8453610 the mccain campaign has put out another misleading allegation they continue to say that obama is against off shore drilling this is not true the question is about a moratorium on more areas to be opened for drilling the reality is that 70 80 of the estimated reserves are in areas that are not included in the moratorium and much of the other oil is in states that have been hostile to the idea of further drilling
8453611 for years republicans idealogical blinders have made them wrong about literally everything saddam hussein troop levels the insurgencys last throes katrina climate change the housing crisis soaring health costs the economy
8453612 if they are going to run the ad they must tear it apart anything else is an in kind campaign contribution
8453613 theyve been trying to get me out of here for a long time now
8453614 we really do appreciate the news helping us out because it definitely wouldnt have gotten done if you guys didnt step in
8453615 it hasnt even been a week and the mailbox is fixed we thank the daily news
8453616 theres a new key inside of it and were delivering the mail today
8453617 that building was contaminated with asbestos they started demolishing this building without notification to area residents weve had our windows shut for a month and a half the only thing this community got was a con job
8453618 the careful planning in connection with the remediation and demolition of the obsolete and antiquated kent ave plant has been ongoing for some time and is being carefully carried out
8453619 we cant afford four more years of failed economic policies
8453620 we provide millions of barrels of oil each month to china and the united states but dont have enough to fill up our own tanks
8453621 the oil industry wants stability and access to oil reserves and therefore an expected victory from the mpla party will be good news for them
8453622 the oil industry is not bound by ethical or moral constraints but by principles of profitability
8453623 all they want is for things to remain as they are
8453624 why should these oil companies want a change in government
8453625 assuming no unrest is associated with the elections the expectation is that the mpla will again dominate parliament and the process will pass peacefully i dont think much will change
8453626 the main driver for investor interest in angola is geological rather than political
8453627 i just hope elections end quickly so that we can all go back to business as usual
8453628 our state is better prepared than it has been before to respond to a major disaster
8453629 but i want to emphasize that our citizens have a personal responsibility
8453630 its still too early to tell exactly what its going to do
8453631 if a tree comes through the roof and buries them underneath there theyre going to be on their own
8453632 the citizens should not be worried about the flooding again
8453633 any doubts about why russia invaded georgia have now been erased
8453634 by illegally recognising the georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia dmitry medvedev russias president made clear that moscows goal is to redraw the map of europe using force this war was never about south ossetia or georgia
8453635 moscow is using its invasion prepared over years to rebuild its empire seize greater control of europes energy supplies and punish those who believed democracy could flourish on its borders
8453636 moscow has flipped the kosovo precedent on its head where the west acted to prevent ethnic cleansing in georgia ethnic cleansing is being used by russia to consolidate its military annexation
8453637 the next step in russias invasion script of disinformation and annexation is regime change if moscow can oust georgias democratically elected government it can then intimidate other democratic european governments where will this end
8453638 the message is clear russia will do as it pleases
8453639 if moscow is trying to overthrow our government using its lethal tools let us resist with democratic tools that have sustained more than 60 years of euro atlantic peace backing georgia with europes political and financial institutions is a powerful response
8453640 de blob was the eye opener for us that we can make cool games and function as a good team the game definitely gave us the opportunity to start our own company
8453641 we always dreamed of designing an rts and when wiiware came out we immediately figured that this was our chance

8453706 widely considered the most versatile shortboard we make full rails allow for floatation in small waves while the swallow tail keeps it solid in overhead surf order it 1 8
8453707 the idea that the cosmos itself undergoes an immense indeed an infinite number of deaths and rebirths it is only in the vedas in which the time scales correspond to those of modern scientific cosmology age is billions of years a millennium before europeans were willing to divest themselves of the biblical idea that the world was a few thousand years old the mayans were thinking of millions and the indians billions
8453708 when i read the bhagavad gita and reflect about how god created this universe everything else seems so superfluous
8453709 the sacred books the vedas claim truth is one but sages call it by different names if only all the rest of the monotheistic book religions had learned that lesson all the horror of historys religious wars could have been avoided which
8453710 going within religion teaches us that it has all the answers
8453711 that was my first part up here too i was promoted to mayor of munchkinland stars live on
8453712 it was a part that took a lot of characterization that you could develop in front of the audience well
8453713 violent facial movements and well mimicked walk like the hunchback of notre dame makes roger s great as the grotesque evildoer
8453714 melodramas are my favorite types of plays because you can ham it up
8453715 i enjoyed that role but the only regret that i have is lack of development of character
8453716 i have worked every theater in the area except the canterbury because their guild of actors rushes every production deleting the quality of each play
8453717 to put it bluntly and shortly lack of trained actors is the major problem there are not just enough good actors amateurs are not coached properly
8453718 the best advantage of playing these theaters is the help it can give you in getting into a good drama college the mention of directors i have worked under can move me ahead in credit hours
8453719 we have developed a method that enables us to visualise fingerprints even after the print itself has been removed
8453720 for the first time we can get prints from people who handled a cartridge before it was fired wiping it down washing it in hot soapy water makes no difference and the heat of the shot helps the process we use
8453721 the procedure works by applying an electric charge to a metal say a gun or bullet which has been coated in a fine conducting powder similar to that used in photocopiers
8453722 even if the fingerprint has been washed off it leaves a slight corrosion on the metal and this attracts the powder when the charge is applied so showing up a residual fingerprint
8453723 the technique works on everything from bullet casings to machine guns even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun
8453724 and at least two people have tackled the question of how the original crew met mike w barr amp vonda mcintyre
8453725 buddens can suck my dick i hated pump it up
8453726 unfortunate events have taken place in orissa in recent days these began with the senseless killing of hindu swami laxmanananda saraswati on august 23 i am disappointed by the false claim that christians have responsibility for this murder and i am saddened by the atrocities being visited on christians in orissa
8453727 all christian villages are empty in kandhamal as christians old and young sick and pregnant mothers are hiding in forests exposed to the non stop monsoon rains without food
8453728 we are all under immense danger and threat from these groups please continue to uphold us in your prayer particularly for the safety of christian brothers and sisters who are now hiding themselves in jungles
8453729 i appeal to the governing authorities in india to intervene to save the lives of the many who are being victimized in the current crisis
8453730 respect for the principle of religious liberty and the sacredness of human life requires nothing less i also appeal to all baptists worldwide to pray gods protection for our brothers and sisters in orissa
8453731 now we have no request except prayer from our baptist world as we do not know how to face tomorrow
8453732 the russian move into georgia has begun a tectonic shift in the mideast region
8453733 it has emboldened syria hezbollah and iran to push harder against israel and the us

8453737 if the election date was extended to the year 2009 we will not see them but at the end of the first three months of next year
8453738 the first postponement of the elections in kirkuk and not linking its cause elections to provincial assemblies and the second to form a committee of the essential components in kirkuk in cooperation with the united nations and the third committee formed an electoral coalition of these ingredients in a balanced manner while stressing the second to ensure fair elections in kirkuk

8453740 the house of representatives agreed before the end of the chapter on the formation of a legislative committee to follow up differences on the law
8453741 we work together a response from the arabs and turkmen and it must be the bulk of our attention is to serve iraq and working on reconstruction and find job opportunities for unemployed sons and improve essential services for citizens

8453753 the moments that distinguish a leader when someone says no and you find an alternative those are the moments when you are called to do something in a way that it has never been done before
8453754 we started creating affordable housing in the middle of a recession
8453755 i think a lot of us as young people became leaders because there were people who thought they were leaders but werent doing their job so we had to step up to the plate and fulfill that role
8453756 a lot of people operate under this notion that you have to be elected serve in some hot position or be appointed by some powerful person the reality is leadership begins where you are
8453757 you have to think back to the sixties where you had sncc and sclc
8453758 the character was totally different of the two civil rights organizations but they had one common goal

8453774 la anunciada intenci n del ejecutivo nacional de eliminar las contratistas que prestan servicios a organismos del estado en modo alguno debe atemorizar a los trabajadores pues lo que busca es acabar con la tercerizaci n

8453833 video is such a useful vehicle because nearly everyone has access to it the technology has advanced so fast that anyone can share video online
8453834 now the public gets to enjoy the breadth of what the university has to offer
8453835 but this is not accurate innocent christians mostly of dalit origin continue to be attacked by communal organizations which are mocking the rule of law governance in orissa state appears to have disintegrated
8453836 some prayer houses have been attacked and vehicles have been burnt
8453837 christians murdered swamiji but the government is lying and giving it a maoist color
8453838 naveen as an individual and police in particular are responsible for this attack orchestrated by the church on hindu dharma
8453839 three adults and one child were reportedly killed in fresh violence in barakhama kandhamal
8453840 but what has taken place has even surpassed what we expected
8453841 this year we have made a number of difficult but prudent business decisions in order to improve the health of starbucks and transform the company for the future
8453842 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8453843 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8453844 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8453845 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8453846 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8453847 so were not reliant totally on our own marketing resources to do that
8453848 over time the subscriber growth will be much more a function of cable and international distribution deals
8453849 al jazeera is a propaganda machine for middle eastern terrorists theyll be welcome in my town when one and all of my friendsa are welcome in mecca and you know how welcome youd be in mecca theyd shoot you i object to al jazeera because they see to it that a lot of bullets get shot at my boys theyre mean to women they beat em and they wont let em go to school or learn anything i dont have a problem with muslims i have a problem with islamists a muslim if they want to build a mosque in this country and worship in it then thats ok with me but an islamist wants to change america to meet their end goals im against that i get my research from life experience
8453850 theyre islamic and there is a separatism between qatar and us i thought it was a good move with city manager mike bestor dis invited them from the barbeque i wouldnt have minded if it had just been a private party but i heard it was to be a public political platform where he would let al jazeera interview family and friends i dont have a beef with muslims i have a beef with extremists the owner of the buffalo rose has a first amendment right to have al jazeera in his private business and i have a first amendment right to be out here protesting that the difference between al qaeda and al jazeera is that al quaeda is military and al jazeera claims to be legitimate but theyre not
8453851 we recognised we were all dealing with similar issues in a lot of areas
8453852 so rather than consistently reinventing the wheel we are talking about what we are doing and opening up our files for peer review
8453853 our main focus is on being relevant to the audience on all platforms people are looking for more than just watching tv shows that are pushed out at them
8453854 the biggest problem we have with user generated content is that what people are saying and doing is great but the quality is so poor we cant use it
8453855 kids will be able to create digital versions of themselves which can play games and do collaborative events all in a 3d environment based on storm hawks
8453856 these days it isnt enough to watch a show you have to be in it
8453857 if we can create content that meets their needs then we remain relevant as a broadcaster
8453858 in asia right now there are some exciting tv prototypes where you move your hand to increase and decrease the volume and you can press in the air to change channels
8453859 we havent put any investment in that yet but seeing the trends it might be worth it down the track we are keen to explore touchscreen technology if we had additional funds that is where we would invest some energy
8453860 these amazing creatures have been found in the thames on a number of occasions in the past 18 months during our regular wildlife monitoring work

8453862 the emissions trading scheme is nothing more than a tax
8453863 it is effectively a tax on the use and certainly the emissions of carbon and in the end australians all of us are going to pay for it
8453864 it will increase the price of everything from energy to transport and fuel it is likely to see industries and jobs go to other parts of the world
8453865 this is the most significant economic transformation that we will see in our country
8453866 there is an enormous amount at stake and mr rudd seems to not think things through
8453867 he mr rudd doesnt seem to appreciate whats at stake here in terms of pensioners families jobs and australian industries
8453868 weve said from day one that this is a very substantial reform
8453869 out there there is a broad understanding of the significance of the reform that were undertaking here
8453870 if the merger is approved hcf will be financially stronger more efficient and flexible and even better placed to grow at a faster than industry rate said the funds managing director terry smith
8453871 hes done a lot for working class people and he has a lot of great foreign policy experience
8453872 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8453873 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8453874 i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8453875 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for president of the united states by acclamation
8453876 i have been asked to inform you that senator obama accepts the nomination
8453877 you want to vote according to what is in your heart i am not going to tell you what to do you have come from different places and made a long journey
8453878 president clinton will lay out the choices that we face on foreign policy
8453879 he will talk about how barack obama has what it takes to be a strong commander in chief
8453880 however as there is already a luxury cars tax there are less administrative and compliance costs in increasing it
8453881 the results vary dramatically across market segments and sales are still higher than the same period in 2006
8453882 toby i will never again put one dime into your pocket you drank the koolaid that is destroying the
8453883 the fact that kucinich can be on oreilly and not get into a shouting match speaks volumes they know
8453884 unbelievable that they give a guy like this a meager six minutes they need to put him on the the cable
8453885 rightwing extremist republicans will be who they are they have so much disdain for women and
8453886 occupation of undetermined length with undetermined costs and undetermined consequences
8453887 whatever is happening politically the bottom line is tomorrow morning the government is going to have to make a decision about building two power stations which are going to cost upwards of 10 billion
8453888 it doesnt have the money and it is going to come out of schools transport and other infrastructure budgets or alternatively the state will start to go into dangerous levels of debt
8453889 the business community is not only dismayed that it has happened it is confused by how it has happened because anybody who understands government finances and the energy issue thinks there was no alternative to privatisation
8453890 nsw now has a very dangerous situation where it cant invite the private sector to help fund this important infrastructure and it doesnt have the money in the forward estimates of the budget to do it itself
8453891 the defeat of the electricity sale is extremely disappointing and will have serious implications on the development of new transport infrastructure in nsw
8453892 it means that taxpayers money will stay tied up in obsolete coal fired power generators instead of being re invested in critical capacity building urban transport projects such as the m4 east and the proposed metro rail system
8453893 we would urge the liberal party to certainly reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics
8453894 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue
8453895 this was one way to provide the money to have reinvested in the states grid to provide certainty of supply
8453896 toby i will never again put one dime into your pocket you drank the koolaid that is destroying the
8453897 the fact that kucinich can be on oreilly and not get into a shouting match speaks volumes they know
8453898 unbelievable that they give a guy like this a meager six minutes they need to put him on the the cable
8453899 rightwing extremist republicans will be who they are they have so much disdain for women and
8453900 you cant tell me that any terrorist is going to make anything out of the fact you issued nsls to at amp t and verizon
8453901 my understanding is their interpretation of scripture is that to immunize would be to show a lack of faith in gods ability to protect them and therefore they choose not to do that
8453902 that is honestly the first time ive been asked that question
8453903 and until then ill be sharing mine with him ill have two more by next year
8453904 it was an honor to receive this last year and its an honor to receive it this year thank you very much
8453905 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8453906 we expect to see this kind of behavior in myanmar not in denver colorado at a national political convention where a reporter is trying to videotape big money donors trying to meet with elected officials
8453907 if i leave georgia the russians will close our airspace and prevent me from returning home
8453908 with encouragement for those working in the field to continue the very important work we do for the defence of privacy and individual dignity in our community
8453909 privacy is integral to our personalities and its essential to our homes our families and our very identity
8453910 these changes have produced important new challenges which the alrc has now placed before the parliament and the community
8453911 i noted of course the responses in the local media which have been overwhelmingly negative but we dont normally in our rule of law country leave it to those who are affected to be judges in their own cause
8453912 normally we lay down the principles either in parliament or in the courts and its preferable that they be laid down in parliament
8453913 mrs roosevelt and her committee produced the universal declaration of human rights
8453914 that started the great moves of the international community towards the statement of the fundamental principle of respecting the privacy of individuals
8453915 not only grappled with the thorny issues but communicated those challenges and opportunities to a wider audience
8453916 justice kirby led the development of the 1980 oecd guidelines on the protection of privacy and the trans border flows of personal data
8453917 those guidelines are still the basis for privacy laws not only in australia but in most developed nations
8453918 justice kirby also chaired the oecd expert group on security of information systems whose work produced the 1992 guidelines on information security
8453919 if theres no grass in the ewes diets and they are being fed grain then farmers need to put calcium supplements out to increase the calcium levels in their diets
8453920 a lack of calcium affects the way their muscles work youll often find them sitting down in the paddock and they find it difficult to walk
8453921 if a ewe is in good enough shape they can recover but the sheep this year are really weak some havent had a decent feed in months
8453922 an injectable form of calcium given to affected sheep should see their condition improve within a couple of hours if the problem is calcium
8453923 pregnancy toxemia is a risk every year but is probably worse this year because of the lack of feed
8453924 this year is such a tough year and theres probably more twins this year because the conditions were a little better when the ewes fell pregnant
8453925 not very many will recover from pregnancy toxaemia its much harder to nurse
8453926 these pamphlets are designed to be a education tool and summary of the groups findings to help people save energy and see what grants are available for renewable energy and sustainable land management
8453927 there is so much information out there on energy savings and renewable energy and its difficult for people to know what options to explore however its all been summarised in this pamphlet
8453928 information is the key were providing people with this information and now its up to them to incorporate changes so the region can transform into a sustainable low carbon economy and community
8453929 it was very well received by all people in attendance especially their the candidates willingness to listen to the community if theyre elected
8453930 we just pulled over and evacuated all the kids as teachers were trained to do that
8453931 theres a flat tyre on the inside of the right hand side
8453932 i dont know if thats whats caused the fire but i suspect it would have been rubbing on the bus floor
8453933 council needs to define what waste is produced inside the shire and what waste comes from outside the shire they should not be arbitrarily charging people without clear guidelines
8453934 we bring scrap metal and redundant electrical equipment to the shire which we disassemble and recycle by selling to foundries to be remelted into new products
8453935 on a whole we produce less than 10 per cent waste of the material that we handle which we send to the tip but waste is produced at our work site not outside the shire
8453936 we pay land rates employ local labour and we all spend our pay in the community
8453937 so if the council decide our waste is from outside the shire they should not discriminate and charge the same rate for everything else produced outside the shire as well including whitegoods plastic bags and mattresses but that might be a little hard to monitor
8453938 identify environmentally and economically sustainable methods for the harvest storage and transport of corn stover that can be used as feed for animals as biomass to generate steam and electricity or as a cellulosic feedstock for biofuel production
8453939 training for a marathon it turns out is an exercise in mind control and reality creation to make it work you have to play all kinds of games to keep yourself engaged and to make yourself believe that you can keep running like telling yourself that you are a strong runner that you love running that you really like those hills

8453972 any doubts about why russia invaded georgia have now been erased
8453973 by illegally recognising the georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia dmitry medvedev russias president made clear that moscows goal is to redraw the map of europe using force this war was never about south ossetia or georgia
8453974 moscow is using its invasion prepared over years to rebuild its empire seize greater control of europes energy supplies and punish those who believed democracy could flourish on its borders
8453975 moscow has flipped the kosovo precedent on its head where the west acted to prevent ethnic cleansing in georgia ethnic cleansing is being used by russia to consolidate its military annexation
8453976 the next step in russias invasion script of disinformation and annexation is regime change if moscow can oust georgias democratically elected government it can then intimidate other democratic european governments where will this end
8453977 the message is clear russia will do as it pleases

8454033 from thursday im an obama person today i cast my vote for hillary clinton as that was the mandate i was given by my state
8454034 she has unified us and now it is up to him to close the deal he has to take her message to the hinterland small towns in alabama he has to carry that message to them he has to use words that talk to us
8454035 my party must win and barack obama shares 98 percent if not 100 percent of the values that i have and that hillary has i think a vote for obama is a vote for hillary and vice versa
8454036 my parents would turn in their graves if i did anything else

8454091 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8454092 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8454093 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8454094 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8454095 pretty much what he said in the letter to the privileges committee
8454096 as youd expect the first thing i did was go away and ring mr peters
8454097 its always seemed to me that somewhere someplace there must have been some kind of contribution but it wasnt clear where
8454098 mr peters of course is on the record that the first he knew of the donation to his legal expenses was july 18
8454099 all new factors obv8iously are new material to be considered
8454100 in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters

8454102 what else does she know and is not letting on in this sordid affair
8454103 sen barack obama has never done anything where he had to make difficult decisions hes never run a city hes never run a state hes never run a government of any kind
8454104 hes never run an agency hes never run a business
8454105 i think i have the same reservations that hillary clinton has during the debate last year when he asked what hed do if an american city was attacked and he said hed check the emergency response system and the democrats all pointed out that was a rather na ve and irresponsible way to approach it
8454106 the democratic party has nominated someone that they believe is not ready to be president of the united states
8454107 nobody cares about what the republicans are doing everybody understands that they are so desperate reaching so far that theyre just off base
8454108 hes not even a viable pit bull as far as going on the attack is concerned because rudy giuliani is really irrelevant
8454109 rudy you need to give it up youre not going to mess up the party because we are so powerful and strong and after hillarys speech last night we can do it we can do it we can do it

8454146 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8454147 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything
8454148 this is the kind of question that i predict and this has nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at five 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent
8454149 acting justly and loving mercy and walking humbly with our god
8454150 one thing thats very important is having some humility in recognizing that just because we think that our intentions are good doesnt always mean that were going to be doing good
8454151 scolari identified two targets when we appointed him as manager one was deco and the other was robinho everyone has seen the impact that deco has had on the premier league
8454152 some naive commentators have a ludicrous idea that theres teams of civil libertarian lawyers on alert who scan the skies for the eff signal and then leap into the eff mobile to do battle the reality may be heroic in its own way but resembles battlefield triage far more than a bloodless inevitable triumph of good over evil
8454153 barack obama will bring down health care costs by 2 500 for the typical family and at long last deliver affordable accessible health care for all americans
8454154 took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and half million falling into poverty and million more losing their health insurance
8454155 because barack made that choice 150 000 more children and parents have health care in illinois he fought to make that happen
8454156 john mccain has served his country with honor but his refusal to change course even in the face of the failed policies of bush cheney is reckless and will not keep us safe
8454157 sen mccain says that american troops should remain in iraq perhaps as long as they have been stationed in korea and japan as if there were no difference in history religion or culture between our friends in asia and those in the middle east
8454158 weve been in south korea weve been in japan for 60 years weve been in south korea for 50 years or so thatd be fine with me as long as americans as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed then its fine with me i hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al qaida is training recruiting and equipping and motivating people every single day
8454159 in the last two years sen obama helped pass the new gi education bill
8454160 sen mccain and the republicans have centered their answer to our vital energy needs on one solution offshore drilling sen mccain calls for it in every speech white house analysts congressional analysts and the oil industry all agree that offshore drilling wont add one drop to our energy pool for at least 10 years will it do any harm the answer is we just dont know and neither does he

8454169 the idea that the cosmos itself undergoes an immense indeed an infinite number of deaths and rebirths it is only in the vedas in which the time scales correspond to those of modern scientific cosmology age is billions of years a millennium before europeans were willing to divest themselves of the biblical idea that the world was a few thousand years old the mayans were thinking of millions and the indians billions
8454170 when i read the bhagavad gita and reflect about how god created this universe everything else seems so superfluous

8454176 one was deco and one was robinho and we have already seen the impact deco has made on the premier league
8454177 i think the squad is strong and capable of competing in all competitions without robinho but with him it is an added dimension
8454178 he doesnt want to join either of them and we are now discussing the next move to see what we do
8454179 because of all the problems there city and the uncertainty surrounding the place he is unsure
8454180 he is speaking with the manager scolari at the moment but he is settled in london
8454181 we cannot know given the state of our current knowledge whether an elixir of extremely long life is possible
8454182 our chances of working toward a 41 seat majority are good
8454183 we have voter registration behind us that blue tide and what were finding is that when candidates are getting out and speaking to voters they are connecting
8454184 on any issue having more than a one vote advantage gives you latitude
8454185 if someone is sick or if someone is having a baby they can be away and we can still get things done
8454186 but now she says we got to throw our support behind obama and people get that

8454199 our relationship with clear channel and wrnx is invaluable in the pioneer valley
8454200 the station provides an outstanding signal with quality broadcasts we are thrilled to continue the partnership as wrnx has treated us very well since becoming the flagship the personal relationships we have built mean so much in making this a successful partnership we look forward to three more years of the very best in college sports broadcasting
8454201 we are very proud of our association with the university of massachusetts and we are excited that we will remain their broadcast partners for the next three years

8454204 the question when looking at emins work is not how to judge it but how to feel it
8454205 i try to write the most embarrassing thing i can think of
8454206 there is no monopoly of common sense on either side of the political fence
8454207 ive been working the obama table at the convention for about three days now and all the work that weve done for so long to encourage turnout seems to be manifesting multifold
8454208 to the audiences surprise michelle obama assumed the stage and announced a guest speaker and introduced joe biden
8454209 the whole experience reminded me about why im here the opportunity to work to make things better is both overwhelming and exciting at the same time
8454210 you never think about something like this when youre actually getting married
8454211 can you imagine walking down the aisle and saying something such as for better or worse oh hold on could we just make that for the next 13 years and then thats me off the hook you have some idea of being together 40 or 50 years having all that time and then maybe one of you drifting away you dont imagine losing your wife so young and in such a dramatic fashion
8454212 i cant believe you even made me cook the christmas lunch
8454213 i know what she was going through and how hard it was
8454214 but it would have been nice if shed acknowledged even just now and then what i was doing and said thanks
8454215 very often the last few days or weeks a couple have together is marred by anger and resentment
8454216 its very hard especially if they are aware that this is the end of their time together and they would like it to be a time just of love and closeness the bereaved partner can subsequently feel devastated by their memories we dont talk about this much but we should because guilt makes these feelings worse so many people have told me of thinking i wish it was over i wish they would just die but its not because they dont love someone they want their suffering to be over its a swift thought but it causes such pain to those who think it
8454217 we fill a unique role in providing support some couples will never have that conversation about dying because that isnt what their relationship is about with them everything is based on the hope of recovery others will want to discuss it to plan the future
8454218 we have to get away from this idea that we should not voice all the fears and resentments that come with some serious illness
8454219 i cannot tell you how p d off i am
8454220 i never thought i would ever be ill like this nor that i would react like this ive always kept myself very fit worked hard for a great life for my family and ill be dead in a year and theyll just get over it and move on
8454221 i know theyre upset by my illness but i cant help feeling it would be easier for them if i just died now how can they carry on going to work and university as if nothing has happened my wife even suggested the other day that doing a bit of gardening might help me feel better what sort of patronising nonsense is that to be saying to somebody wholl soon be dead
8454222 how much more do i have to take because i dont think i can take it much longer if youre going to die do it die
8454223 cancer destroyed my relationship with my beautiful wife im not so bold as to think that talking about it will have a huge impact but im glad if it even helps one or two people going through this we need to talk about this honestly because the worst thing is feeling so alone with these emotions
8454224 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8454225 our customers are looking for the kinds of beauty items that department stores sell but in more convenient locations
8454226 it could be hundreds of thousands of dollars before its over potentially it could be in the low millions we wont know until the coupons come in for processing
8454227 in order to protect our retailers and all of you responsible coupon users all coupons will now be considered invalid copies we are working with all the industry players and word is going out to the retailers not to accept them
8454228 i really felt like a fool and was quite embarrassed when i was scrutinized for attempting to use these coupons this past saturday
8454229 its clear to our knowledge that there were no security features associated with these coupons
8454230 if youre going to do internet coupons you should exercise appropriate controls
8454231 i think the whole coupon trading community ought to be commended
8454232 they immediately recognized there was no security associated with these coupons and starting warning each other
8454233 there are 40 coupons in wide circulation with no controls
8454234 theres a reasonable chance were going to be dealing with this for a couple of years

8454238 why doesnt put on small evening dress shirt matching jeans
8454239 the small evening dress shirt is very sexy because it is suggesting one kind in addition kind of enchanting world but when the official situation puts on it a little to waste again official and between the unofficial clothings boundary is day by day fuzzy the fallow land put on the dress shirt to become the prevailing custom i see some gentlemen to put on the shirt turns on the sleeve cuff the dew that looks like outside the jacket is very good
8454240 but i also saw more young gentlemen treat as them the daily clothing to put on
8454241 this comes from one kind to relax with the self expression demand this act is to let the true thing becomes goes off duty and rest idly the leisure attire becomes more official thus enables the identical clothing to be possible simultaneously to deal with official and the leisure two kind of situations this is also very practical if you have set of very good clothes for instance a dress shirt why didnt compare in the new year put on the past many times

8454244 while merkleys enjoying parties with out of state special interests in denver gordon smith is focused at home out on the campaign trail talking to voters doctors loggers construction workers about the issues that matter most to them
8454245 but now she says we got to throw our support behind obama and people get that
8454246 why should i let up on a opportunity like this
8454247 it is being blocked because we found that some of the comments on the website were insensitive bordering on incitement
8454248 we are governed by the communications and multimedia act 1998 which allows us to take preventive measures and advise our license holders such as isps when a service user may be contravening national laws
8454249 we are not against blogs but we would like to see ethical blogging
8454250 i couldnt be bothered to protest against the move what do you expect me to do do you think they would listen
8454251 we support the open flow of information across the internet and a self regulating environment
8454252 the best way for us to find some amenable middle ground between airing opinions and being partial to community sensitivities we strongly urge the blogosphere to practise a commensurate amount of self moderation

8454260 two thousand more people were expelled but this time not from south ossetia but from georgian villages adjacent to south ossetia
8454261 it looks like the plan is building a barbed wire fence around ossetia and they want adjacent georgian villages with a population of more than 10 000 people they want them out because it probably interferes with their security arrangements
8454262 so far they have deployed 400 personnel and 16 armored vehicles in akhalgori and set up two checkpoints one north of akhalgori and one south
8454263 as yet we do not know whether they have deployed artillery but we know they have deployed short range missiles in south ossetia tochka missiles ss 21 used against gori and poti recently they have put georgia under the permanent military threat of hitting the capital

8454271 the time for change has come and barack obama is the change we need
8454272 for eight years john mccain has fallen in line with every one of george bushs national security decisions and now he offers up four more years of the same failed policies barack obama has proven that he has the judgment to deliver the change we need

8454280 it has beenreported that tanuki fell from the sky using his scrotum as a parachute
8454281 the national convention is an important part of nominating the presidential candidate but my race is right here in indiana
8454282 so somebody like a jill long thompson you would think the democrats would want to showcase as sort of that change that has been the theme of the obama campaign so i dont know why they wouldnt have her up on stage
8454283 i think they looked at the race here in indiana saw that shes down 18 points saw that she doesnt have much of a chance to come back
8454284 that time at the podium is valuable so i dont think they just want to give it away to anyone who doesnt have a shot

8454308 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8454309 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8454310 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8454311 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8454312 the fight song has always been a tradition at arkansas state and that will continue with the exception of one minor change

8454320 people not defining themselves as green doing green things and others that said they were green and drove suvs and had big houses
8454321 that only a small minority of those who want a healthier environment and consider themselves environmentalists engage in environmentally sustainable behavior
8454322 its easier to feel green than to act green schadler writes
8454323 feeling green doesnt cost any time or money or force you to change your habits or accept something new or different
8454324 and asking consumers to spend a premium on a green product is the most hassle filled commitment at all

8454328 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken

8454330 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs

8454333 we heard some interesting things that opened our eyes to how americans are truly thinking about spending their later years

8454427 ive seen how we can make some changes through the appropriations process
8454428 this bill is an attempt for us to address issues you face on a daily basis
8454429 it is difficult to come forward and say you need help but were perfectly set up with people who can counsel and help you
8454430 if you support this bill you need to have folks keep on top of us to make sure this passes
8454431 we want a national standard of excellence and performance for our students
8454432 we are trying to fill in the gaps so there isnt any leakage when we need to come together
8454433 the answer is to have congress put together bills to address how we can give people more choices on energy
8454434 if we do that home by home well start to impact our carbon footprint
8454435 we need to spend time on research for energy thats cleaner
8454436 when we can move big corporations through grassroots well see some big more permanent changes
8454437 a child growing up today needs to learn about their impact on the carbon footprint
8454438 we have to educate children to make better choices than we have
8454439 like other organizations we are feeling the economic pinch this year and are really looking to the community to help make this auction a tremendous success for our students
8454440 we can tell that theres a real economic change this year we dont have as much from merchants
8454441 this auction is important because without it we arent able to keep up with current technology and provide our teachers and students with the exceptional equipment that theyve come to rely on to meet their educational needs

8454444 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8454445 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8454446 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8454447 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8454448 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8454454 as youd expect the first thing i did was go away and ring mr peters
8454455 its always seemed to me that somewhere someplace there must have been some kind of contribution but it wasnt clear where
8454456 mr peters of course is on the record that the first he knew of the donation to his legal expenses was july 18
8454457 all new factors obv8iously are new material to be considered
8454458 in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters
8454459 mr peters subsequently met me socially at the karaka yearling sales i believe in early 2006 he thanked me for my assistance

8454479 it was the fourth game of the preseason and it was coming down to the final cuts
8454480 so i had to go out and show what i have
8454481 the thing about him that i like is hes got a non stop motor
8454482 i can remember two minute drills where hes impressed me there was a game situation and i remember on one drive he couldve had three sacks that just shows that attrition doesnt get to the guy
8454483 you have to keep the motor running at all times
8454484 because when you let it stop the play you let up on could be the one that changes the game for either side i want to be a game changer
8454485 i was trying to get off the ball and get the tackle on his edge a little faster
8454486 its a really good feeling thats hard to describe but once you hit the quarterback its a way to let him know that youre in the game
8454487 we werent happy that collins got hurt but we were happy that we got to the quarterback
8454488 whenever that happens the whole team gets excited and the defensive guys start licking their chops
8454489 i learned the lyrics and their meaning in great detail but the most important thing is how they sound

8454518 america is a world leader in renewable energy and energy efficiency
8454519 these projects are good for business good for the economy good for jobs and they help secure more self sufficient energy resources for our country
8454520 with the introduction of the new regulations the project became economically worthwhile but in addition its necessary
8454521 if electricity prices rise the iecs prices will already meet the cost of solar energy in 2016 thats another reason the project is worthwhile its more than the need to be independent

8454545 it is also the easiest and most sensible way of transporting petroleum products as almost all petroleum storage terminals are located near the tracks
8454546 we should not locate railway stations according to the wishes of politicians they should be at a reasonable distant to cater to the bulk transport requirements of rail

8454574 europes relationship with russia has seldom been more difficult than today but this issue cannot wait for a political solution to the conflict addressing this situation should be a top priority for the eu at next weeks summit
8454575 russia is obligated to ensure the safety and well being of civilians in the areas under its de facto control but civilians are clearly not being protected
8454576 this is why the european union should urgently agree on an international presence to ensure security
8454577 i stood in the street with three neighbors they approached us shooting in the air and said you werent happy with a peaceful life now were going to show you they asked for money but what kind of money do we have then they started beating us with the butts of their guns one neighbor had his collar bone broken as a result of the beating he was taken to the hospital they hit me and another neighbor in the face on the ribs and in the kidney area then they went to the next door house and looted it i saw them take away a fridge clothes and other things they loaded the loot on to a cart and forced me at gunpoint to push it

8454588 its not a decision of anything else but me wanting to play football and whether thats a good decision or not im going to go out and try first to see what i want to do
8454589 it is something he has put an awful lot of time into and we are going to manage it and hope he can manage it and be ready to play
8454590 we are not going to put him on the field if hes not able to go out and perform and he is not going to want to be out there if he doesnt feel like he can perform
8454591 china which has own separatists will be the biggest problem
8454592 the recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia is unacceptable for beijing
8454593 were not going to twist anyones hands to make them support recognition
8454594 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8454595 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8454596 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8454597 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8454598 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8454599 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8454600 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in center and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8454601 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8454602 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8454603 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys
8454604 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8454605 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8454606 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8454607 even though hes scheduled to pitch friday we are evaluating on a day to day basis
8454608 the key is not to let guys play when theyre in a vulnerable state
8454609 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8454610 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8454611 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that is our candidate and he will be our president
8454612 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8454613 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution president of the united states
8454614 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8454615 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8454616 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8454617 and just in case you were wondering i think reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8454618 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8454619 gotta get ready for the real world yeah gotta grow up
8454620 its worth it just to hear you say youre gonna give me everything when im home everything seems to be right
8454621 i dont want your chevrolet just give me some of your love man
8454622 how could they let six million jews and five million other people be murdered like that
8454623 let us not regard truth as the best option let us regard it as the only option
8454624 woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter
8454625 every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low
8454626 behold there are last which shall be first and there are first which shall be last
8454627 no never shake the hand of someone who knows chin na
8454628 all lpga members should be on 5ft 6in to 6ft height slim and preferably look like models
8454629 why dont the women make just as much money as the men
8454630 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8454631 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8454632 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8454633 weve had two powerful women speak back to back on each night michelle obama and hillary clinton
8454634 this has been a joy we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time trying
8454635 we will leave denver united my goal is that we win in november
8454636 hes going to lay out a case for change hes going to set the stakes of this election the risks of continuing down the road were on which is plainly what sen mccain is offering
8454637 the evolution of the cerebral cortex certainly improved the ability of human beings to create and adapt to function in and with groups communities and culture and to respond to pain associated with social interactions
8454638 however the cerebral cortex may also have had an unintended effect of allowing humans to relive re experience and suffer from social pain
8454639 i threw my bullpen session today and i felt sharp my pitches were down herges said
8454640 we are still in this thing center fielder willy taveras said
8454641 in info shared with me from other people they will ask how can you do this how can i not give a guy with his pedigree a fourth start they say that i am giving up on the season how lame is that theres a bigger issue involved you have give him a viable opportunity
8454642 barack obama has already invited a new wave of republican criticism that the white house isnt big enough for his ego with his plans to accept the democratic nomination thursday at invesco field at mile high
8454643 observe a level of decency and decorum demanded by the import of the moment of the presence of the one
8454644 denver democratic presidential candidate barack obamas big speech on thursday night will be delivered from an elaborate columned stage resembling a miniature greek temple
8454645 just obtained the latest counterpunch from american issues project the independent group running the ad about bill ayers that the obama campaign
8454646 on august 28th 76 000 fanatical barack obama supporters will fill the invesco field in denver to join the obama cult of personality and mindlessly chant slogans as they sign the country over to their glorious leader
8454647 there are about 450 air force personnel deployed throughout the meao they are doing raaf and australia proud working long hours often in hot and difficult conditions
8454648 in addition to visiting air crews and flight line staff i met air force people working in operational support and joint roles ranging from air space management intelligence medical logistics administration and security tasks many of our personnel in these positions do not receive a lot of public recognition this visit was a great opportunity to see the valuable work they are performing
8454649 i also acknowledge the extremely important role played by the families and friends of deployed air force personnel back here in australia in many ways they have the hardest task and the support they provide keeps morale up as our people spend months away from home
8454650 i am here first to support barack obama second i am here to warm up the crowd for joe biden
8454651 that makes 2 of us actually that makes 18 million of us
8454652 in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8454653 in barack obama america will have the national security leadership we need my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america
8454654 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8454655 the world has always been more impressed by the power of our example than the example of our power
8454656 now what have the republicans gotten us the biggest income inequality since the 1920s
8454657 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8454658 yes he can but first we have to elect him
8454659 but on the two most important questions of this election how to build the american dream and how to restore americas standing in the world john mccain was wrong
8454660 lets send a simple message to john mccain thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8454661 you can tell he didnt want to be there that hes hurting that he actually gave the first campaign speech of hillary 2012
8454662 michelle um you look angry everytime youre on camera lets at least have a fake smile
8454663 its business for them thats all anyone cares about these days
8454664 i know stephanie and eamon are very disappointed that happened
8454665 were happy if ms gunn wants to come forward and well get something signed
8454666 i queued up for 1 1 2 hours i just wanted to get an autograph in my book
8454667 i dont sell it all i wanted was an autograph
8454668 in light of the fact that the public has been deluged with pro obama pabulum over the course of the last 10 months we felt it was crucial to make sure voters get the whole story and there is no better way to tell a story than to illustrate it with the company you keep
8454669 the fact remains barack obama launched his political career in the house of known terrorists and was helped with the purchase of a home by a now convicted felon this speaks volumes about his lack of judgment vision and experience
8454670 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could
8454671 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8454672 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8454673 we have had a couple of deaths that i know of that are attributable to waiting time
8454674 i would invite dr starkey to make any information that she has available to back up those statements available to me immediately because they are very serious allegations
8454675 im starting to sound like a broken record we have a population growth of around 2 per cent per year yet our emergency department presentations are increasing 10 per cent a year
8454676 in some parts of the state like gold coast like townsville over 30 per cent a year now thats the kind of figures that were having to deal with
8454677 all the hospitals have tried to do a whole range of things for the last couple of years and nothings really worked
8454678 its sort of tinkered around the edges it needs something quite radical to alleviate the situation
8454679 our surgical waiting lists are already unacceptably long and they are actually growing despite doing more surgery so we can not afford to do that
8454680 it is also a waste of taxpayers money when weve got all these surgical facilities and particularly our highly skilled staff sitting by idle simply because there arent the beds to actually care for the patients post surgery
8454681 there are ways in which we are trying to get referrals of patients quickly who have had their surgery or in beds in townsville hospital being referred back to other public hospitals closer to their home
8454682 the local administration is talking to the private hospital to see if theres any further capacity in private beds
8454683 it starts a snowball effect we lost our council back in march and we were told by the government that it wouldnt have any effect on our community
8454684 were looking at august now and were losing our hospital do we look in another six months and lose our high school
8454685 our position on iran will stay the way it is now
8454686 and thats why we need to reduce domestic farm subsidies and take down global trade barriers
8454687 there is no doubt that a guiding hand is needed
8454688 mom today i got to treat all the orphans for lice it was great
8454689 if the votes of illegal workers are counted in union elections unions may have an incentive to encourage illegal aliens to conceal their undocumented status
8454690 every day that goes by is one day less that they have to negotiate
8454691 a measured pace cognisant of the requirements to maintain defence capability
8454692 australia simply cannot justify sustain or afford to continue operating two almost identical air traffic management systems
8454693 airservices and defence have both been discussing an improved national air traffic management system for a decade but defence concerns over loss of its own capability difficulties with funding models and no real incentives for change have precluded real progress
8454694 the existence of two independent air traffic control and airspace management systems driven by different objectives priorities and cultures hampers the delivery of a better product for australia improving the inter operability has the potential to produce savings in the order of 300 million plus
8454695 kami tahu ini akan sulit dari menit pertama mereka bermain baik dan kami tahu bahwa mereka pun bagus dalam serangan balik jadi kami harus bekerja sangat keras sampai penghabisan

8454698 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8454699 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8454700 its horrible how fast your greatest heroes disappear into the ether to mix up the great peace leader with a warmonger thats pathetic
8454701 a great man who should have been president who would have been one of the greatest presidents in history hubert horatio hornblower
8454702 its a shame some low level staffer with little historic knowledge thought it was joe mccarthy not gene it probably made it through spellcheck so he thought it was ok it was spelled right
8454703 he was clearly ahead of his time and should be an inspiration to democrats today
8454704 a catalyst for intellectual growth and inspiration in terms of politics and policies its a vehicle to help challenge the status quo and guide students to find their path into civic affairs and life
8454705 it felt a lot longer than eight minutes every cringe and every gasp of horror made it feel like a lifetime if that is all we have to offer lets hope the rest of the world has popped out down the pub when we take centre stage
8454706 if you find the defendant did not abide by the rules no matter how he might have fought or how many days he spent in the military if he violated the law of war that day you have a duty to find him guilty
8454707 small and medium enterprises in australia have more confidence in alan carpenter and morris iemma than they do in kevin rudds government
8454708 mr swan and mr rudd talked up inflation and talked down the economy and they have undermined confidence and theyve undermined prospects for jobs prospects for business and prosperity
8454709 most businesses are now saying that demand is the issue that the economy is the issue that the current economic conditions are really making their business pretty tough at the moment
8454710 while amp will prudently manage through these market conditions we will also continue to invest where we see potential growth opportunities that position us well over the medium to long term mr dunn said
8454711 m amp a can be legitimate but it would have to be strategically relevant he said
8454712 we saw very strong earnings in our insurance business he said
8454713 businesses that are most impacted by the share market have also held up
8454714 that demonstrates financial strength and the strength of our business model
8454715 we expect margins to contract by two to three per cent per annum over the longer term because of the competitive market in which we operate he said
8454716 market conditions in general are not expected to improve over the balance of the year it said
8454717 at the same time we have suffered from operator reluctance to purchase product ahead of the availability of our new viridian cabinet and gen7 platform and a larger library of content
8454718 sexopolis at the music box henry fonda theater has always been a great event to attend and everybody has a good time we hope you can come this friday plus its free admission for all adult industry performers and this who work behind the camera as well since well be 18 and over many of the performers in the industry who are under 21 that havent been able to attend adult events before will be able to make it to this party and were going party

8454721 hes tough i know he is he tries not to show weakness though i know he has a weak side too but hes not afraid hes a fighter and i can only hope that he uses all his strength to make it through this
8454722 yes but theyre going to move him to his grandmothers house
8454723 oh my god thats awesome when does he move out here

8454735 it is really hard to get your head around the fact that when your child goes on an excursion they need to have a permission slip signed by the parent but the school is within its rights to take a child to the doctor to be put on the pill
8454736 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8454737 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8454738 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8454739 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8454740 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8454756 the disappointing thing for us is that gerrard will have to have a groin operation in the morning
8454757 he will be out for around 10 to 15 days he needs to have the operation because he has been in a lot of pain we knew he had this problem before he went on international duty with england last week for the friendly against the czech republic but yesterday i spoke with the club doctor and with steven and he agreed he needed the operation
8454758 it is not a serious injury ten to 15 days is not long but he needs it

8454811 we want to play with the best and that means qualifying for the group stage
8454812 i felt we were well organised disciplined and focused we were never really under threat
8454813 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday
8454814 we have been struggling for goals but i was never really worried it is difficult when you start the season with a champions league qualifier and an international
8454815 i was here on tuesday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal
8454816 someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time

8454818 we played with belief and competed with them in the first leg we didnt do that here
8454819 we are hurt and disappointed its not how we expect twente to play we must take that anger into saturdays match when the season starts

8454823 de mijn werd in de jaren zestig ontwikkeld als wapen in de koude oorlog
8454824 in 1997 waren er volgens het rapport van de ombudsman 24
8454825 de meest concrete bevestiging voor deze lezing is het verhaal van twee militair getrainde experts op het gebied van gevaarlijke stoffen die tijdens de vuurwerkramp in enschede als hulpverleners in het rampgebied werkten
8454826 we pakken alleen de mensen aan die bewust risicos nemen
8454827 heel mooi meneer en wat een leuke dvd zit erbij

8454829 haha ja maar daar gaat het nou juist om geen doorgetrokken streep betekent dat je in principe mag inhalen maar er stond k een bord inhalen verboden en dan gaat dat bord altijd v r
8454830 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother
8454831 the reason we knew she was pregnant was because when the fossil was found the body was broken
8454832 so there was egg shell on the ground just below the fossil it was falling out of the body
8454833 the paint a thon is always a great way to kick off the season
8454834 most importantly we are able to give back to the community that shows us so much support throughout the year
8454835 theyre giving me the opportunity so im going to take it
8454836 it was definitely part of the decision growing up with those guys and playing baseball with them
8454837 everyone you play is good and youve got to bring your a game every time you play

8454842 id like to welcome the instranet team to salesforce com

8454844 this is an exciting opportunity for all of us at instranet and will be a huge leap forward for the saas market
8454845 we primarily address the enterprise market so we would certainly look for voice enterprise when it comes out
8454846 voice personal certification is for low range stuff and sme equipment
8454847 we have not submitted to the low end one as we felt it was really not worth it
8454848 we are a good fielding side and that is a plus point raina played well but it was disappointing that we both got out together and could not get runs in the end
8454849 you need to put in a more disciplined effort while chasing jayasuriya gave us a good start but we did not back it up thushara has done very well with ball and bat
8454850 we should not take anything from india after winning the toss they put runs on the board we made a few errors on the way
8454851 he loves his country every bit as much as we do
8454852 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
8454853 id put the bgp and dns attacks at least on par with each other
8454854 you really need both protocols and infrastructure for everyday use of the internet but without dns packets can still get from ip address to ip address the converse does not hold my friend dan kaminsky recently made the well known dns cache poisoning trick very easy to pull off so on that aspect i think the dns attack might be a bit more accessible to many people
8454855 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8454856 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8454857 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8454858 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8454859 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8454860 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8454861 on his web site said laura eimiller a spokeswoman for the
8454862 we appreciate hall of fame racing helping us get joey ready for 2009
8454863 they came to us with the idea before the august michigan race and we think its a great win win for all of us
8454864 wait before you go complete an application and get a 50 statement credit
8454865 weve crammed for you get a backpack full of benefits with this credit card
8454866 the group gets 0 5 of purchases made on school branded cards in addition the organization receives 6 a year for every active student account vs 5 for each alumnus account the deal guarantees the michigan alumni association 25 5 million over 11 years
8454867 schools usually approve the contracts and provide access to student information such as e mail addresses and phone numbers some schools also allow on campus hawking of credit cards through t shirt giveaways phone campaigns and in store promotions
8454868 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8454869 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8454870 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8454871 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8454872 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8454873 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8454874 it was about the worst time of day for something like this to happen
8454875 were going to retime so it doesnt load at periods that could impact the system
8454876 a car hitting a phone pole should not take out a control center responsible for thousands of lives
8454877 doled out tens of thousands of dollars to charities among them jeremiah wrights trinity united church of christ obamas church and the arab american action network
8454878 obama ayers funnel funds to jeremiah wright and the arab american network
8454879 zayd named for a fallen black liberation soldier and colleague and malik for malcolm x grounded in identity politics weatherman ideology and rhetoric rebelled against what later came to be known as americas
8454880 the early stages of digging through alleged obama ayers related documents
8454881 but its not really a risk inherent in the single parent family per se you cant assume that every child raised by a single parent is going to have difficulties the majority dont
8454882 their concerns were driven by a lot of cultural assumptions which led them to propose kids are better off in the traditional family
8454883 the evidence on the whole hasnt supported that but the beliefs have persisted in society
8454884 those who grow up with single mothers with adequate socioeconomic resources tend to do well the children of poor single mothers are more at risk
8454885 many of the results that say that kids are at increased risk for negative outcomes have to do with economics
8454886 whats important is not whether they are raised by one or two parents its how good is the relationship with the parent how much support theyre getting from that parent and how harmonious is the environment
8454887 in the case of obama his mother was not particularly well off though she was well resourced intellectually and had been to college and had supportive parents
8454888 we see constantly children of single parent families who thrive because the parents are so devoted because theyre compensating for the absence of the other parent
8454889 that boys in particular need fathers in the way girls need mothers
8454890 i can tell you theres almost no evidence supporting that
8454891 for a variety of reasons children who grow up with single fathers for example are at higher risk than those who grow up with single mothers for either sex
8454892 phelps was born with a gift that his mother nurtured
8454893 a new generation not blinded by the old hates and fears and rivalries
8454894 we stand today at the edge of a new frontier the frontier of the 1960s the frontier of unknown opportunities and perils the frontier of unfulfilled hopes and unfilled threats the new frontier of which i speak is not a set of promises it is a set of challenges
8454895 the decision to move the speech outdoors was brilliant as was obamas this year
8454896 kennedys physical presence was electrifying and so is obamas a big outdoor audience maximizes their presence
8454897 give me your help give me your hand your voice and your vote
8454898 disappointing performance convinced him in the future to increase the amounts of steroids he normally took whenever he faced a stress of giving a major speech or press conference
8454899 what i saw at the time was a young man with good ideas and ideas were what was needed
8454900 hes got to connect with the wal mart voter and the guy who shops at wal mart is used to watching that stadium on sunday
8454901 a stay is necessary in the civil case to preserve the secrecy of the ongoing
8454902 wait a minute so im supposed to tie this in a knot and then attach it to something above me sheesh that sounds exhausting cant i just drink myself to death
8454903 i am here first to support barack obama and second im here to warm up the crowd for joe biden
8454904 she told us in no uncertain terms that she intends to do all she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us actually that makes eighteen million of us
8454905 has convinced him that obama is the right man for the job
8454906 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him and his first presidential decision selecting a running mate he hit it out of the park
8454907 are these the family values the republicans are so proud of
8454908 america can do better than that and barack obama will
8454909 mccain loves this country every bit as much we do
8454910 he still embraces the extreme philosophy his party for more then 25 years
8454911 a philosophy that we never really had a chance to see in action until 2001 then we saw what would happen to america if the policies they had talked about for decades were implemented
8454912 in this case the third time was not the charm
8454913 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8454914 first thing we do after the elections is arrest george bush and the rest of his crime family and charge them with war crimes crimes against humanity breach of the peace treason against the state war profiteering and mass murder lock them up and throw away the key
8454915 hillarys race was the best of times and the worst of times because we saw the dark misogyny of sexist stereotyping women still have more barriers facing them
8454916 stand up against the pervasive bias we saw in the media
8454917 many women ive talked to say they wont vote for him i think there is a lot of hurt they wanted it so bad
8454918 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8454919 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8454920 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8454921 god wants this they dont deserve to be the same as us
8454922 spider man spider man does significantly more than a spider can
8454923 consider is pure joy my brothers whenever you face trials of many kinds because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverence
8454924 blessed is the man who perseveres under trial because when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life that god has promised to those who love him james 1 12

8454931 i hate to admit it but ive kind of been letting things go over the last few years
8454932 i feel some kind of disgusting approval when the scrutinizing staff here actually bother to greet me like my fashions are up to date and
8454933 those are your cute shoes they kinda look orthopedic to me
8454934 its so wonderful to see a family owned business continue to offer great service
8454935 based on current market conditions we are targeting growth in underlying eps earnings per share of at least ten per cent for the 2008 09 financial year
8454936 these projects will more than offset the decline in contribution from mature upstream assets such as the cooper and perth basins
8454937 and yet we still persist in trying to put rational messages into our advertising
8454938 sekalinya anda belajar tentang ragam ukuran kayu bagaimana memakai meteran dan familiar dengan bagaimana kami membangun rumah kami akan memberikan posisi sebagai tukang bingkai kepada anda
8454939 mari ikutlah aku dan kamu akan secara otomatis menjadi penjala manusia
8454940 sebab siapakah di antara kamu yang kalau mau mendirikan sebuah menara tidak duduk dahulu membuat anggaran biayanya kalau kalau cukup uangnya untuk menyelesaikan pekerjaan itu
8454941 janganlah seseorang menjadi tawar hati karena dia hambamu ini akan pergi melawan orang filistin itu

8454946 dan lihat saja kapal kapal walaupun amat besar dan digerakkan oleh angin keras namun dapat dikendalikan oleh kemudi yang amat kecil menurut kehendak juru mudi demikian juga lidah walaupun suatu anggota kecil dari tubuh namun dapat memegahkan perkara perkara yang besar
8454947 karena itu penilik jemaat haruslah seorang yang tak bercacat suami dari satu istri dapat menahan diri bijaksana sopan suka memberi tumpangan cakap mengajar orang bukan peminum bukan pemarah melainkan peramah pendamai bukan hamba uang hendaklah ia juga memunyai nama baik di luar jemaat agar jangan ia digugat orang dan jatuh ke dalam jerat iblis
8454948 dan jadikanlah dirimu sendiri suatu teladan dalam berbuat baik hendaklah engkau jujur dan bersungguh sungguh dalam pengajaranmu sehat dan tidak bercela dalam pemberitaanmu sehingga lawan menjadi malu karena tidak ada hal hal buruk yang dapat mereka sebarkan tentang kita

8454954 fully compliant with all of the contractual obligations of our diverse client base
8454955 we have a great working relationship with both these clients

8454957 you have less financing sources and the sources you do have today are willing to advance less money

8454974 to have students moved outside the airport the city boundaries is a question i cant really answer
8454975 airports in built up suburban areas are common moorabbin bankstown in sydney archerfield in brisbane and parafield in adelaide and they are also big training airports
8454976 mid air collisions are extremely rare theres not an issue of safety
8454977 local residents shouldnt be concerned about these sort of things happening frequently they dont
8454978 i came to work this morning which is option expiry day saying wed be up 40 points and were up 46 at the moment so im happy with that he said
8454979 i think we saw bhp and rio both up in the uk and new york so we had a little bit on our side when we made that forecast and option expiry usually steadies the market anyway
8454980 marks first big tv break was when he appeared in the the farm in 2000 and met director kate woods
8454981 she gave him a key role in her mini series changi in 2001 and since then hes been no stranger to television

8454987 a woman has been badly injured and her husbands panic complicates dans attempts to assess and administer first aid to her
8454988 on arrival in the ed dan pitches in to help while the rest of the all saints team deal with the casualties
8454989 meanwhile erica has been notified of whats happened and races into the ed to ensure her groom is okay its obvious hes not and when dan elects to postpone the wedding the race is on to change his mind about getting married
8454990 will the days events be too difficult for him to overcome or will love prevail
8454991 mes rimes prennent tout leur sens au milieu des nick ta mere
8454992 la france ne doit pas oublier son pass tous les jours trop de droits sont baffou s
8454993 it looked like she had been reaching for them at some point
8454994 i guess when youre watching the sun rise and set you think about things like that
8454995 i love them so much they did the best job they didnt give up
8454996 when they loaded her in the ambulance and the sirens began there was a loud roar of applause that drowned out the siren
8454997 there was prayer lifted up for her all over this county in all the churches
8454998 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8454999 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8455000 we dont need anything of this magnitude to come here
8455001 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8455002 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8455003 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf
8455004 jackson hattiesburg laurel and all areas along the coast its a little mexico
8455005 im not against people trying to make living i have a compassion for those folks but at the same time the taxpayers of mississippi shouldnt be subsidizing a plant that wont even hire their own workers
8455006 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8455007 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken
8455008 i need a job and got kids i heard that they need some help now
8455009 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs
8455010 that doesnt justify but it certainly explains why they might be hiring individuals who show up and say ill work for you
8455011 i havent seen anything that comes close to the horrendous facts that were presented in this case
8455012 and unfortunately while sailing through the air and floating back to earth my sky blue parachute acquired two huge holes causing me to plummet out of freakin control

8455018 its too chunky its not blended properly i cant drink this i would like to return this one and get an avocado shake
8455019 wouldnt it be funny if she never brought me my drink
8455020 no i want to return this mango shake and replace it with an avocado shake
8455021 last year it was a hit but this year its really a hit with gas prices and food going up
8455022 when you want to do things that are above and beyond the basics its fair to charge a fee for those things
8455023 and thats the way were able to provide a lot of things that really add quality and thats something that most parents actually want for their kids
8455024 the best thing for people to do is talk with their school office
8455025 share their situation share their concerns about fees that they might have to pay and see what the opportunities are
8455026 good evening from chicago for the 35th democratic national convention
8455027 and then you had the perception of the democratic convention being manipulated by the lyndon johnson administration to assure the humphrey nomination
8455028 the split within the democratic party was tremendous and that split cost wayne morse his seat in the u s senate that very same year
8455029 the lesson of 1968 was that a lot of people got disillusioned
8455030 but for my children and by grandchildren in the country that i love i want to see the democratic process work and it only works if you have high levels of informed participation
8455031 i love spicy food indian thai ethiopian eritrean and especially senegalese
8455032 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than the example of our power

8455066 this is an issue of having community leaders come to an agreement
8455067 was inspired by partisan divisions inside the broadcasting board of governors
8455068 to resist economic pressures to make additional cuts which could remove it from the top ranks of american journalism
8455069 but as a community voice in the metropolitan region the los angeles times is irreplaceable

8455077 between them theyve put out something like a hundred books and in all those years of chatter all those forests laid to waste neither of them has been able to come up with one lifelike woman character
8455078 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
8455079 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive
8455080 maybe i can get you on charlies show you and one of the patriarchs
8455081 in an even more dire situation than the active army but both have the same symptoms i just have a higher fever
8455082 i have tried to be careful never to say the risen book was irrelevant ive said it was a factor in reopening the discussion
8455083 for information about the rally or what else you can do to fight the genocide see with african union peacekeepers scheduled to leave darfur at the end of this month and the sudanese government mounting a military campaign against helpless and starving darfurians the horrific situation there may very well turn even worse for hundreds of thousands of people
8455084 i couldnt imagine somebody like osama bin laden understanding the joy of channukah
8455085 leftists excoriated susan sontag for implying that the assault was payback for americas crimes

8455090 cause of death lies extremism incompetence corruption murder torture and hypocrisy stupidity and even more lies
8455091 the great red zone that voted for bush is clearly ready for war the decadent left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead and may well mount a fifth column
8455092 based on current market conditions we are targeting growth in underlying eps earnings per share of at least ten per cent for the 2008 09 financial year he said
8455093 these projects will more than offset the decline in contribution from mature upstream assets such as the cooper and perth basins origin managing director grant king said
8455094 it looked like she had been reaching for them at some point
8455095 i guess when youre watching the sun rise and set you think about things like that
8455096 i love them so much they did the best job they didnt give up
8455097 when they loaded her in the ambulance and the sirens began there was a loud roar of applause that drowned out the siren
8455098 sometimes being here at duke because weve been very very successful they expect you to be perfect they dont look at process anymore
8455099 its like what we havent gone to the final four what we didnt win the national title very spoiled and it ruins it a little bit really a lot
8455100 part of that then becomes you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win
8455101 im not saying that it happens all the time but it happens at the end of that spain game most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be thats the way its going to be for the rest of my career here at duke
8455102 each one of the coaches brings such a wealth of knowledge to the table and for a young coach to obviously be around coach k every day is an amazing opportunity
8455103 but to be around some of the other top coaches in the world and be able to pick their brains and learn the game through their eyes is just a wonderful opportunity
8455104 doing those two things at the same time afforded me an amazing opportunity to grow
8455105 throughout this time there have been sometimes articles you should do this you shouldnt
8455106 all of a sudden theres a reason shame on you you dont do that thats wrong the people who wrote about those things they were wrong
8455107 were going to go after it were going to do it and if some student doesnt go to the final four after their four years at duke then thats just too damn bad
8455108 if you dont stay here and you dont know whats going on around here it should be illegal
8455109 i prefer you to stay here if you gonna represent it do it the right way
8455110 he lives there hes a good kid good professional young guy honest decent integrity help the community i support him 100 percent
8455111 this is the industry i want to go into and youve really got to be on your toes because if you make a mistake youre gone because it is such a big production
8455112 you dont realise how stressful it is until you do it yourself
8455113 its business for them thats all anyone cares about these days
8455114 i know stephanie and eamon are very disappointed that happened
8455115 were happy if ms gunn wants to come forward and well get something signed
8455116 i queued up for 1 1 2 hours i just wanted to get an autograph in my book
8455117 i dont sell it all i wanted was an autograph
8455118 i accept that the consequences of this construction is harsh for people in the applicants position
8455119 no one with less than 10ha of land can build
8455120 the ridiculous thing is anyone who lives in 7 b zoning even if their house burnt down wouldnt be able to rebuild
8455121 the thing that annoys me is they told me the lep was a year away a year ago
8455122 were now weighing up our options one option is to rent this house out and pay more rent elsewhere
8455123 we dont want to renovate this house because we want to get rid of it
8455124 i feel responsible to show my colleagues a good time this is my district im the hostess of the week
8455125 so i had to give them a comfortable place to be
8455126 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8455127 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8455128 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8455129 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8455130 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8455131 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8455132 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8455133 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8455134 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8455135 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8455136 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8455137 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8455138 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8455139 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8455140 this is one of my favorite places for a quick lunch in oakland
8455141 once upon a time it would have been my dream come true to sit down and have a big old pile of white powder placed in front of my face
8455142 there is no subtle way to say that i have sinned
8455143 if you eat that whole thing i wont be sexual attracted to you anymore
8455144 i sent my future in laws and relatives to the chateau tivoli to stay for the weekend of my wedding
8455145 our signature scent it smells like forest bubbling water is the sound track in the elevator and the rooms have flat screens amp ample mini bars no coffee machine though which was strange
8455146 oh my gosh you look soooo young and youre married
8455147 stare at you to figure out if you are the only other queer guy in here
8455148 i want to get to know you ill give you the best blow job of your life
8455149 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8455150 but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing
8455151 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8455152 i was deciding do i want to have another baby
8455153 thats when matthew was conceived we had tried for 16 years and no baby so matthew was a big surprise
8455154 self how can i get some froyo on my way home it seems like such a hassle
8455155 hmm when did this little place open frozen yogurt when did that make a come back
8455156 youre on the hot tamale train you sexy frozen yogurt that was hot hot hot woooo
8455157 nicollette sheridan and michael bolton have amicably ended their engagement they appreciate your respect for their privacy in this matter
8455158 michael is a wonderful human being he has brought me a profound love and support he is an amazing sounding board for me
8455159 i am the happiest now ive ever been in my life feeling more grounded than i ever have for me theres only been one person and thats michael
8455160 nicollette and i are very serious about each other i am very committed it is a very special time in my life i have a good feeling about the future
8455161 com os olhos fixos no futuro em nome da uni o com o objetivo da vit ria com f em nosso partido e em nosso pa s vamos declarar com uma s voz aqui e agora que barack obama o nosso candidato e ele ser o nosso presidente
8455162 just so you know we do not have any chocolate milk apple juice root beer or orange pop
8455163 um aspecto essencial da criatividade n o ter medo de fracassar
8455164 as empresas inovadoras n o gastam esfor os para defender o passado
8455165 um executivo que n o sabe gerenciar a inova o incompetente e inadequado para a sua fun o
8455166 h dois tipos de pessoas no mundo os realistas e os sonhadores os realistas sabem onde est o indo os sonhadores j estiveram l
8455167 o s bio n o o homem que d as verdadeiras respostas aquele que faz as verdadeiras perguntas
8455168 imagina o o in cio da cria o n s imaginamos o que desejamos n s seremos o que imaginamos e no final n s criamos o que n s seremos
8455169 inova o atribuir novas capacidades aos recursos pessoas e processos existentes na empresa para gerar riqueza
8455170 para usarem o seu potencial criativo as pessoas precisam de
8455171 the real question is why did we get off this way why did you sanction me in the first place
8455172 youve engaged in supporting terrorists matter of fact you blew up 35 of the kids who went to my alma mater along with another hundred or so people youre a terrorist thats why
8455173 nuclear weapons didnt help you very much in vietnam they didnt help you in iraq and if i ever used them youd blow me away
8455174 why should i be purer than they im getting penalized for this these buys are cutting their own deals
8455175 and they all ended up on the white house lawn
8455176 thats amazing that means your parliament can vote you out of office
8455177 we had a guy like that his name was george washington
8455178 we only kept him for eight years and got rid of him
8455179 rabies has all but been eliminated on this continent and your average house pet whom is only outside when supervised is at virtually no risk of contracting it
8455180 this just seems like a case where the risk of vaccine side effects outweighs the benefit of avoiding rabies
8455181 we searched for a hawaiian actress for two years in the end qorianka got the role because of her acting ability wed rather people walk out of the theatre educated about the overthrow than saying what a terrible actress
8455182 a non hawaiian is trying to interpret in an un hawaiian way what he is supposing has happened
8455183 the young princess must choose between her true love and the responsibility that comes with her title
8455184 the old dark exotic woman falling in love with the rugged white man plot is not only insulting to me as a hawaiian but is an over done disney story not worthy of our princess
8455185 inaccurate and insensitive depiction an extension of the treatment of others towards the host culture
8455186 when someone else tells our stories they cant possibly ever really know where we are coming from
8455187 as far as the girl not being hawaiian well how many hawaiian girls tried out for the part since when does race supersede talent
8455188 we are all the actors the producers the crew everybody working so hard to make this a good film for hawaii
8455189 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8455190 ive lived in a state that has been blighted by racial discrimination
8455191 since then the deep south has been dominated by the republican party using the race issue as a subtle and sometimes overt racial appeal
8455192 im more than happy to see the large number of young people
8455193 barack obama is not an african american nominee he is the democratic nominee for president of the united states
8455194 t hats what this struggle was all about to create one america one house and that is what barack obama represents
8455195 we must make the dream real we must make it real i think it will be real
8455196 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president
8455197 many other people who sign their ballots will make a different choice
8455198 and you are to be given the respect and recognition you have earned as delegates for the democratic party
8455199 it is in our view an important step forward to understanding the properties of the mysterious dark matter
8455200 dark matter makes up five times more matter in the universe than ordinary matter
8455201 this study confirms that we are dealing with a very different kind of matter unlike anything that we are made of and were able to study it in a very powerful collision of two clusters of galaxies
8455202 jackson hattiesburg laurel and all areas along the coast its a little mexico
8455203 im not against people trying to make living i have a compassion for those folks but at the same time the taxpayers of mississippi shouldnt be subsidizing a plant that wont even hire their own workers
8455204 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8455205 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken
8455206 i need a job and got kids i heard that they need some help now
8455207 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs
8455208 that doesnt justify but it certainly explains why they might be hiring individuals who show up and say ill work for you
8455209 it really strengthens my faith and gives hope like a light shining through it also became a way to encourage my neighbors to really trust in the lord jesus
8455210 iba talaga pag nagbabasa ka ng biblia maitatama ang iyong landas its really different when you read the bible it will straighten your ways
8455211 malaking bagay ang biblia kasi ang mga anak ko ay napapalaki ko ng maayos at nakakasama ko sila sa church the bible is very helpful because im able to raise my children properly and we go to church together
8455212 the person that brought it to my attention did ask does that mean if youre mute you cant play golf on the lpga tour
8455213 do you have to pass an exam who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
8455214 what if you have a person who genuinely struggles with learning a new language they have a learning disability
8455215 there are people out there who dont naturally pick up second languages
8455216 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring
8455217 and i have to say that so far my feelings about it are an odd mixture of curiosity and disappointment
8455218 to the last and so far only other web series ive watched
8455219 s biggest problem is its ridiculously short episode length each one running an average of only two minutes roughly only a minute forty five if you dont count the opening credits which run too long considering the length of the episode and does cbs really have to be listed twice
8455220 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8455221 based on current market conditions we are targeting growth in underlying eps earnings per share of at least ten per cent for the 2008 09 financial year he said
8455222 these projects will more than offset the decline in contribution from mature upstream assets such as the cooper and perth basins origin managing director grant king said

8455227 kinsella is a modern day machiavelli the mastermind who ran war rooms for jean chretien and dalton mcguinty hes the ultimate political insider the war room has plenty of fascinating insights and is a must read for political junkies
8455228 warren kinsellas new book is a must read for anyone interested in political campaigning in canada and not just political campaigning i wish id had the chance to read the war room before i became stephen harpers campaign manager it might have saved me from many mistakes and months of painful learning on the job
8455229 the war room is a rich detailed and substantive primer on how to run a winning war room warts pizza boxes smelly couches and all from a master war roomer
8455230 kinsella has crafted a handy little guide for politicos and non politicos alike just keep it away from the kids
8455231 i dont want to say hes a genius but theres valuable insights here
8455232 i just got one copy but i plan to get more
8455233 hes canadas james carville a must read if you really want to win you need this book
8455234 what happens in vegas doesnt have to stay in vegas take some home
8455235 it is said that when he was young the master mage kaile discovered a secret chamber hidden deep within a ruined temple the knowledge he gained from reading the ancient tomes he found inside that chamber is said to have contributed to his exceptional mastery of his craft however no one has ever found the tomes or the chamber
8455236 babylon a d is the sort of thing that would have starred either christopher lambert or rutger hauer in their straight to video heyday years ago
8455237 honey this isnt the nice perfect world we all want to believe it is this is the mission there are people out there that do these things and target people like you if i were you id be panicking right now
8455238 marina folks partying in the mission to be cool and not marina like
8455239 our house was given its name by its former possessor to express a beautiful prospect the air is soft in winter especially the sea breeze is invigorating the oranges are shining golden on the trees and our pine knot fires soar in the chimneys in their light i try to bury my unhappiness
8455240 if slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong
8455241 i thought that the team played better than weve seen them play all pre season
8455242 in the first game we saw a lot of solid offensive plays and the team played tough defense they also were serving very aggressively and were very consistent with their passing
8455243 we saw a lot of what weve been working on in practice come through which is very encouraging overall i thought it was a very good experience for the team and things went very well
8455244 jose has got to remain focused to what happens on the baseball field it is certainly inappropriate to engage in any conversation with the fans during a game you need to ignore it and respond in a way that doesnt draw attention to yourself well just continue to work with jose about managing what he says and how he responds it is something we continue to manage
8455245 the fans have a right to act and say things as long as it doesnt infringe on the rights of the other fans
8455246 hopefully it gets to the point in a society where fans dont accept rude behavior
8455247 i was actually in the toilet so i didnt see it
8455248 managers do have to use the restroom and i guess i picked a bad time to be in the restroom i found out about it a half inning later we talked about it briefly theres no sense on commenting on it
8455249 it was probably the right thing to do to avoid confrontation
8455250 i dont care how much talent a team has if the boys dont think tough practice tough and live tough how can they play tough on saturday
8455251 all across the world in every kind of environment and region known to man increasingly dangerous weather patterns and devastating storms are abruptly putting an end to the long running debate over whether or not climate change is real not only is it real its here and its effects are giving rise to a frighteningly new global phenomenon the man made natural disaster
8455252 the issue of climate change is one that we ignore at our own peril there may still be disputes about exactly how much were contributing to the warming of the earths atmosphere and how much is naturally occurring but what we can be scientifically certain of is that our continued use of fossil fuels is pushing us to a point of no return and unless we free ourselves from a dependence on these fossil fuels and chart a new course on energy in this country we are condemning future generations to global catastrophe
8455253 oh no scientists are all evil wicked men out to make us scared so well all turn communist
8455254 leemans and eickhout 2004 found that adaptive capacity decreases rapidly with an increasing rate of climate change their study finds that five percent of all ecosystems cannot adapt more quickly than 0 1 c per decade over time forests will be among the ecosystems to experience problems first because their ability to migrate to stay within the climate zone they are adapted to is limited if the rate is 0 3 c per decade 15 percent of ecosystems will not be able to adapt if the rate should exceed 0 4 c per decade all ecosystems will be quickly destroyed opportunistic species will dominate and the breakdown of biological material will lead to even greater emissions of co2 this will in turn increase the rate of warming
8455255 another reason for concern regional and global impacts on ecosystems for different levels of climate change
8455256 the breakup is the latest of seven major antarctic ice shelf collapses in the past 30 years after some 400 years of relative stability they include the detachment of a 1 300 square mile chunk from the lars en b ice shelf the disintegration of giant ice shelves in the prince gustav channel and the larsen inlet and the disappearance of ice shelves known as jones larsen a muller and wordie all of them corroborate temperature measurements showing that the western antarctic peninsula now known to insiders as the banana belt is warming up faster than anyplace else on earth
8455257 of course the fact that new undersea volcanoes discovered there
8455258 if you dont know if your ancestor in 3000 bc had cancer there is no way science can say you have cancer now
8455259 whats it going to be like when the temperature starts taking radical swings then ends up extreme in either direction
8455260 everyone below this line will have to be evacuated to the south everyone above this line is already dead people like us in the middle states will have to ride it out the balmy southwestern states might have a chance but new york will have tidal waves which will envelop the northeast
8455261 the breakup is the latest of seven major antarctic ice shelf collapses in the past 30 years after some 400 years of relative stability they include the detachment of a 1 300 square mile chunk from the lars en b ice shelf the disintegration of giant ice shelves in the prince gustav channel and the larsen inlet and the disappearance of ice shelves known as jones larsen a muller and wordie all of them corroborate temperature measurements showing that the western antarctic peninsula now known to insiders as the banana belt is warming up faster than anyplace else on earth
8455262 i just dont think that humans are to blame for the change in our climate
8455263 i dont believe anything our mainstream media and government officials tell us anymore
8455264 the breakup is the latest of seven major antarctic ice shelf collapses in the past 30 years after some 400 years of relative stability they include the detachment of a 1 300 square mile chunk from the lars en b ice shelf the disintegration of giant ice shelves in the prince gustav channel and the larsen inlet and the disappearance of ice shelves known as jones larsen a muller and wordie all of them corroborate temperature measurements showing that the western antarctic peninsula now known to insiders as the banana belt is warming up faster than anyplace else on earth
8455265 the results for temperature and pressure suggest that the arctic may be a temporally leading indicator of greenhouse driven changes despite its large natural variability
8455266 more impressed by the power of the example than the example of our power
8455267 talk about being for it before you were against it
8455268 tonight weve heard obama is the change were looking for obama is the great american story apparently obama is an abtraction
8455269 you talk about that as a dead end silo while selling end to end business processes
8455270 i dont think it will lead to an increase in demand for siebel
8455271 i expect this is a strategy by oracle to keep its siebel customers from looking outside of the barn
8455272 the entire industry has to get better at making money selling on demand thats what were focused on before we scale the business
8455273 im from so you guys will probably notice right away that i have some trouble pronouncing my aaaaahhhhs
8455274 me desilusion mucho cuando algunos l deres pol ticos comenzaron a hablar del boicot de los juegos de pek n el deporte une a la gente acerca a las personas de diferentes religiones culturas y razas
8455275 educan2 a sus ni o as desde el jard n para que sean s per atletas para que en gimnasia sean los uno
8455276 this team will be responsible for meeting the dual objectives of conserving capital and controlling credit losses
8455277 as we move through the bottom of this cycle maintaining capital managing credit and driving revenues are the priorities
8455278 the reality is that this management and this board have failed investors and failed their public mission
8455279 why should we have great confidence that they have finally made the right choice after stumbling
8455280 my replacement phone you sent me last month has stopped working i need a replacement and i cant extend my contract because i may be moving in 9 months so what do you have to show me
8455281 if three years ago someone had said to me on the streets of new york that somebody named barack obama would be our nominee i would have said they were crazy
8455282 i volunteered for him for two years and most of that time i never thought he would win
8455283 this is something people like me have been waiting for for days weeks years
8455284 hes going to the white house hes going to be our next president
8455285 this is one of most significant events in american history
8455286 i think about all the suffering all the pain all the hurt of so many people
8455287 what you see happening here tonight is the down payment of the fulfillment of dream of martin luther king
8455288 just a few short years ago in georgia alabama mississippi many people of color could not even register to vote and now these people are voting for an african american
8455289 it was an amazing moment not for african americans for americans
8455290 i wanted to be on the floor not only as a democrat as an american but clearly as an african american when i was a little girl i never thought id see this day i never thought id see a viable female candidate viable minority candidate get this far
8455291 when we were kids our parents would tell us we could grow up to be anything we wanted to be we giggled because we knew certain doors were closed after this historic year those gates are now wide open so this is an exciting moment for the entire country
8455292 i was deeply moved and i think that youd have to be a curmudgeon if you dont see the historic nature of this evening gop conservative analyst amy holmes said
8455293 it is a milestone that we witnessed here tonight in our countrys ability sometimes to just say you know the past is the past

8455308 i can give you the names and numbers of some people to give to your friend these are people who have experience working with sexual and gender identity issues just because a therapist is gay doesnt mean that theyll be the right therapist for your friend there are also some resources i can give you to give your friend in the meantime heres the number for insert organization they may also have some recommendations

8455312 wonderful blend of information and humor feels like friends a little nerdy a little goofy interesting and loveable
8455313 winning combination of likeable mildly argumentative and almost always interesting personalities often laugh out loud funny
8455314 i play basketball and football i like hanging out with
8455315 what people want and what they say they want are different
8455316 one day theyll charge us for seats after weve already boarded the plane
8455317 you know go ahead and do this it will harm your shareholder value in the long term since business travelers have even less of an incentive to travel now but please dont lie to us about it just say you dont want to give away pretzels anymore
8455318 i have a team of experts that has been on site for three days looked at all the data and they have yet to be able to say what they feel is the root cause
8455319 i think theyll be able to narrow the scope into a range of possibilities but i dont think theyll be able to come up with a definitive answer
8455320 i dont know the exact date but positive results for listeria inside a food plant are common
8455321 they review maple leafs records on a regular basis and they review our remedial plans and actions
8455322 i absolutely do not believe that this is a failure of the canadian food safety system or the regulators
8455323 knowing that there is a desire to assign blame i want to reiterate that the buck stops right here
8455324 im not suggesting that that is an option in this case when product is recalled then a range of options can be employed
8455325 disposal and destruction is one of those options product may go to rendering and through rendering then that product can be reworked the listeria would be destroyed and that product could then be used in the production of animal feed provided that the product meets our requirements
8455326 just because its gone out the door you dont know you simply dont know theres no statistical way to test that product adequately
8455327 to test a product you destroy the product to test 100 per cent of the product means you destroy 100 per cent of your product
8455328 we do plan to change the system to make sure that we have greater responsibility on those who ultimately market the product there has to be shared responsibility
8455329 there is no system in the world where every product is inspected all the time thats just not feasible throughout this particular crisis we will evaluate everything weve learned from it and make sure that the changes we are making will prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again
8455330 i didnt hear cunningham give any kind of order i didnt see him there
8455331 i thought oh no as i put two and two together
8455332 the idea that hes going to be back behind bars for a long time is something were grateful for
8455333 obama is murky enough on iran without mccain stirring more mud into the mix the truth ought to be effective enough when this bubbled up in may even the times was willing to present mccains side fairly
8455334 she was ready and raring to go all the time i could never imagine her being in a bad mood she was incredibly energetic and wild she had a zest for life that i havent seen with anybody else
8455335 we are deeply saddened by the loss of the three members of the campus community
8455336 the timing of this tragedy just as were about to start a new semester hits all of us particularly hard
8455337 offers our deepest and sincerest sympathies to all those who knew attended class or worked with lindsey plank richard putze and daniel myers in particular our thoughts go out to their parents and families during this time of grief
8455338 she was the funny girl everyone always knew her for her humor and her personality she was always smiling and always telling something funny
8455339 she could have had her own food network show she made absolutely awesome meals from scratch it was one of her big passions
8455340 people will always remember her for her humor everyone liked her and she liked everyone
8455341 she was more than willing to talk to anybody and be friends with everybody she was always there for you if you needed somebody to talk to
8455342 no matter how you were feeling if you needed a lift she was the person you went to to get that funny story that exciting happy positive outlook on something if you needed a laugh or some happy thoughts she was that person
8455343 she was an absolute one of a kind spirit her unique energy was always a blessing to be around
8455344 she was an amazing sister that was there whenever i needed her and the hardest worker ive ever met
8455345 i wanted to glide above the smallness of the world like she did she didnt waste time because she was passionate and seemed to choose happiness i want to live more like she did i imagine she left a gaping hole
8455346 sometimes it is very difficult to not think of what you dont want we are wired to think and worry about things that we dont wish to happen this is very detrimental to your success as when you think of anything your subconscious views it as something you would like to have happen we think things into reality if you have kids and you are worrying about them getting abducted every time they go outside or are out of your view dont be surprised if one day your kid gets kidnapped you were silently wishing for it with every little worry prayer worrying about losing your job losing your home losing your car losing your marriage or getting ill actually increases the odds that that in which you are dreading will become reality does this make sense i know its hard some people are oversensitive and show their worry and concern as a sign of love for those they care about my grandma wright was a huge worrier she worried about her health constantly and died relatively young with health issues when i find myself worrying about something i change my focus to working on a solution to the issue i change my state of worry and concern to a state of ingenuity and inventiveness dont worry or bitch about a problem work towards finding a solution for that which mentally ails you knowing that worry is a silent prayer which asks and pleads for that which we dont want is a powerful thing to consider it could profoundly affect your life worry is the law of attraction working against you the more we think about something the greater chance it has to become reality keep that in mind
8455347 he is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
8455348 despite all this evidence their nominee is promising more of the same
8455349 it was absolutely horrendous when we realised what had happened we panicked because we didnt know where the rubbish goes so we had to phone the council to find out
8455350 we were devastated we tried for ages but just couldnt find him eventually we had to give up and go home i cried all the way back
8455351 he had a couple of chips on his shell otherwise he was ok
8455352 we took him to the vet and they gave him a vitamin injection they said it was a miracle i cant thank the guys enough

8455365 perhaps the most troubling is that all of the somali children the minneapolis schools have identified with autism were born here in minneapolis like shaimake the district doesnt have a single child born in somalia who immigrated here receiving special education services for the disorder
8455366 the real impact of hpv vaccination on cervical cancer will not be observable for decades
8455367 ah but i have proof of the causation my sons medical records on the day of his vaccination and his visit to the er with a 105 degree fever show that his encepalopathy was caused by a fever that was in turn caused by his vaccination
8455368 my guess is that you have been told that the possibility that your childs autism was caused by vaccination is not supported by the evidence
8455369 you mean like administering a one size fits all vaccine schedule for 100 of the children in this country and then expecting the same outcome close to 100 of the time
8455370 so by your reasoning why is it that we are told that there is absolutely no way possible that our children had a reaction to a vaccination as you described above that triggered symptoms like autism
8455371 nothing in medicine is 100 every antigen does not elicit the same response every time every vaccinated persons body does not deal with infection the same way every time stress multiple insults exposures etc slapping the 100 expectation on anything is ridiculous
8455372 perhaps the greatest evil of immunization lies in its diversion of public attention from true methods of disease prevention it encourages public authorities to permit all kinds of sanitary defects and social problems to remain undressed particularly in schools it ignores the part played by food and sunlight and many other factors in the maintenance of health it exaggerates the risk of diphtheria and works upon the fear of parents the more it is supported by public authorities the more will its dangers and disadvantages be concealed or denied
8455373 be closed to the public with attendance limited to invited participants
8455374 the purpose of the workgroup meeting is to discuss future granting opportunities and budgetary requirements for the iacc strategic plan for autism spectrum disorder asd research
8455375 do you think such and such money will be enough to do studies on autism
8455376 i would like to see more written about it on this forum and would love to see detailed disclosures of the conflicts of interest of every member of iacc and related proceedings some will have none and others a great many
8455377 given the fact that the department has lost much of the publics trust it would be to your agencys advantge to involve as many people from the activist community as possible in any decision making
8455378 maybe she lifted her arm up but i didnt see it i was so tired and it doesnt mean its bad sportsmanship it was not my intention
8455379 also the receiver should always follow the server when im ready to serve she should be ready to receive those are the rules
8455380 its going to be good in two days im sure
8455381 its like this tournament it supports me in some kind of way
8455382 i dont know how to explain i just play much more confident im enjoying this city so much the crowd when you play here its a different atmosphere and you just have so much fun being on the court
8455383 i dont think you should be coming into a grand slam and playing first matches with the best game youve got
8455384 i want to grow every match playing better and better today i played much better than my first match so its looking good for me
8455385 when they named this 46 1 2 acre corona park which is a public park after me i thought ive got to do something within a year i want to do some initiative something that will make a difference
8455386 believe it or not the hats you see are made from plastic bottles
8455387 we owe him our gratitude we dont owe him our vote we dont owe him our vote the stakes are too high
8455388 do we want somebody who initially fought the gi bill that jim webb and i and others sponsored because he thought well if you give benefits that are too good then maybe we wont have good retention rates
8455389 barack has to go out and talk about his message and his vision for the country and not let the republicans define him for something that hes not
8455390 preventing deforestation promoting afforestation reforestation and stopping peatland destruction are some of the cheapest and most effective ways of reducing global greenhouse gas ghg emissions
8455391 we propose the introduction of market mechanisms that can ensure investment is directed into these areas and a strategy to make this happen as quickly as possible
8455392 the prevention of deforestation and peatland destruction requires no technological development and little capital investment this method of reducing ghg emissions is dramatically cheaper than all other mitigation technologies currently available as low as us 0 1 per tonne of co2
8455393 the economics is startling if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on biofuel subsidies us 15 billion this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change in addition to this the protection of these habitats yields a plethora of valuable eco system services particularly in the poorest countries
8455394 one of the lowest hanging fruits of climate change mitigation
8455395 in the uk we can dramatically increase funding for forest and peatland projects domestically and with key partners especially in southeast asia as well as lobbying at an international level for the right global policies

8455397 denver this weeks democratic convention sought to relaunch barack obamas presidential campaign by doing three things healing the partys internal rift showing voters who obama is and spelling out more clearly what he would do as president especially on the economy

8455400 in these challenging economic times we are placing a stronger focus on highlighting the discounted items in our weekly circular in order to provide more savings to our valued customers
8455401 we were one out from getting directly into the main draw so im glad we were able to take advantage of being wild carded in
8455402 when i was on the team at vanderbilt she would come to hit with us because she was based out of nashville shes a great girl and we have a lot of fun together out on the court
8455403 im still kind of feeling my way through it everybody is so much stronger physically at this level and they have the belief that they belong here which is something i struggle with at times ive really had to improve my level of play and my fitness considerably just to be able to contend
8455404 if i had to do it all over again i would in a second
8455405 i loved the experience of being able to compete on a team and have your friends around once you get on the tour youre by yourself all year and dont have anybody cheering you on
8455406 it takes the pressure off me a little bit because in the worst case scenario i have a degree to fall back on for a lot of these girls out here this is their one shot they can always go back to college afterwards but they wont be able to college tennis and probably wont be able to receive a scholarship
8455407 like an athlete who must be able to withstand the physical challenges of his sport and still thrive you must be an athlete in the game of life daily lifes physical challenges may be less dramatic but the cumulative effects can lead to chronic pain and decreased levels of performance sitting standing carrying a heavy bag driving and working at a computer day after day take a major toll on the body exercising and working your core regularly will improve how you function and minimize long term wear and tear on your body helping you to thrive it will improve your performance in life and in your favorite recreational activities it will also give you a great body pp 9 10

8455410 so can anyone explain to me why the jewish population in the us consistently votes democratic but it is the republican party who always has policies that offer more respect and defense for israel and the jewish people republicans are the ones who have always drawn a line in the sand when it comes to protecting israel where the democrats consistently propose appeasement and more risk for israelis can anyone answer this
8455411 no time for on the job training mccain will bring a lifetime of experience obama will bring a speech that he gave in 2002
8455412 the little boy that would stare into your eyes and laugh when you played with him turned into a boy that wouldnt even respond when you called his name
8455413 the question of a possible link between autism and vaccines simply has not been answered
8455414 well you say there is no proven link between vaccines and autism but can you please name the studies that disprove the link
8455415 a whirlwind of innuendo ensued which caught us all in its wake
8455416 indeed the gmc seemed non plussed by reids intervention the best their spokeswoman could say was we are concerned by these allegations and will be looking at what action if any may be necessary
8455417 in truth they had not a clue where to begin at a dinner i attended on 23 february one medical regulator and i discussed the wakefield case he seemed unsure of how the council could play a useful part in resolving the confusion as we talked over coffee while the other dinner guests were departing he scribbled down some possible lines of investigation and passed me his card suggesting that i contact him directly if anything sprang to mind he seemed keen to pursue wakefield especially given ministerial interest here was professionally led regulation of doctors in action notes exchanged over liqueurs in a beautifully pannelled room of one of medicines most venerable institutions
8455418 doctors say the most common questions from parents concern the idea that autism may be linked to a mercury based preservative called thimerosal that used to be a frequent ingredient in vaccines the preservative has been removed from most childhood shots and recent research has found no link between thimerosal and autism
8455419 97 plus percent of children dont have these kinds of defects and so when you look at what the risk is to children and then what the benefits are the benefits far outweigh the risks that occur
8455420 ninty seven plus percent of children dont have these defects so when you look at what the risk and the benefits to children are and you really weigh the risks then the benefits far outweigh the risks that occur
8455421 ninty seven plus percent of children dont have these defects so when you look at what the risk and the benefits to children are and you really weigh the risks then the benefits far outweigh the risks that occur
8455422 for a political leader to stand up and say we have a national crisis and we are going to help these children are you that guy
8455423 i think the best that we can hope for is a lopsided veto proof majority in congress to get legislation passed and help from dingell on commerce committee and waxman on government oversight committee
8455424 marty can you please not scream your comments hit the old caps lock will you
8455425 to any and all who may feel that way let me make this clear you were never entitled to my childs life and i never had any intention of giving it to you
8455426 that sounds like the client i was talking to you about this morning i will talk to her mom about getting her in to see dr buie
8455427 most any child can have the mumps or even german measles so heres a record of my health from chicken pox to sneezles
8455428 no physician myself included knows everything there is to know about medicine nor even about any small facet of medicine such as pain care medical care is a vast field with vast stores of knowledge which are ever increasing and ever changing any doctor who claims otherwise is a fraud
8455429 we are not studying it because we dont believe it because it hasnt been proven because we are not studying it because we dont believe it
8455430 kelly ann just what did you mean by your comment
8455431 there is quite a lot of evidence of a link between autism and vaccines some of it is direct but anecdotal the many many accounts of parents who witnessed their childrens vaccine reactions
8455432 that the risks of contracting all infectious diseases outweigh the risks of the adverse events
8455433 pssst tell you what guys randy craig ill give you a one time shot to get caught up
8455434 overall the incidence of hz in this cohort therefore is similar to published data for the us population in the prevaccine era
8455435 there were 25 306 adverse events reported 52 7 100 000 doses distributed 5 0 were classified as serious 2 6 100 000 doses distributed adverse events associated with evidence of vaccine strain vzv included meningitis in patients with concurrent herpes zoster
8455436 this vaccine is not yet recommended in france because the length of protection is not known and there is a potential risk of delaying the occurrence of zoster and thus of increasing the risk of post zoster neuralgia
8455437 modeling the effects of varicella vaccination programs on the incidence of chickenpox and shingles
8455438 two possible dangers of an extensive varicella vaccination program are more varicella chickenpox cases in adults when the complication rates are higher and an increase in cases of zoster shingles in the simulations zoster incidence increases in the first three decades after initiation of a vaccination program because people who had varicella in childhood age without boosting but then it decreases thus the simulations validate the second danger of more zoster cases
8455439 universal immunization could also increase the incidence of zoster these problems indeed seem to be emerging in the united states
8455440 one can imagine without too much effort where the campaign to convince people otherwise comes from
8455441 if i had the flu i would be recovered by now
8455442 still autism isnt a health care concern for the u s measles is
8455443 their selective panic over measles and failure to address of autism is more proof of their worthlessness
8455444 he will be president one day if he can keep his zipper zipped
8455445 put a houseplant outside and it will thrive in our humid environment
8455446 the companies believe that this patent cross licensing agreement will substantially benefit customers of consumer products including digital cameras
8455447 both parties will be able to innovate openly with each others technologies enabling new features and products to come to market
8455448 the big difference is that the new system has a lot more memory so what happened yesterday could never happen again
8455449 resulted in the wrong configuration data being loaded onto the switch
8455450 the biggest defense is to have any keys especially those used to authenticate to remote machines and certainly internet facing ones require a passphrase to use
8455451 check your logs especially if you use ssh key based auth to identify accesses from remote machines that have no business accessing you
8455452 what was good for our country was good for general motors and vice versa
8455453 the detroit manufacturers have been dissecting their involvement in nascar with a fervor not seen since well ever
8455454 were in a very early stage of evaluating all of our marketing initiatives and i just cant elaborate
8455455 where we dont see a direct return we arent going to do
8455456 the nascar community is a large part of their customer base theyre not going to leave this market because they sell so many vehicles and they get so much support from race fans

8455477 you always have an eye on the gulf this time of year
8455478 if 72 or 96 hours from now we need to go to another gear well take steps then
8455479 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war

8455488 gerrard will have an operation tomorrow on a groin problem we knew this would happen he had a problem and now he will have an operation and he will be out for 10 or 15 days its not a big problem but he had pain and it was difficult
8455489 the injury wasnt affected by the period of extra time
8455490 he was playing with pain before and he kept going today because he knew he was going to see the surgeon tomorrow its not serious its a minor operation but we needed to do it
8455491 we knew it would be difficult because they played well in the first game and we had to work really hard until the end for me the most positive thing is we played a little bit better against a good team who are sharp now we scored right at the end that showed the team was working really hard
8455492 when you play these kind of games the other team is playing and training just thinking about this game but we have been bringing in players from things like the olympic games and now we can start working as a group phughes699
8455493 venture capital has matured and reached critical mass in some markets and now were seeing explosive growth and opportunities elsewhere
8455494 need home runs such as google and ebay to reach their financial goals but there are not enough high potential ventures to satisfy the large numbers of vc funds
8455495 it is like having a family of children that are still living at home in their 30s
8455496 the traditional vc model and mentality does not effectively accommodate this new buy and hold reality

8455539 i think it is plausible that gustav could intensify further to category 4 strength before hitting the caymans though the most likely intensity is category 2 keep in mind that our skill forecasting intensity changes is poor if you have plans to be on the northern cayman islands cayman brac or little cayman island on friday be prepared to be stuck there for several days as gustav may heavily damage these islands grand cayman island is also at risk the hwrf model predicts gustav will pass over grand cayman on friday afternoon

8455571 i came to work this morning which is option expiry day saying wed be up 40 points and were up 46 at the moment so im happy with that he said
8455572 i think we saw bhp and rio both up in the uk and new york so we had a little bit on our side when we made that forecast and option expiry usually steadies the market anyway
8455573 freudian slip kinda odd that it happened twice tonight and that you seemed so ready to respond to it
8455574 my father my brother and i married that girl jill
8455575 the grand old party is no longer grand its just old
8455576 oh hes actually kind of presidential i can kind of imagine him being president
8455577 the democratic party gave their presidential nomination to barack obama the son of a black man from kenya and a white man from kansas now no matter what your politics that is a moment for the history books
8455578 the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8455579 in this case the third time is not the charm

8455581 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama
8455582 because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8455583 as hillary did last night bill hits the key point at the very start there should be no doubt whatsoever that hes 100 percent behind barack obama
8455584 she should be transferred to bellevue hospital for urgent medical and psychological treatment
8455585 she has been significantly traumatized and she needs immediate help
8455586 any suggestion that the cia would imprison her children is wrong and offensive
8455587 we do know she was at bagram for a long time
8455588 it was a long time according to my client she was there for years and she was held in american custody her treatment was horrendous
8455589 of course they found all this stuff on her it was planted on her she is the ultimate victim of the american dark side
8455590 the violation of the rights of dr siddiqui and her children and countless other missing persons is squarely the responsibility of the government of pakistan there is enough evidence indicating that she was initially picked up by the intelligence agencies in pakistan therefore not only the government of the united states but also the government of pakistan must be made accountable for the crime
8455591 wow how did katie hear c fussing did she really fuss or did katie maybe dream it

8455597 a friend is someone who will bail you out of jail but your best friend is the one sitting next to you saying that was f ing awesome
8455598 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8455599 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8455600 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that michelle obama watching from her seat in the balcony stood and applauded as the former president praised her man and obama delighting the crowd with his appearance on stage praised both clintons as well as his wife for their prime time speeches this week hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8455601 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8455602 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8455603 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8455604 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today

8455611 we are just glad that gfk has finally clarified the position or the non position

8455613 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the whats the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8455614 apple believed the ad was not about technical details or the functionalities or plug ins that were available on the iphone but the varied websites that users could visit and utilise they said all the websites featured in the ad were available on the iphone and were shown as they would be seen by the user they said none of the content in the ad was flash or java based and the ad did not mention any other technical capabilities of the iphone
8455615 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8455616 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone

8455648 first sergeant hatley then made the call to take the detainees to a canal and kill them
8455649 so the patrol went to the canal and first sergeant sergeant first class mayo and i took the detainees out of the back of the bradley lined them up and shot them
8455650 we then pushed the bodies into the canal and left
8455651 its a call to action for these guys to get the right resources and infrastructure in place

8455654 before the data the energy markets were already up because of the storm and so the eia numbers have not made much of an impact although crude inventories being down was a bit of a surprise
8455655 gustav is headed right toward the centre of the gulf of mexico hurricanes taking this route are usually threatening
8455656 between now and the weekend we could see crude prices encounter a fair measure of support as the uncertain path of the storm generates the usual consternation
8455657 we are not convinced that this crisis will be bullish for the energy markets as any punishment meted out by the west will steer well clear of russias energy sector
8455658 what i expect from opec is to keep pumping at the same level after the increase
8455659 thats the sign of a good team one that can win in different ways
8455660 weve been able to win the last couple of weeks by sitting back and swinging the bat today we werent swinging the bats very well so we were able to play a little bit different game and it ended up working out for us
8455661 youve got to make sure to take same approach every pitch every at bat every game and not let the mental errors and mental mistakes get to you
8455662 that says a lot for this team how good we feel were going and how good we can be and how were not going to let up until the season is over
8455663 it stayed in and everything was good and i got an rbi once again weve got to do the little things
8455664 one ball left the infield and they got two runs so what can you do
8455665 i felt like i did pretty well especially against that offense but marquis was on his game so theres not a lot i could do
8455666 la idea era otra cuando me ofrecieron el cargo pero si no hay cambios profundos me vuelvo a tigre
8455667 n stor y cristina debieron saber c mo era massa
8455668 oh the ramones were so much better whats happening to music these days
8455669 oh the days where miley cyrus and fergie roamed those were the good old days
8455670 i would never be able to handle having a boyfriend who is better looking than me i dont know how you do it allison id be careful if i were you
8455671 i cant specifically pick one the best race is one in which your team takes a 15th place car and finds a way to finish fifth
8455672 people with stopwatches timing pit road speeds is a whole lot less accurate than computers
8455673 ive gotten a lot but the best came from my mother treat people the way youd like to be treated
8455674 i let him cross me over going into turn 1 on the last lap
8455675 ten years ago i didnt care about any of that stuff
8455676 today its just cool to slow down and take a break and be aware of things
8455677 a lot of drivers know that but cant say it because people would say theyre not committed what we do in nascar is exceptionally important from a business and professional standpoint but how you interact with your children community family and friends is more important early in my career i was afraid to do anything else besides race because that might mean i wasnt focused ive learned you can do both
8455678 im lucky at 41 to have a team that supports me 100 when the trend is everyone wants a 23 year old
8455679 theres days i dont do as good a job as i need to and i have the confidence to tell these guys that and they dont lose faith
8455680 jeff is obviously a leader that has taken our sport to the level it is from a safety standpoint
8455681 to be regarded as the guy who could win and also had a positive impact in more ways than just on the track
8455682 i try to put forth the effort to make sure thats the legacy and ill put my effort against anyone
8455683 when youre doing it you have to make sure no one is trying harder but theres a time you shouldnt be trying
8455684 it might take a few games to get back in the groove
8455685 spread out the minutes and didnt kill them with practice time
8455686 a lot of our players didnt have any legs they were exhausted
8455687 the one thing coaches and gms complain about during the season is they dont have a lot of practice time with their key players
8455688 for them its a great time to get their key players involved in working well together the coaches probably loved it players probably hated it
8455689 the break was good to diffuse some of the negative team publicity from the incident we had with los angeles
8455690 we had gone through an emotional time for three or four games after that
8455691 especially at the start we didnt want to see their faces for a while and im sure they felt the same way about me
8455692 the basketball at the beginning of the season is a little rougher before people get settled in
8455693 it might take a few games to get back in the groove but i think people are in great shape right now and theyve been playing together a long time
8455694 id vote to have a 10 day break in our season every year just to get our legs back
8455695 i think well view the super cup as a one off and we want to win it obviously
8455696 but it is also an opportunity to play anderson back from the olympic games nani whos available from suspension and if possible gary neville i think those three will all figure in fridays game
8455697 patrice evra and wayne rooney will also be involved after that it depends whos back from injury if owen hargreaves has maintained his training performances he will play i think well play a strong team but therell certainly be some changes
8455698 danni looked good in training and hell get a chance against manchester united provided that all the paper work is done on time
8455699 arshavin is flying with us to monaco but i havent decided yet if he would play or not
8455700 so ar en grande empezar de a poco e ir r pido
8455701 overall we had a good balance with him in the side
8455702 he could have stayed on he was disappointed twente didnt have a go because he always wants to test himself
8455703 i took him off because he has only just come back from the hamstring injury
8455704 we want to play with the best and that means qualifying for the group stage
8455705 i felt we were well organised disciplined and focused we were never really under threat
8455706 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday
8455707 we have been struggling for goals but i was never really worried it is difficult when you start the season with a and an international
8455708 i was here on tuesday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal
8455709 someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time
8455710 fabregas is a big player he makes arsenal tick once you see him on the teamsheet its going to be hard
8455711 we played with belief and competed with them in the first leg
8455712 everyone is excited having the president come to your town is like winning the lotto
8455713 they have the ability to essentially choke off that port
8455714 previous studies have showed that the steep decline begins around five years before death
8455715 what we could see in our data is that these changes occur much earlier than thought
8455716 there is substantial acceleration in cognitive decline many years prior to death among individuals without dementia
8455717 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people
8455718 die polizeidirektion werra mei ner fahndet jetzt mit einem phantombild nach einem der t ter der an den k rperverletzungen in bad sooden allendorf beteiligt war
8455719 we spoke after the game and we cannot be happy with this performance it was a disastrous result
8455720 we know as players we have let ourselves down as well as the manager staff and the fans
8455721 im feeling good about my chances to make the nets roster
8455722 i want everybody to understand why im so proud to have joe biden
8455723 he cumplido un ciclo he jugado tres temporadas en el real madrid he dado el m ximo de m he hecho goles he ganado dos ligas que no es f cil creo que mi etapa en el real madrid ha llegado al final espero que los directivos lleguen a un acuerdo con el chelsea para solventar mi situaci n lo m s r pido posible

8455726 its a tight race something we did not see three or four months ago when the liberals had a lead of about five to eight percent

8455728 a true friend never gets in your way unless you happen to be going down
8455729 be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind dont matter and those who matter dont mind

8455731 i believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge myth is more potent than history dreams are more powerful than facts hope always triumphs over experience laughter is the cure for grief love is stronger than death
8455732 you know youre in love when you cant fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams

8455915 foreign police officers are formally provided policing status if they are to be exercising policing powers in canada
8455916 troopers were involved in both stops of the motorist in question
8455917 texas state troopers were engaged in direct policing contrary to rcmp policy
8455918 we all know that a police officer from outside the country doesnt have the powers of a peace officer here in b c
8455919 we had concerns about what are texas rangers doing stopping cars and engaging in active law enforcement in canada
8455920 unfortunately though the commission substantiated a lot of our complaint it didnt go that far as to say its bad policy for the rcmp to use foreign officers to enforce the law in canada

8455922 please use the map below to identify locations important to you
8455923 i accept that and i move forward with barack obama
8455924 if republican sen john mccain is president the next eight years definitely the supreme court could shift again and not in our favor as young women
8455925 i definitely wish that you know on womens equality day we could be like rah rah go hillary clinton but that didnt happen
8455926 and so i accept that and i move forward with barack obama because looking at the two records on womens rights and just all the issues i care about there is just no comparison between mccain and obama
8455927 i understand how many women feel i am devastated to this day especially today being the 88th anniversary of womens right to vote i would love for that nominee to be hillary clinton
8455928 but i have to swallow that pride and make the decision that is best for womens policies
8455929 you cannot vote for john mccain because he doesnt stand for the same things she stood for
8455930 i think it is irresponsible to vote any other way ok i mean stop acting like petty children ok it is bigger than that yes i would have loved to have hillary to get the nomination we need to look at the big picture and look at what is important than our own personal issues
8455931 i got very angry at the way hillary was treated in the press and it made me feel like i needed to strike out for women and vote for hillary
8455932 yeah i mean this is a big moment this is history theres no doubt i have been a barack supporter since 2006 but ive always been amazed to see hillary do what she has done
8455933 i think hillary clintons candidacy and especially going as far as she has has really opened a lot of doors and minds to the possibility of a female president

8455963 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american ream and restore americas leadership in the world
8455964 everything i have learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8455965 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that

8455991 talk about being for it before he was against it
8455992 hes a special talent hes not as fit as id like him to be but considering he had chicken pox three or four weeks ago he was sensational
8455993 hes been a bit frustrated because hes not been in the fold

8455998 i dont mean to be flippant but a crisis is a terrible thing to waste
8455999 youve suffered the pain now use it as a reason to make some changes youre at a fork in the road quite frankly a lot of jurisdictions are
8456000 this isnt bad news for us it means we will see further closures in our competing regions greater supply reductions greater opportunities in a number of respects
8456001 depending on the level of wealth you want to create i would suggest you want to grow more trees
8456002 some of them will better protect the endangered acadian forest and others will drive it to the brink of extinction new brunswicks forest is one of the most endangered in the country the question is which will they choose
8456003 this really is a sacred trust in terms of the governments responsibility towards the crown lands the public forest
8456004 they need to hold public hearings not just information sessions
8456005 these comparisons are totally unacceptable and take credibility away from the very real objections made about these cuts
8456006 civilized political discourse as canadians gear up for what is expected to be a fall election
8456007 the comparison of canadas prime minister to nazi leader adolf hitler is obscene and offensive
8456008 such statements trivialize the holocaust and inject ugly rhetoric in what ought to be reasoned debate on real and pressing political issues
8456009 we must wonder about the sincerity of a government that recognizes the people of quebec as a nation when it does not hesitate to cut into the very heart of its existence culture
8456010 in addition to ensuring the financial stability of dozens of organizations across canada the financial support of government facilitates the collection of private donations which in turn can promote production here and abroad
8456011 based on current market conditions we are targeting growth in underlying eps earnings per share of at least ten per cent for the 2008 09 financial year he said
8456012 these projects will more than offset the decline in contribution from mature upstream assets such as the cooper and perth basins origin managing director grant king said
8456013 we got a lot accomplished we feel good about the plan and look forward to playing on saturday
8456014 he did a great job all week he certainly is continuing to do so in several of the periods we put qb jordan jefferson in and he gave them a simulation of that quarterback style
8456015 neither one of them hatch or lee know whos going to start and the third one jefferson knows hes going to play
8456016 both hatch and lee of them split reps with the first team today and both of them practiced pretty well
8456017 i think the veteran offensive line coupled with the veteran receivers and some of the things were trying to do will take a little bit of pressure off that position
8456018 its an advantage to the quarterbacks when everybody knows what to do
8456019 i have a strong suspicion that well be ready to play and be very competitive
8456020 i think in every opener that ive been around you make mistakes and i think there will be mistakes made i dont think anybody even the veterans will play perfect but i think well play well and i think it will be an exciting game
8456021 it was a nice wednesday practice we got a lot accomplished we feel good about the plan and look forward to saturday the possibility of the upcoming storm i dont quite know how to deal with it what my experience tells me is that i dont know i will take the governors lead the chancellors lead the lsu system presidents lead and then the athletic directors lead in the meantime were planning to play the appalachian st mountaineers as scheduled
8456022 i dont know if id quite say that i think last years season opener may have been one of the healthiest i just think were fortunate moving our final scrimmage to 11 days out has made a difference overall
8456023 hes hybrid because hes big but hes a safety athletic cat quick hes going to be a big player wherever hes at
8456024 no question weve done that a little bit more in special teams this year of course hell play any number of spots in the secondary
8456025 it will really be more of tomorrow when well have that conversation in earnest its gotten on my radar screen to be honest and i certainly hope like the rest of the country that it stays out of the gulf and something happens to keep it away but we have a contingency plan to ready as best we can
8456026 i think the veteran offensive line coupled with the veteran receivers and some of the things were trying to do will take a little bit of pressure of that position its an advantage to the quarterbacks when everybody knows what to do
8456027 there have always been more drops than i would like to see during todays practice i think we dropped two balls and there was a lot of very crisp playing i think wr brandon lafell had a nice day a couple of other guys had some good plays so it was a pretty good practice
8456028 well its always a matter of postgame we address it as best we can pregame weve done that well in the last three scrimmages that we had during the preseason i felt like we focused again on those aspects its when a guy gets in the game that it becomes self interpretation
8456029 i dont think so i think hell play if his health continues to improve i dont know that hell start
8456030 i watched the game and i was impressed with appalachian state i watched michigan and for all of the reasons you might say a team had problems in an opener they did but they played hard they blocked them very well and they played very competitively they made plays and appalachian state beat them to me i have to give credit where credit is due and appalachian state went in there and they beat a quality michigan team
8456031 i feel pretty good i felt like our special teams took a real positive step in the last 10 days i feel relatively comfortable with our special teams units
8456032 theyre a zone dog sometimes they blitz some times theyre a pretty conventional front they dont do a lot but they do it very very well theyre pretty well coached they stunt enough to make a mess of a play and know how to call it i think theyre a very very capable group
8456033 its the kind of thing where youre going to pressure the quarterback and come after him and you hope you can get to him before he can get out that style of athlete is pretty exciting it challenges your rush lanes and it makes you responsible to where everyone else of the field is
8456034 i have a strong suspicion that well be ready to play and be very competitive i think in every opener that ive been around you make mistakes and i think there will be mistakes made i dont think anybody even the veterans will play perfect but i think well play well and i think it will be an exciting game
8456035 the good news is that both guys who will play the majority of the game have both watched it so there wont be any new view its going to be them taking the snap all they need to do is play quarterback just make the plays that the play calls for and be the quarterback for our team theyll be fine

8456040 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8456041 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8456042 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8456043 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8456044 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8456045 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8456046 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8456047 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8456048 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8456049 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8456050 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8456051 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8456052 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

8456104 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8456105 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno

8456110 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8456111 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8456112 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8456113 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8456114 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8456115 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8456116 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8456117 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8456118 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8456119 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8456120 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8456121 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8456122 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8456123 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8456124 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8456125 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8456126 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8456127 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8456128 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8456129 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8456130 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8456131 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8456132 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8456133 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8456134 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8456135 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8456136 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8456137 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8456138 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8456139 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8456140 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8456141 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8456142 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8456143 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8456144 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8456145 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8456146 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8456147 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8456148 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8456149 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8456150 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8456151 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8456152 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8456153 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8456154 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8456155 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8456156 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8456157 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8456158 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8456159 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8456160 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8456161 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8456162 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8456163 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8456164 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8456165 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8456166 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8456167 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8456168 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

8456192 en primer lugar yo no conozco detalles de la denuncia dada por el abogado le n rold s aguilera espero leerla para poder comentar puntualmente pero en t rminos generales estimo que lo que est haciendo le n rold s es un esc ndalo may sculo sin mayores argumentos es hacer una suerte de tormenta en un vaso de agua no creo que se deba aclarar absolutamente todo o que haya que transparentar todo es algo relativamente f cil en la asamblea constituyente de montecristi a diferencia del texto de 1998 realizada en sangolqu est absolutamente todo documentado y todo es absolutamente transparente
8456193 s he encontrado algunos cambios y los he hecho p blicos en su momento dado siempre ech de menos un art culo en el que se constitu a un consejo ciudadano de visi n estrat gica que se lo resumi en un consejo ciudadano de plural
8456194 ah se cometieron algunos errores de buena fe e incluir a que la velocidad con la que se aprobaron los textos y se cometieron esos errores es por eso que yo me separ de la presidencia de la asamblea porque yo prefer a hacer las cosas m s calmadas y con m s tiempo sin embargo los errores que se presentan son corregibles no son sustanciales
8456195 adicionalmente se les dio otra tarea que se le introdujo en el reglamento oficial el 10 de julio la que consist a en hacer una serie de propuestas concretas y que posteriormente estuvieron consideradas en el pleno de la asamblea y si la memoria no me falla de las 15 propuestas presentadas por la comisi n redactora 6 de ellas fueron aceptadas entonces yo no creo que haya nada raro ac y lamento que mi amigo el abogado rold s se haya dedicado simplemente a ver las ramas

8456200 you know maybe someone to work with the pitchers or the outfielders or the hitters
8456201 i meant me after all i did coach you and your brother for about 15 or 20 years
8456202 i was looking for coaches who could relate a little closer to the players
8456203 hey ive forgotten more about baseball than youll ever know
8456204 i dont need a guy who might say yeah that ken griffey kid is a good lookin ballplayer and be talking about ken griffey sr
8456205 but hell never be able to hit that varsity pitching as a freshman
8456206 mikes father told me hed never be able to hit this pitching thats the last time ill listen to him
8456207 so thats the thanks i get for hitting you thousands of ground balls when you were a kid by the way i had a lot of explaining to do to your mom when that bad hop caught you in the eye and left you with a nasty shiner and for throwing you batting practice until i thought my arm was going to fall off
8456208 we played baseball in the park until it was too dark to see the ball anymore then played just a little longer

8456213 to paraphrase mae west sometimes a vacation is just a vacation hes just on vacation
8456214 ive seen how we can make some changes through the appropriations process
8456215 this bill is an attempt for us to address issues you face on a daily basis
8456216 it is difficult to come forward and say you need help but were perfectly set up with people who can counsel and help you
8456217 if you support this bill you need to have folks keep on top of us to make sure this passes
8456218 we want a national standard of excellence and performance for our students
8456219 we are trying to fill in the gaps so there isnt any leakage when we need to come together
8456220 the answer is to have congress put together bills to address how we can give people more choices on energy
8456221 if we do that home by home well start to impact our carbon footprint
8456222 we need to spend time on research for energy thats cleaner
8456223 when we can move big corporations through grassroots well see some big more permanent changes
8456224 a child growing up today needs to learn about their impact on the carbon footprint
8456225 we have to educate children to make better choices than we have

8456228 overall we had a good balance with him in the side
8456229 he could have stayed on he was disappointed twente didnt have a go because he always wants to test himself
8456230 i took him off because he has only just come back from the hamstring injury
8456231 we want to play with the best and that means qualifying for the group stage
8456232 i felt we were well organised disciplined and focused we were never really under threat
8456233 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday
8456234 we have been struggling for goals but i was never really worried it is difficult when you start the season with a champions league qualifier and an international
8456235 i was here on tuesday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal
8456236 someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time
8456237 fabregas is a big player he makes arsenal tick once you see him on the teamsheet its going to be hard
8456238 we played with belief and competed with them in the first leg
8456239 it is the first fossil of a pregnant turtle found in the world and its only the second fossil of an animal found in the world thats pregnant
8456240 its a very primitive turtle and its basically an ancestor of modern turtles so we can look at characteristics of the eggs and nests and we can learn about the evolution of these traits in turtles today
8456241 the turtle was prepared at the royal tyrrell museum so basically the fossil was removed from the rock so that probably took about a year
8456242 last year we finally finished the preparation of the turtle nest so i wanted to publish them together in a single paper so thats why its out now
8456243 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother
8456244 the turtle specimen was partly broken when it was first discovered it is this fortuitous break that revealed that the fossil was a mother
8456245 the odds of actually of finding an animal that died and was fossilized at the time it was basically laying its eggs is basically one in a million so when you find something like that you know youve found something that is unique
8456246 absolutely thats why we keep going back every summer in the hope that you actually find something new that was not known before
8456247 his family heritage and life experience have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation and restore our leadership in an ever more interdependent world
8456248 america s service men and women need a president and a commander in chief with the courage to serve the gift to lead and the ability to get things done
8456249 the big difference is that the new system has a lot more memory so what happened yesterday could never happen again

8456311 we have raised these concerns with the city and the tourism industry and have stressed the importance of ensuring uninhibited access by film and television crew to our visitor attractions this we believe is not only in the interest of the film industry but is vital to the marketing and tourism efforts of the city of johannesburg

8456371 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers

8456373 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8456374 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8456375 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8456376 in five or 10 years those lights will be competitively priced and will ultimately be cheaper than what we are buying now

8456398 it was interesting that when obama came on stage he was applauded but the crowd didnt go as wild as it did for the clintons
8456399 hes really put the pressure on himself for tomorrow night
8456400 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8456401 it was a very big gesture by hillary clinton although to a certain extent she was stealing the limelight as well
8456402 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8456403 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8456404 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8456405 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8456406 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution
8456407 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8456408 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8456409 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8456410 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8456411 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8456412 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8456413 try not to nerd yourself to death while im gone
8456414 we can categorically state that we have not released man eating badgers into the area

8456449 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8456450 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart

8456457 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8456458 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8456459 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8456460 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8456461 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8456462 were very proud and happy with how we did on that
8456463 we are hopeful that the strong efforts we have made toward improvement will pay off in rising scores and we are proud of the progress made thus far
8456464 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the democratic nominee for president of the united states
8456465 when it came time to vote i have to vote for the right candidate
8456466 we recognised we were all dealing with similar issues in a lot of areas
8456467 so rather than consistently reinventing the wheel we are talking about what we are doing and opening up our files for peer review
8456468 our main focus is on being relevant to the audience on all platforms people are looking for more than just watching tv shows that are pushed out at them
8456469 the biggest problem we have with user generated content is that what people are saying and doing is great but the quality is so poor we cant use it
8456470 kids will be able to create digital versions of themselves which can play games and do collaborative events all in a 3d environment based on storm hawks
8456471 these days it isnt enough to watch a show you have to be in it
8456472 if we can create content that meets their needs then we remain relevant as a broadcaster
8456473 in asia right now there are some exciting tv prototypes where you move your hand to increase and decrease the volume and you can press in the air to change channels
8456474 we havent put any investment in that yet but seeing the trends it might be worth it down the track we are keen to explore touchscreen technology if we had additional funds that is where we would invest some energy

8456500 my expectation would be that we will have another minority i think thats the reality of the current political environment
8456501 i think anyone getting a majority in the current political alignment we have in canada would be unlikely
8456502 it certainly will give whoever wins that election hopefully ourselves that mandate to proceed and to proceed quite aggressively for some period of time
8456503 its important if possible to verify my analysis with the other opposition leaders if theres an election i think its important to give all the parties a chance to prepare
8456504 a search of the address in derbyshire is under way and is expected to take several days

8456507 its a shame some low level staffer with little historic knowledge thought it was joe mccarthy not gene it probably made it through spellcheck so he thought it was ok it was spelled right
8456508 he was clearly ahead of his time and should be an inspiration to democrats today

8456515 all the clubs really do is dump them at a home and tell them what training days theyve got
8456516 theyre not really looking after them theyre just dumping them at places if they want to take teenage kids away from their families at such a young age they should take responsibility for their actions
8456517 you need to remember that greg wasnt stolen from his family

8456519 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8456520 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8456521 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8456522 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8456526 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8456527 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8456528 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8456529 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8456530 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8456531 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

8456544 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8456545 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8456546 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8456547 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8456548 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8456549 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8456550 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8456551 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8456552 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8456553 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8456554 who are open to doing something on the production side
8456555 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8456556 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8456557 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8456558 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8456559 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8456560 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8456561 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8456562 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8456563 a lot of the women who dropped off the list this year were for job related reasons
8456564 in some cases its simply a matter of the woman still has a powerful position but other women are relatively more powerful and pushed her down and off the list
8456565 certainly had she been the democratic nominee that probably would have catapulted her higher
8456566 shes still an incredibly powerful force shes way more powerful than any other female senator

8456572 there is no doubt that it was a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you who shaped the minds of the generation to come to israel and perform

8456593 eh huh well you know uh i think that there are there are so many issues in which i am not an expert but require you to be an expert uh that mm mm the most important job that i will have as president is choosing excellent people tuh help to shape policy and provide me with a clear set of decisions
8456594 barack obama will require you to work he is going to demand that you shed your cynicism that you come out of your isolation barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual uninvolved uninformed
8456595 in this new century americans and europeans alike will be required to do more not less so history reminds us that walls can be torn down but the task is never easy true partnership and true progress requires constant work and sustained sacrifice they require sharing the burdens of development and diplomacy of progress and peace they require allies who will listen to each other learn from each other and most of all trust each other
8456596 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
8456597 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8456598 sure we can to turn off the coal fired and gas oil fired boilers and the gas turbine generators in ten years we just need to start now building a large number of additional nukes and dams

8456601 holding a grudge against someone is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die
8456602 sometimes we respond with the intention of defending the side we took a position on
8456603 be around the change you want to see in the world
8456604 answering these questions often adds perspectives to the situation and youll realize that nothing good will come out of reacting your energy will be wasted and your inner space disturbed

8456609 countries have made it very clear that issue of forests need to be part of a copenhagen deal
8456610 thats important because emissions from deforestation account for 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions
8456611 parties were deeply committed and submitted proposals for solutions on the issues
8456612 all in all the group has made good progress its important to take this progress forward in pozna when we return to the issue of the ranges of emissions reductions for developed countries under the kyoto protocol
8456613 one of the cdms shortcomings is that it is not leading to enough investments in africa
8456614 there is a real risk of africa becoming the forgotten continent in the context of the fight against climate change unless we manage to design a regime going into the future that take into account in a much more comprehensive way what africas specific needs are not only on adaptation but also on fuelling clean economic growth

8456623 we believe we must also be willing to consider using military force in circumstances beyond self defense in order to provide for the common security that underpins global stability to support friends participate in stability and reconstruction operations or confront mass atrocities
8456624 we will defend democracy and stand up for the rule of law when it is under assault such as zimbabwe

8456630 its elegant math but doesnt fit within the type of distribution were seeing in actual flows at the discount note windows
8456631 there are billions of short term agency securities going to real domestic accounts managing hoards of scared short term money arbs can pick money up in dozens of other places without stooping to the auctions of 6 mo discos
8456632 the treasury backstop was meant to reassure debt and mbs investors especially sovereign funds and other foreign investors
8456633 however in the format leaked to the press this plan was construed as an imminent rescue at taxpayer expense and only fed the markets panic
8456634 clearly the media is reading its own copy or should i say drinking their own home brew the treasury hasnt stepped in because at present there is no indication that either fannie or freddie is unable to continue operating without treasury assistance
8456635 when the actual cash losses occur and the peak is expected by the enterprises and most external analysts in 2009 the charge will hit loan loss reserves not income
8456636 assuming fannie and freddie have conservatively anticipated default and severity some of those reserves may even be recaptured as income in later years
8456637 surprising since the only catalyst was apparently a press report suggesting that federal officials are likely to recapitalize the gses soon
8456638 we are not convinced that treasury needs to take any action over the near term
8456639 while the decline in the gses stock prices if they persist may pose challenges to any capital raising efforts down the road the short term stock price performance does not have any bearing on the success of the paulson plan
8456640 former olympian dale walters has gone from boxing to box lacrosse the burnaby native a bronze medal winner in the 54 kilogram bantamweight division at the los angeles games in 1984 and member of the b c sports hall of fame is pursuing a national lacrosse league franchise in vancouver for 2011
8456641 barack obama will bring down health care costs by 2 500 for the typical family and at long last deliver affordable accessible health care for all americans
8456642 took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and half million falling into poverty and million more losing their health insurance
8456643 because barack made that choice 150 000 more children and parents have health care in illinois he fought to make that happen
8456644 john mccain has served his country with honor but his refusal to change course even in the face of the failed policies of bush cheney is reckless and will not keep us safe
8456645 sen mccain says that american troops should remain in iraq perhaps as long as they have been stationed in korea and japan as if there were no difference in history religion or culture between our friends in asia and those in the middle east
8456646 weve been in south korea weve been in japan for 60 years weve been in south korea for 50 years or so thatd be fine with me as long as americans as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed then its fine with me i hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al qaida is training recruiting and equipping and motivating people every single day
8456647 in the last two years sen obama helped pass the new gi education bill
8456648 sen mccain and the republicans have centered their answer to our vital energy needs on one solution offshore drilling sen mccain calls for it in every speech white house analysts congressional analysts and the oil industry all agree that offshore drilling wont add one drop to our energy pool for at least 10 years will it do any harm the answer is we just dont know and neither does he
8456649 it ends up in new orleans except that i just saw on the news that gustav is predicted to be a
8456650 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8456651 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8456652 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8456653 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8456654 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8456655 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8456656 would anyone else like to take a whack at it i think my penis is a beat subject so if carnie would like to take a stab at it for the photo of the day go ahead
8456657 because of the drugs you might find that you cant pee and well have to administer a catheter
8456658 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8456659 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8456660 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8456661 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8456662 you need to understand that if i define rush a certain way that completely divorces it from how other people define it and you are using it that means that all your arguments are wrong and the game is fine you just
8456663 you need to understand that if i define rush a certain way that completely divorces it from how other people define it and you are using it that means that all your arguments are wrong and the game is fine you just
8456664 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8456665 individual risk annual premiums income grew 12 per cent to 484 million over the previous corresponding half reflecting 31 per cent growth in new business volumes increased planner focus on risk business and good growth in third party markets
8456666 weathering the difficult investment market conditions well demonstrating its financial strength and the resilience of its business model
8456667 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8456668 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8456669 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8456670 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8456671 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8456672 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8456673 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8456674 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8456675 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8456676 of course in my etz chayim this is translated as

8456680 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8456681 he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose
8456682 he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8456683 in his first presidential decison the selecgtion of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8456684 if like me you still belive america must always be a place called hope then join hillary chelsea and me in making sen barack obama the next president of the united states
8456685 im not a racist and i resent the implication i would vote for a black man in a minute but this guy look who he hangs out with all known racists and radicals therefore i would vote for this guy if he were older and more experienced and didnt hang out with racists but i could never vote for someone with such racist affiliations
8456686 im not a racist and i resent the implication i would vote for a black man in a minute but this guy look who he hangs out with all known racists and radicals therefore i would vote for this guy if he were older and more experienced and didnt hang out with racists but i could never vote for someone with such racist affiliations
8456687 he is presumed innocent until proven guilty oj has been a very bad person
8456688 if i did it this is the way it happened

8456694 earlier this year although elyssas ltr doesnt focus on the devices im interested in it does give a good overview of the mobile arena and how libraries have been using mobile devices thus far
8456695 this is a piece of technology which is going to impact us
8456696 it brings up a lot of difficult memories for my client
8456697 we realize those will come up at trial this is a hard case for her a hard case for anyone who lost a child in this way
8456698 shes been under those conditions for several months thereve been no problems with her
8456699 shes been taking her medication and obeying all the rules that were set out by the judge under that condition
8456700 she should be transferred to bellevue hospital for urgent medical and psychological treatment
8456701 she has been significantly traumatized and she needs immediate help
8456702 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8456703 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8456704 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8456705 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8456706 there was no second guessing it was absolutely the right thing to do
8456707 one thing we never run into is a john mccain field organization
8456708 theres a lot of information about john mccain that voters need to know
8456709 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8456710 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8456711 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8456712 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8456713 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8456714 i am sorry i have not been able to blog or update things have been very hard and busy mom is now in hospice house she wll probably be gone in the next day or so i love you all and thank you for keeping us in prayer joy
8456715 we are the veterans the iraq war veterans the anti war veterans
8456716 i just cant imagine driving through my neighborhood at home and seeing a security checkpoint
8456717 i definitely support the protest i have a lot of friends in iraq
8456718 it was scary at first but theyre just marching theyre trying to be americans i guess
8456719 i was part of vietnam and that was a hoax this iraq expletive is even worse
8456720 we need to vote with our feet in the street and make our message loud enough for the whole world to hear
8456721 we want our troops home now we want them taken care of when they get here the america i know would not torture anybody
8456722 im sure with obamas for profit audio tapes of his policies he will also have an audio tape of his speech probably a dvd you can buy probably posters you can buy and whatever his money men think of 400 million and counting thats what hes campaign has collected how shameful while military families struggle children go hungry in america and homelessness runs rampant and we are supposed to vote for obama hardly
8456723 la idea principal es que una ves se casen se vayan a vivir al pa s de origen de l
8456724 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8456725 theres no way a parent today can compare like schools with like schools
8456726 theres nothing available to the national government today that enables us to see across the nation on a comparable system which schools are falling behind and need extra resources
8456727 we want transparency and we are prepared to bring new and extra resources to the table to make a difference to disadvantaged schools and to make a difference on teacher quality
8456728 theres no point in the world with comparing a rich school on sydneys north shore with elizabeth north in south australia and how the school is going there
8456729 our whole plan is to analyse student population and compare like schools with like schools
8456730 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations
8456731 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8456732 were not only going to take the best practice there were going to take extra resources there
8456733 were pledging a school like that with difficulties would get resources of 500 000 a year extra to make a difference and to bring that school up to standard
8456734 it is time to change the quota regime and reduce imports which have unfortunately built up in recent years
8456735 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8456736 franklin duran and carlos kauffmann amassed their financial wealth by doing the bidding of officials of the government of venezuela
8456737 required procedures and the final confirmation of the parents death has meant the adoption process lasts a few months
8456738 there are way too many of them to be dealt with quickly
8456739 lebanon has not yet succeeded in enhancing the overall security of its borders in any significant manner
8456740 the presence and massive redeployment of armed hezbollah elements and their acquisition of capabilities both north and south of the litani river along with the continuous transfer of weapons from iran and syria to hezbollah are a blatant violation of resolutions
8456741 to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind and to resist attempts to prevent it from discharging its mandate
8456742 russias main aim is to get support from the organization for its military action and approval in one form or another for recognizing south ossetian independence
8456743 it is clear that russia is using it as a counterweight to the west in the conflict and its recognition of south ossetia
8456744 ended the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe
8456745 hi this is bob you can send me a file
8456746 i would not have spent six years working to get this thing passed if i had not believed it would save lives
8456747 for any harm or hurt that this hot mike private conversation may have caused i apologize my support for sen obamas campaign is wide deep and unequivocal
8456748 the people in hell want ice water and theyre not going to get it either
8456749 promise to use the full power of the presidency to expose the truth a full investigation of bushs illegal terrorist surveillance program needs to be conducted by your administration
8456750 look for one of 15 000 well think of something
8456751 with an eye for detail and a strong focus on research
8456752 the specter of condemnation hangs over all property nothing is to prevent the state from replacing any motel 6 with a ritz carlton any home with a shopping mall or any farm with a factory
8456753 it could probably be dangerous at times but i think if people are responsible it could be safe and good time for everybody
8456754 i dont think its dangerous at all especially when youre walking on campus and you live a block away
8456755 some real overcrowding on those sidewalks we have a lot of people coming out of the bars to smoke
8456756 its the number of people in and out through out the evening the number of people that gather on the street that are not in our control maybe some are our customers that have left who are coming in but the majority but the majority of the people out on the street are not our customers
8456757 we decided to try to fix that by building a deck on the back of the club thus we were able to provide a space for people to come out
8456758 he said that he and jeffrey had gotten into an argument over william not obtaining employment and helping out with finances william said that jeffrey had struck him with his fist during the argument william said that after being struck he had gone to find his glasses and found the switch blade knife in the bedroom he then took the knife and described stabbing jeffrey in the shoulder and side william said his brother then left and went to a neighbors trailer william said that he was tired of his brother hitting him so he stabbed him he further advised that they had both fought on several prior occasions with their fists but this was the first time a knife had been used
8456759 the time for change has come and barack obama is the change we need
8456760 full of dregs or fecal matter foul turbid or muddy

8456770 we own you you will do what we say when we say it and give us your money when we demand it if you dare to even criticize us you will be punished lose our support and be subjected to the hatred of your fellow gay and lesbian people whom we control
8456771 its hillary clinton as a write in candidate in november obama is unacceptable and mccain while serving our country and suffering for it has policies amp thinking that are too rigid and old fashioned its hillary or no one

8456789 isnt working when companies hire undocumented immigrants instead of legal citizens to avoid paying overtime or to avoid a union when communities are terrorized by u s immigration and customs enforcement agency raids when nursing mothers are torn from their babies when children come home from school to find their parents missing when people are detained without access to legal counsel
8456790 gives jack booted government thugs more power to take away our constitutional rights break in our doors seize our guns destroy our property and even injure or kill us
8456791 criticizing law enforcement officers for carrying out their sworn duty is unfair
8456792 our procedures for addressing humanitarian issues including child care situations go far beyond what any other law enforcement agency has in place we routinely conditionally release parents so that they can care for their children we have great compassion for the children involved quite simply however parenthood does not make you immune from having to comply with the nations laws and the responsibility for any family disruption lies squarely with the violator
8456793 the only solution is a resolve to enforce existing laws everywhere when they realize that there are no illegal jobs or freebies they will repatriate at their expense the same way they came so much for the straw man challenge we cannot deport 12 million
8456794 were going to compete and win in the state of california theres a lot of the political pundits that say we cant win in california we can and will

8456804 california recently has enacted comprehensive domestic partnership legislation that affords same sex couples the opportunity by entering into a domestic partnership to obtain virtually all of the legal benefits privileges responsibilities and duties that california law affords to and imposes upon married couples
8456805 the understanding that this word describes a family relationship unreservedly sanctioned by the community
8456806 realistically must be viewed as constituting significantly unequal treatment to same sex couples
8456807 o k great thats all we wanted man now well just live our lives knowing our job is done
8456808 my perhaps overly cynical view is that its probably too much to hope for a lot of good news stories coming out of iraq
8456809 iraq no longer occupies the status as the overarching all encompassing crisis that requires full national attention
8456810 i was walking around the city doing interviews without any kind of security or back up at all that felt great i hadnt done that in years a chinese restaurant takeout just opened up down the street from our bureau there were no businesses opening in 06 and 07 people are getting out more you see more people on the streets going to markets when i go to do interviews i can stay longer
8456811 marked drop off in the appetite for stories from iraq
8456812 thats partly due to the election partly because of the fatigue and partly because things have started to go right here the spectacular car bombs the massive attacks you just dont see them anymore a drip drip story thats getting a little better day by day doesnt make a headline
8456813 were it general powell running few would think black and white

8456816 we want to see both sides not take unilateral action that would prejudice an eventual outcome a reunification that all parties are seeking

8456818 if hillary clinton really wants the job he has no choice in the matter
8456819 the kids in jrotc are not exactly the football player types or those who go in for student government
8456820 i thought no way is the board going to do that
8456821 this is a program that takes a wide variety of students including a lot of students who dont have other structure and activities and has very dramatic impact in terms of helping to build that structure motivation and focus
8456822 i gotta say im not sure what happened to the straight talk express on this one
8456823 given the scientific evidence regarding marijuanas safety and efficacy in some clinical conditions
8456824 believes that states and local governments are best positioned to strike the balance between making sure that these policies are not abused for recreational drug use and making sure that doctors and their patients can safely access pain relief
8456825 theres a state desire for all eighth graders to take algebra but that is not the official standard
8456826 theyve always wanted a safety valve for the kids who werent ready yet because the system wasnt ready yet
8456827 notably the percentage of these students who scored advanced or proficient on the algebra i california standardized tests also increased from 17 percent to 20 percent
8456828 you threw a bunch of black kids in the algebra class and typically the education establishment would say now youre going to create a problem because fewer kids are going to pass but what do you know more kids are able to take it more kids are passing too
8456829 we always weigh the value of the journalistic impact against the impact that publication might have as far as insulting or hurting certain groups in this case we described the cartoons and felt that was sufficient
8456830 they are basically saying if you say we are violent we are going to kill you
8456831 in the entire criminal justice system the message seems to be if you get an underage girl drunk enough you can get away with rape
8456832 the extreme level of alcohol consumption appears to have clouded the memories of many people at the party jane doe the victim has no memory of anything that happened at the party beyond her initial arrival
8456833 if she cant remember anything that happened thats pretty strong evidence that she passed out drunk
8456834 we remain convinced that how these men acted is wrong morally and legally our client is committed to pursuing her civil remedies in large part to send a needed message that behavior such as these young men displayed is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated
8456835 there are few tax cuts we dont like but this one smacks of poll driven gimmickry
8456836 just pennies hed make you keep paying that tax instead of big oil
8456837 after the state increased tax credits for filmmakers in 2006 there has been a staggering rise in film industry spending up from 6 million in 2005 to 125 million in 2007 plymouth rock studios which reportedly hopes to begin building by 2010 has estimated the studio would create 2 000 jobs averaging 70 000 a year
8456838 the logical fallacy of attempting to undermine a speakers argument by attacking the speaker instead of addressing the argument
8456839 if we dont get universal health care we will continue to bleed money
8456840 if you think health care is expensive now wait until you see what it costs when its free
8456841 prevention activities tend to cost more than they save since the books appearance her observation has been borne out by studies of hundreds of interventions everything from offering mammograms for all women and prescribing drugs to people with high cholesterol to requiring passenger side air bags in cars and shortening the response time of ambulances
8456842 i dont buy that one iota people have less time to get sick of you there will be fewer reporters investigating you
8456843 toughening up obama who was and is the least experienced potential presidential nominee in modern american history
8456844 ten percent of the vote thats huge that would be five times the past high for a crossover vote and with a closed primary and most did so in the last three days before the deadline when i was really pushing it
8456845 i am absolutely committed to not raising a single tax on middle class americans people making less than 250 000 a year
8456846 the exact location of where in todays ground the ancient treasures have been stored up
8456847 but also gives an account of the strata which first had to be broken through
8456848 my principal objection to variant spelling is that it reinforces the pernicious idea that children and young people today cannot be expected to meet the difficult challenge of learning how to use language correctly
8456849 icentre aims to nurture and support promising bruneian ict companies that deliver interesting new products services and solutions for the bruneian markets and the region to accomplish this goal icentre cannot exist alone and need the support of an eco system thats supportive and conducive
8456850 i also question whether they have the quality of programmers designers managers as the top mmorpg gaming developers
8456851 theres no sign of a letup in my e mail inbox i can tell you
8456852 ive had to get on with it because it is so clogged up with e mails to save atlantis
8456853 give people a welfare handout and you make bums of them
8456854 has no business regulating an outdoor recreational sport that consists largely of people running and gliding down remote hills and sand dunes
8456855 i need only consult with myself with regard to what i wish to do what i feel to be right is right what i feel to be wrong is wrong
8456856 some believe in eating anything while the weak eat only vegetables
8456857 one mans faith allows him to eat everything but another man whose faith is weak eats only vegetables
8456858 if they fail to do so our party will deal them in the style we are known for
8456859 even if the offender happens to be a marathi he will not be spared by our party
8456860 the channel is owned by a marathi speaking family and i will extend all my support to a marathi entrepreneur who has abilities similar to media baron rupert murdoch
8456861 it is brihanmumbai municipal corporationss job to ensure that the rules on signboards are followed no party has been entrusted with the responsibility of enforcing the law those not following the rules as well as those running riot will be dealt with strictly

8456876 dan feels helpless when a pre wedding gag organised by his brother goes wrong and dan finds himself tied to a tree while a horrific accident occurs right in front of him extricating himself from his bonds dan does his best to keep the casualties alive and calm while he waits for help
8456877 a woman has been badly injured and her husbands panic complicates dans attempts to assess and administer first aid to her
8456878 on arrival in the ed dan pitches in to help while the rest of the all saints team deal with the casualties
8456879 meanwhile erica has been notified of whats happened and races into the ed to ensure her groom is okay its obvious hes not and when dan elects to postpone the wedding the race is on to change his mind about getting married
8456880 will the days events be too difficult for him to overcome or will love prevail
8456881 we have a massive infrastructure here with 300 hectares of land and 800 to a 1000 personnel on site
8456882 to have students moved outside the airport the city boundaries is a question i cant really answer
8456883 airports in built up suburban areas are common moorabbin bankstown in sydney archerfield in brisbane and parafield in adelaide and they are also big training airports
8456884 mid air collisions are extremely rare theres not an issue of safety
8456885 stop we gotta get on with the show here cmon
8456886 i love this and i thank you but we have important work to do tonight i am here first to support barack obama second im here to warm up the crowd for joe biden
8456887 the small business owners who were there just spent the best 1 000 of their business lives
8456888 free and low cost tools to get the job done
8456889 it might take a few games to get back in the groove
8456890 spread out the minutes and didnt kill them with practice time
8456891 a lot of our players didnt have any legs they were exhausted
8456892 the one thing coaches and gms complain about during the season is they dont have a lot of practice time with their key players
8456893 for them its a great time to get their key players involved in working well together the coaches probably loved it players probably hated it
8456894 the break was good to diffuse some of the negative team publicity from the incident we had with los angeles
8456895 we had gone through an emotional time for three or four games after that
8456896 especially at the start we didnt want to see their faces for a while and im sure they felt the same way about me
8456897 the basketball at the beginning of the season is a little rougher before people get settled in
8456898 it might take a few games to get back in the groove but i think people are in great shape right now and theyve been playing together a long time
8456899 id vote to have a 10 day break in our season every year just to get our legs back
8456900 i cant specifically pick one the best race is one in which your team takes a 15th place car and finds a way to finish fifth
8456901 people with stopwatches timing pit road speeds is a whole lot less accurate than computers
8456902 ive gotten a lot but the best came from my mother treat people the way youd like to be treated
8456903 i let him cross me over going into turn 1 on the last lap
8456904 ten years ago i didnt care about any of that stuff
8456905 today its just cool to slow down and take a break and be aware of things
8456906 a lot of drivers know that but cant say it because people would say theyre not committed what we do in nascar is exceptionally important from a business and professional standpoint but how you interact with your children community family and friends is more important early in my career i was afraid to do anything else besides race because that might mean i wasnt focused ive learned you can do both
8456907 im lucky at 41 to have a team that supports me 100 when the trend is everyone wants a 23 year old
8456908 theres days i dont do as good a job as i need to and i have the confidence to tell these guys that and they dont lose faith
8456909 jeff is obviously a leader that has taken our sport to the level it is from a safety standpoint
8456910 to be regarded as the guy who could win and also had a positive impact in more ways than just on the track
8456911 i try to put forth the effort to make sure thats the legacy and ill put my effort against anyone
8456912 when youre doing it you have to make sure no one is trying harder but theres a time you shouldnt be trying
8456913 if you dont stay here and you dont know whats going on around here it should be illegal
8456914 i prefer you to stay here if you gonna represent it do it the right way
8456915 he lives there hes a good kid good professional young guy honest decent integrity help the community i support him 100 percent
8456916 was she seated on the throne in the restroom amp you douchebag paparazzi followed her in or did she just
8456917 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
8456918 the right of law abiding citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home
8456919 even though im an advocate of gun control its very hard to read the second amendment and not see an individual right
8456920 the second amendment protects militia related not self defense related interests
8456921 the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society
8456922 the best weapons against them should be the butt stroke first theyre a menace they should be rounded up and put into foreign detention centers for the benefit and safety of the rest of us
8456923 this court erred in its decision in dc vs heller and accordingly that ruling is reversed
8456924 this increase seen with heated seats is unlikely to be a significant issue unless you are sitting in a car for a long period of time on a regular basis with the heater on
8456925 but these are the types of things men should be considering if they want to have a baby but are having trouble conceiving
8456926 try wearing baggy underwear and getting out of your vehicle a few times during the day if youre a taxi driver or truck driver
8456927 we started pretty well for the first quarter and a half after that they probably got a run on and stifled our midfield getting the ball forward
8456928 we only had about 30 inside 50s for the game your not going to kick a big enough score
8456929 obviously we didnt think we played that well so to only lose by five goals with a lot of players down its encouraging for the next time we meet them
8456930 not only is kirsten dunst not dating vanwyngarden she was in los angeles during the festivals the sun claimed she was attending in europe
8456931 vanwyngarden never dated fabiola gatti also mentioned in the piece we find it funny there could be so many things factually wrong in such a small amount of column space
8456932 families making 200 000 a year are not rich theyre not even close to rich
8456933 i would certainly describe that as the nations highest income earners
8456934 thousands urge the press to ask questions on global warming
8456935 state department feels public pressure in run up to climate conference
8456936 the europeans have a perfect right to look down on the united states since theyve set much more ambitious targets for reducing global warming while they do not appear to be likely to meet any of them its the thought that counts
8456937 its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
8456938 i didnt say it as well as i should have
8456939 barack obamas skin color may cost him some working class white voters but its also winning some votes among blacks and among whites eager to signal their open mindedness
8456940 in essence seven judges agreed with the core ruling that the kentucky process was not unconstitutional
8456941 it is not a little ironic and telling that lethal injection hailed just a few years ago as the humane alternative in light of which every other method of execution was deemed an unconstitutional relic of the past is subject to todays challenge
8456942 were lower than that required for surgery in 43 of 49 executed inmates
8456943 a massive exhibition about the history of video gaming featuring every game i have ever seen some brand new machinima by eddo stern i was super excited to meet the few australian chiptune people dj trip
8456944 it would indeed be very nice if we could convert any one cell type into a different one
8456945 a very elegant and important contribution to the reprogramming field
8456946 about an ad agency in the 60s some people like this show so much that they create fictional profiles on twitter and pretend to be characters amc caught wind of this and decided it wasnt too thrilled
8456947 someone must have pointed out the irony of shutting down the free advertising that is mad man fanfiction tweets
8456948 after saawariya sonam was looking forward to working with ranbir everything was fine till she was told that deepika was also in mera jahaan thats when she said no
8456949 we had approached sonam there was a meeting with her and we told her that ranbir kapoor was part of the project and deepika was under consideration but sonam said she did not want to do a two heroine project at this stage of her career it was her call thats fair enough
8456950 she cited the two heroine reason because deepika was the other actress she did not even want to hear the script after hearing this
8456951 rani and lara came together as guests on the show they were very chirpy with each other but as soon as they walked on the stage to face salman the equation changed
8456952 it was evident that salman was more comfortable talking to rani than lara even his jokes and his one liners were directed towards her lara looked like she was out of place
8456953 salman and lara got along really well in partner but after that they really havent interacted much lara was in the running for the lead role of main aur mrs khanna but she wasnt too happy with the way she was dropped from the film that remained a sore point between the two moreover lara is also part of srks billoo barber and as sallu detests anyone who has anything to do with srk as of now could also be a reason
8456954 sallu and lara were hanging out a lot during the partner period in fact it was salman who recommended lara to david dhawan for the film there was even buzz that the two were more than just friends
8456955 i normally dont talk about my personal life but his name is raj kundra we met a year ago
8456956 for the next 18 months ive got my hands full with work so i cant really think of marriage yet but after that i definitely want it to culminate in marriage and of course im dying to have a family at least two children
8456957 i spoke to her and we exchanged numbers it was really emotional i can only ask people to pray for her because there is a lot of power in prayers
8456958 the parallels are interesting at least obama wants to treat us the way apollo treated the enterprise crew as children who need do nothing but gather food and worship him he promises them peace tranquility and happiness as long as they agree to become his servants and relinquish their free will in the end kirk and his crew destroy his power source and send him off to his fellow demigods in bitterness rather than allow themselves to become enslaved to apollo
8456959 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8456960 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8456961 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8456962 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8456963 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8456964 thanks but no thanks 3rd time is not the charm
8456965 took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs an increase in of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and half million falling into poverty and million more losing their health insurance
8456966 because barack made that choice 150 000 more children and parents have health care in illinois he fought to make that happen the facts obama did none of this single handedly but as a member of the childrens health insurance program he also helped pass legislation to raise the income threshold for eligibility and make the temporary program permanent john mccain has served his country with honor but his refusal to change course even in the face of the failed policies of bush cheney is reckless and will not keep us safe
8456967 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8456968 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8456969 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that is our candidate and he will be our president
8456970 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8456971 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution president of the united states
8456972 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8456973 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8456974 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8456975 and just in case you were wondering i think reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8456976 gt reportan dos heridos tras balacera en estaci n del metro san l zaro en el df
8456977 that whole area is just so vulnerable to an intense storm its like rolling a bowling ball down an alley if it hits its going to knock some pins down
8456978 when you start looking at the details the gulf has an impact out of proportion to the percentages because its close its cheap and its always there
8456979 if it goes into galveston texas and beaumont where the big refineries are it could be catastrophic
8456980 theres limited capacity to absorb damage and repair it quickly
8456981 we have a 64 processor beowulf cluster that does the modeling we can do differential equations and look at satellite imagery
8456982 but these longer range forecasts meh were not that smart
8456983 then they will have to go back to 8 people in a broken down toyota

8456985 al gohary asked to quit his post two months ago i tried to convince him more than once but i failed
8456986 this represents an investment not only in kentuckys economy but also in the future of this country
8456987 the long term security and economic health of this nation depends in part on its ability to become energy independent this plant and the vehicles its designed to produce could be an important part of that strategy
8456988 the odds are pretty high we wont get to 60 but its not out of the question
8456989 the chatter about whether democrats can pick up enough seats in november to hit the magic number of 60 and a filibuster proof majority is getting louder
8456990 its not as good as 60 but its close enough to get a lot done
8456991 no tax increases of any kind for anyone earning under 200 000 a year
8456992 a single tax on middle class americans people making less than 250 000 a year
8456993 it depends on how you calculate it the income level but it would be between 200 000 and 250 000
8456994 he loves me he wants to start a family this and that
8456995 which claims to protect them i have found that these reports are very easy to access the problem is not in accessing them the problem is in a resolve to them this is part of a bigger issue which i touched on in my last post about the lack of response to complaints
8456996 that campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8456997 in this case the third time is not the charm
8456998 we need more time because we are just getting to know each other
8456999 this was a marriage proposal that he said no to those allegations have been legally proved baseless shoaib was always single
8457000 its so flattering he makes special trips just for me and showers me with attention i am in love i guess
8457001 our religion is not an issue i am more concerned about the distance between us
8457002 i dont know whats going to happen tomorrow but i believe when you want something from the heart the whole universe conspires to get it for you i hope that happens for us
8457003 i keep imagining all kinds of things when i cannot reach him
8457004 by converting plant mitchell to biomass we hope to not only help grow the renewable resource base in georgia but also to expand the market for renewable energy credits which ultimately will foster additional renewable energy development
8457005 the utilities do not turn a blind eye to the environment and this is proof of that
8457006 this one is sitting here its past its prime and its time to do something with it
8457007 since 2002 the price of natural gas has increased more than 400 percent
8457008 i play basketball and football i like hanging out with
8457009 we announce today that david villa and valencia will remain together for many years to come
8457010 it is a very happy day for me in the last month and a half lots of things have happened around me that i have not experienced before
8457011 i want to thank valencia for this gesture i am very grateful to this club for what they have given me and i hope to continue to give good performances
8457012 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8457013 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8457014 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8457015 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8457016 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8457017 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8457018 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8457019 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8457020 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8457021 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8457022 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8457023 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8457024 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8457025 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8457026 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8457027 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8457028 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8457029 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8457030 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8457031 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8457032 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8457033 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8457034 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8457035 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8457036 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8457037 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8457038 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8457039 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8457040 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8457041 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8457042 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8457043 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8457044 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8457045 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8457046 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8457047 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8457048 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8457049 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8457050 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8457051 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8457052 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8457053 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8457054 we drive by it everyday coming and going so we dont really notice it
8457055 id like to see them tear that building down because it is such an eyesore and possibly build some high rise apartments 20 to 30 units its a good location convenient to everything
8457056 it would be advantageous for the chattanooga market if something family oriented came along whether it was shopping or a restaurant something that brought families out and of course bring them over our way on sunday
8457057 and if i did not return rock the perimeter credential we alternated which gave us access to many other facilities and events when the other had the floor credential there would be hell to pay
8457058 it took a little wind out of us theres no question
8457059 the wins are sweet but the losses are so bitter and people dont understand how devastating it is to lose any game
8457060 youve got to get yourself off the mat and get ready to go again and we didnt do that last year
8457061 its over you cant go back to the past all you can do is learn from it and get better and i think we have done that
8457062 to win your first game gives you a little positive momentum a chance to get things moving in the right direction
8457063 hopefully that positive momentum continues to go throughout the course of the season
8457064 we know what we have to do as a team and we know how good we are
8457065 bless me father for i have sinned i have been stealing lumber from my employer
8457066 enough to build my house and a house for my brother
8457067 well i also built a house for my sister and a brother in law
8457068 because of the extraordinary amount you have stolen an extraordinary penance is required id like you to make a novena to st joseph
8457069 well being a new catholic i dont really know what a novena is but if you have the blueprints i have the lumber
8457070 its a great look at what it means to be a fan at how nascar creeps its way into our everyday lives if you want proof that youre not the only nascar fan who is non southern non redneck non homo phobic non fill in the blank with your favorite stereotype and youre not crazy for spending your hard earned money on little metal cars you should read this book
8457071 his writing is strong and clear his convictions spring from every page and his love of nascar is obvious i have a hard time imagining somebody having more fun writing anything than wilson must have had writing this book read it and youll know what i mean

8457075 entonces yo quise ir a su oficina la oficina del historiador que ocupaba la planta baja de la casa lombillo
8457076 al llegar yo a la oficina por primera vez me encontr en la planta baja con alfredo zayas alguien que tuvo un alto significado para m como lo tuvo para roig era su referencista y fue el m o por muchos a os cuando la idea de la computadora era impensable tanto para el maestro como para el disc pulo
8457077 zayas me present a victoria valle espinosa la guardiana de la biblioteca y poco despu s me introdujeron al conocimiento de la secretaria de roig que era su hija adoptiva y querida gladys monteagudo
8457078 el museo municipal me atra a much simo y estaba tambi n en la planta baja de la casa lombillo junto al archivo y la biblioteca
8457079 con ese pretexto que era una motivaci n m s bien iba all todas las semanas
8457080 d ndome cuenta del error que hab a cometido de las desacertadas opiniones vertidas y siendo un habitual de la oficina decid que el nico camino posible era la reparaci n p blica donde se hab a producido mi intervenci n e ir a ver al interesado
8457081 enseguida solicit verle y mar a me pregunt que para qu
8457082 ah comenz la verdadera amistad y creci mi admiraci n por ese hombre
8457083 con el apoyo de aqu l a quien roig llamaba cari osamente primo aunque no eran familia gonzalo roig y con zoila salom n su esposa realizamos un concierto semanal en el patio del palacio motivado por el poema en bronce inscripto en sus paredes de la autor a de ngel augier
8457084 premiando al autor del poema al patio del palacio municipal se produjo la comunicaci n con augier y con otros hombres de la cultura como jos zacar as tallet muy amigo de emilito roig desde la juventud entr en un c rculo que se fue abriendo

8457090 mr lee explained that unlike other democracies like britain in which mps form the government singapores system emphasises on choosing political parties so when an mp is elected it means voters are also giving the mandate to the party represented by the mp to form the government

8457094 wow thats not something you want to hear from your doctor
8457095 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states said the former president who presided over a great run of prosperity in the u
8457096 not ready to lead and this is the one leader whom this party lends an undivided ear
8457097 in the end my candidate didnt win clinton said of his wife sen
8457098 but im very proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children and im grateful for the chance chelsea and i had to tell americans about the person we know and love
8457099 like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8457100 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world clinton said
8457101 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8457102 he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8457103 his policies on the economy taxes health care and energy are far superior to the republican alternatives he said
8457104 he has shown a clear grasp of our foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to repair our badly strained military
8457105 his family heritage and life experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation and to restore our leadership in an ever more interdependent world
8457106 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8457107 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8457108 he will work for an america with more partners and fewer adversaries
8457109 he will continue and enhance our nations global leadership in an area in which i am deeply involved the fight against aids tb and malaria including a renewal of the battle against hiv aids here at home
8457110 barack obama also will not allow the worlds problems to obscure its opportunities
8457111 these challenges cry out for american ideas and american innovation when barack obama unleashes them america will save lives win new allies open new markets and create new jobs for our people
8457112 most important barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8457113 the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8457114 as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues
8457115 they took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs down to 5 million from an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and a half million falling into poverty and millions more losing their health insurance
8457116 now in spite of all the evidence their candidate is promising more of the same more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans that will swell the deficit increase inequality and weaken the economy
8457117 the industry forces have been bearing down on the entire industry dealer network
8457118 frankly in the last four or five months its been very challenging to our dealers
8457119 if there was a pace there is no plan to be at two times the pace or three times the pace
8457120 at some point youre in competition with your fellow dealers
8457121 look at some of the other manufacturers that have quite a lot less number of dealers its going to make us stronger
8457122 now we can look to the future everything that was playing against us now is going for us
8457123 he mr glenn stated his view then that he had contributed money whether it was to new zealand first or to some other fund thats lost in the mists of time but as i say at every time that this issue has arisen i have rung mr peters and asked for his word
8457124 i have not known mr peters to lie to me and i have to take people as i find them he is utterly convinced that he never made that call he and mr henry are utterly convinced that mr henry made the call
8457125 i am really not in a position to adjudicate i am in the position where an honourable members word has been given and its been given in parliament as well as in many other places
8457126 i understand that mr henry will be absolutely clear that he made the phone call
8457127 i am not their advocate i am not their defender i am simply saying that he will be totally clear about that
8457128 i think the handling obviously leaves a great deal to be desired and perhaps the legacy of that is mr peters relationship with the news media is a very confrontational one and one that he almost delights in having but it doesnt make for good handling of difficult issues
8457129 i dont think anything mr key does ties two other parties together
8457130 who we work with after the next election will entirely depend on what deck of cards the electorate send us
8457131 youre almost investing time when no one is watching and hoping that it works out
8457132 and when you enter an olympic center later on that does sort of alleviate some of the costs but by and large you are spending thousands dollars by yourself shawn johnsons parents actually mortgaged their home twice in order to support her career in gymnastics which clearly paid off but at the time you dont know
8457133 i retired after my first olympics i couldnt afford to stay in the sport
8457134 i had to have a way to make money and pay for my existence so its tough you need to sacrifice a lot you have to really want it you have to be looking at the whole picture and find a way to live within small means in order to be an athlete
8457135 when you look at it after its over theres a tremendous sense of self satisfaction and joy that you actually made it and you did it and youve fulfilled your dream

8457142 america cannot be strong abroad unless were first stronger at home
8457143 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8457144 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8457145 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8457146 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8457147 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8457148 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8457149 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8457150 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8457151 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8457152 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8457153 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8457154 ugh mom you are soooooo annoying cant you just tell us

8457157 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

8457176 i think when the thing is over ill hardly remember who sponsored the events
8457177 my judgment is that members should be very careful before they attend an event because of the implications and how it can be used politically
8457178 its not that its right or wrong its just that i dont have the time for that
8457179 look youre never going to keep these lobbyists players out of the equation completely
8457180 but what you can do is to make sure that there is a lot of transparency about how they conduct their business
8457181 it would indeed be very nice if we could convert any one cell type into a different one

8457193 im just so honored that someone such as alan white who has been such an integral part of music history lennon harrison whew i am just honored that our songs were included on this cd thanks white
8457194 this is such a great feeling we have waited anticipated cried and almost gave up but finally the white record will be on the shelves
8457195 when i listen to whites album i recognize a sound that puts them amongst the elite of rock and roll
8457196 the essence of white is the great core of its members the album reeks of its great soul
8457197 long anticipated but well worth it now the world can hear what weve all been enjoying for so long
8457198 it is about time i have been waiting for the white cd to come out for a long sound has such a refreshing drive and kevins vocals and the bands harmonys are very refreshing so excited
8457199 its so nice to see alans passion re kindled in another band you can tell he is very proud of white so much so he has lent his name
8457200 i would not have missed this release party for anything reconnecting with old friends and making new ones i love the guys randy oxford alan was an idol of mine in the 70s in chicago so to be here in seattle 30 years later at his release party is just cool

8457218 its a world we better figure out because we cant ask our students to come into a classroom put those things aside and sit in a row and think were interesting
8457219 there has been a tendency to use technology as a substitute for curriculum
8457220 technique and how to ideas have taken the place of deciding what it is exactly we want these children to learn
8457221 but i have nothing against the technology if its in the service of grown ups facing their responsibilities to decide what the students need to know precisely if they did that these technical gadgets will be valuable
8457222 it gives kids a chance to use things they already use in real life and make that connection in school
8457223 we did have to take a hard line approach to that
8457224 you can restrict all kinds of stuff and you can drive yourself nuts trying to police all of it they culbreth are probably kind of opening themselves up to something
8457225 these teachers say this pilot signals their commitment to our students to meet them where they are as opposed to where the teachers are comfortable

8457242 i felt strongly when nick died that there was some greater meaning to his death
8457243 and the way the community reacted the way everybody reacted when he died it just caused the debate to take on such a heated tone in phoenix in particular and i thought maybe i could elevate the discussion somehow
8457244 you ought to be ashamed of yourself for being used you ought to be ashamed of yourself for pitching for lawbreakers you ought to be ashamed of yourself and i dont know how you can look at your kids and do this
8457245 im sure if her husband were alive today knowing how his legacy is going to be used or his memory is going to be used to further the cause of the very thing he took an oath for to uphold the law he would be ashamed of you and im ashamed of you
8457246 when the next police officer is gunned down or killed is it fair to blame you
8457247 because i am going to give you partial blame put that in your legacy for your husband
8457248 my comments were never aimed at julie erfle the widow
8457249 i empathize with the tragic and senseless death of her husband fallen hero nick erfle however anyone who wants to be an advocate promoter or spokesperson for amnesty is opened to be criticized
8457250 el club jam s ha adquirido desde que nosotros ejercemos nuestras funciones medicamentos o productos ilegales es algo que ya le advertimos al presidente en el mes de marzo igual que los dem s equipos los jugadores de la real pasan m ltiples controles antidopaje que nunca han detectado el consumo de sustancias prohibidas
8457251 primero nos dijeros que sali ramos con ropa deportiva luego nos ordenaron no participar y al final nos dieron un escrito detallando las nuevas funciones

8457256 i voted for hillary but my heart was with kucinich
8457257 you dont want to learn about the devil because youll be opening up your soul making it vulnerable to him
8457258 they are aircraft and types of accident that are not related to each other at all
8457259 the geographical split has become more extreme over the years
8457260 accidents in north america europe and asia with the exception of indonesia have become fantastically rare
8457261 we need to all start talking about what we do every day
8457262 the value of green week is in encouraging conversation about sustainability and what it means for purdue and the broader community we need to move together as a group
8457263 the centers are collaborating on these green week activities to spark a lively discussion of research and reality at the intersection of climate environment energy technology alternatives and policy
8457264 as a community we will explore the new paths we must take to determine how we can live and grow our global community
8457265 hot flat and crowded why we need a green revolution and how it can renew america
8457266 friedmans writings focus on the importance of having a very serious conversation about whats happening now and what we can do in the future
8457267 we will work with our allies to ensure georgias territorial integrity as a free and independent nation
8457268 the georgian people won their freedom after years of tyranny and they can count on the friendship of the united states
8457269 that young democracy has been subjected to an unjustified assault
8457270 but the recognition of these unrecognized republics will without doubt stick in the minds of a lot of people in the north caucaus
8457271 in chechnya there is still separatist sentiment so a precedent will be set if one lot of people can have it then why cant the others it will have an impact
8457272 russia shouts about western double standards at the top of its voice but does not have the slightest hesitation to use the same method
8457273 they called what had happened a genocide it is very hurtful and funny to observe all this from the point of view of people who went through the complete destruction of a nation and on top of that were called a nation of bandits
8457274 inaction by russia on the georgian regions would have been absolutely not understood least of all by the population of the north caucasus
8457275 it has become clear that russia in the north caucasus is strong and it is prepared to act including with arms without taking account of anyones opinion
8457276 im not into looking for signs i think well continue to make our case europe the united states and other leaders around the world will make the case to russia that this is a very shortsighted decision on their part
8457277 i think russia has gotten the message im not going to try to speculate as to when that message will influence their decision
8457278 i repeat that it is very dangerous and there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova
8457279 however that would not be ruled out as part of a global settlement in accord with the united nations
8457280 we regret this decision for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we cannot support this position
8457281 what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country any nation could be next any country when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country
8457282 i repeat that it is very dangerous and there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova
8457283 we need to raise the question about the lease payment and new financial conditions because those old conditions were set when there was no market for land deals and assets which the russian fleet uses were not considered as assets which must be paid for
8457284 we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict we dont intend to allow troops which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country to use our territory as a base
8457285 we aim to enter the pan european system of security because we are convinced that today there is no other alternative way of protecting ukraines territorial integrity her sovereignty
8457286 the status of the man is such that he has small cut on his forehead which will require stitching and medical attention
8457287 he has been taken by ambulance to auckland hospital and after an assessment hell be safely transported home
8457288 if we are moving in the direction of a new cold war it will be harder to find a joint solution to problems such as the nuclear conflict with iran
8457289 of course cooperation on the iran issue could fall victim to the current confrontation between the united states and russia but this does not have to be the case
8457290 in past months the u s has moved away from unilateralism on this question and moved towards more multilateralism
8457291 it makes the enforcement of already ratified sanctions against tehran more challenging and significantly reduces the chances of consensus for the imposition of a fourth round of punitive sanctions against our nation
8457292 the downward spiral in relations between russia and the west will make it harder to work together on anything and iran policy heads the list of areas that are going to suffer
8457293 finding consensus on additional security council sanctions was hard to begin with
8457294 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
8457295 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment
8457296 it will not become easier to lead a third war in the middle east just because one now also faces a conflict with russia
8457297 its no use denying theres a huge amount of tension in the relationship following the georgia intervention but there will be a lot of determination to keep the iran show on the road
8457298 everyone believes russia will no longer join u s pressure on iran
8457299 hostility to the war at home in the middle east and elsewhere in the world has had negative effects on the u s image and ability to galvanize the international community on any issue be it the iranian threat or even support for georgia
8457300 russia now has fewer reasons to cooperate with washington regarding irans nuclear program
8457301 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8457302 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8457303 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8457304 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8457305 when wii sports was first released many gamers fell in love with the baseball minigame
8457306 disagree strikers for me at least is the best multiplayer game ever next to brawl
8457307 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8457308 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8457309 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8457310 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8457311 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8457312 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8457313 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8457314 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8457315 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8457316 lauracreekmore hes pumping the issues and the theme of a diminished economy is continuing this evening
8457317 im sure my butt is going to shrink but theres so much of it im not worried its going to go away
8457318 barack obama will lead us away from division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope

8457323 everything ive learned in my eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8457324 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8457325 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8457326 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8457327 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8457328 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8457329 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8457330 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8457331 i would look at this place and say home sweet home home sweet home to psych myself up i was ready when the time came and it was a very good move

8457337 no i knew what to expect because id visited my friend at the willows many times and knew what life there was like
8457338 i like the socialization and i love my apartment being scandinavian i love lots of light and there are five windows in my place
8457339 you dont have yard work you dont have to keep up the house one of the things i like best is getting up from the table and leaving the dishes
8457340 i watch my health and diet carefully and take lots of vitamins
8457341 so the genes are there they were in a nursing home when they died im hoping to avoid that thats one fear i think we all have of being dependent and a burden to somebody else
8457342 perhaps some caregiver assistance and i hope it could be right here
8457343 some residents hire their own caregivers who help them bathe and dress in the morning and put them to bed at night
8457344 after that theres assisted living at summit place right behind us and behind that is mount baker nursing home hopefully ill never reach that stage
8457345 ive decided when i can no longer drive and travel ill get a cat
8457346 itu kan sakit sekali sakit lho kok kamu tidak merasakan sakit sih
8457347 lagipula ini khan bukan rasa sakit fisik tapi sakit di dalam hati
8457348 why on earth did obama give the clintons two nights
8457349 in this case the third time is not the charm
8457350 republicans said i was too inexperienced to become commander in chief
8457351 like this sawyer guy has the same freaking stubbly beard even though theyve been stranded for a month
8457352 so would you rather watch a movie ive got some dvds
8457353 how on earth did you have enough money for all this stuff anyway i mean this is a really nice tv
8457354 i already had it back home in florida it was one of my dads apology gifts
8457355 psychological near death experiences the marriage of heaven amp hell
8457356 fragmented demarcation like swiss cheese makes it impossible to adhere to the constitution
8457357 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularised by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer in short women are abandoning the church
8457358 la raz n por la que te odio y nunca te podr querer
8457359 bill clinton and the liberals gulp the kool aid on night 3 of convention updated
8457360 the second one was visual and it happened when clinton called on the 18 hillarys 18 million voters to back obama half the place stopped cheering and sat down
8457361 what are aj and the other repubs going to use to bash this thing
8457362 i will say anything to promote my partys views reality be damned
8457363 its like a four day long high school spirit rally with ugly people i dont know all on behalf of thuggish soccer team that sexually abused my sister
8457364 to restore americas standing to what it was eight years ago
8457365 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8457366 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8457367 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8457368 rfid tagging of pallets in warehouses is pretty much proven but being able to track tagged items as they move on a conveyor belt or across a yard or parking lot presents an additional set of challenges
8457369 its going to take solutions such as metafi to enable the integration that users want and need to take maximum business advantage of the data generated by rfid in motion
8457370 imaging for primary and secondary prevention improving the detection gap
8457371 asnc2008 showcases how far weve come as a profession and the new research and technology that are helping advance our field even further
8457372 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8457373 i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8457374 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for president of the united states by acclamation
8457375 i have been asked to inform you that senator obama accepts the nomination
8457376 you want to vote according to what is in your heart i am not going to tell you what to do you have come from different places and made a long journey
8457377 president clinton will lay out the choices that we face on foreign policy
8457378 he will talk about how barack obama has what it takes to be a strong commander in chief
8457379 as we look for the best choice for new baseload generation we recognize that nuclear fuel costs are much more stable over the long term
8457380 americans are about six percent of the worlds population and we account for about forty five percent of the worlds philanthropy among americans believers are far more generous than secularists among believers protestants are more liberal in their giving than catholics among protestants evangelicals are more generous than mainliners but if you were ask a secular arbiter of all that is philanthropic for his opinion on how we were doing he would invert the whole thing that much said when the standard is gods generosity to us most of us are not nearly as generous to others as we ought to be we should pray for grace to overflow more liberally still but we may be pardoned if the evangelical artesian well producing 20 gallons a minute while wishing it could be 40 doesnt want to hear lectures on charity from the dry hole of secular leftism
8457381 its a huge step forward on the new road of making that alaska gas pipeline a reality
8457382 we have north americas premier independent pipeline company working with us now
8457383 whatever we can to put forth an attractive commercial proposal
8457384 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8457385 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8457386 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8457387 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8457388 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8457389 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8457390 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8457391 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8457392 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8457393 dad has a variety of diagnoses and it was house related issues that drove the process
8457394 it was decided a couple of years ago that they would move to bellingham and be closer to us
8457395 they also wanted to be near some assisted living facilities just in case one of them needed to be in assisted living and the other could stay in the condo
8457396 theres a real dearth of housing options for lower income seniors or those slightly above that level
8457397 home modification issues are not cheap either and often they happen in a crisis someone may return home after being in the hospital and find that they cant get their wheelchair through the door this is why people have to start thinking about that in their 50s and 60s before they need it
8457398 were certainly hearing that seniors are spending more on housing than they used to either because they might not have their house paid off before they retire or their taxes have increased while they remain on a fixed income
8457399 what a lot of people dont know is that there are so many more choices now than there used to be
8457400 people can decide to stay in their own homes and have in home care and their meals delivered or they can live in a senior community or assisted living
8457401 im disabled and i had so many things done safety is not an issue for me anymore
8457402 when people come through our loan program first we look at health and safety issues such as leaky plumbing or electrical issues and then address long term maintenance and general property improvements
8457403 weve loaned out millions of dollars since this program started in 1977 but a lot of people dont know about it and its been spread more or less by word of mouth
8457404 i have a lot of older clients and some just treat me as a handyman and want me to change a light bulb for them
8457405 sometimes you dont know how much those little things can impact someone you dont want them to fall off a chair and break their hip
8457406 i think people who are older dont want to ask for things but with this you get to pay it back so its not a handout
8457407 when i someday die or go to a nursing home many years to come this house will be able to go to somebody else who is disabled and it will be accessible to them
8457408 its a different kettle of fish than most buyers and sellers
8457409 some seniors are going to need a reverse mortgage for example and youre not going to see that with first timers theyre just looking at houses a little differently
8457410 it gives my mom a deck to have plants and it downsizes their garden into pots
8457411 you have to be careful because aging parents want a degree of independence and may not want to be in a mother in law unit
8457412 they may want to be nearby but not right next door for some people 100 miles is the best distance because no one can just barge in unannounced
8457413 ask lots of questions and sit back and listen do they want to be within 10 minutes of the hospital or their doctor or near walking trails or hills its not just a matter of are the doorways wide enough for wheelchairs but also where they are in the community
8457414 you dont see houses with wheelchair ramps around very often i can tell you
8457415 they dont want to call attention to an issue of disability
8457416 independence is important so anything that might make people wonder about some infirmity becomes an issue
8457417 they were hanging on to their independence for as long as possible
8457418 they realized that they would have to leave their friends and their home and so the timing had to be right i might be comfortable but they may not be ready
8457419 its nice to have those conversations along the way about what theyll need what theyd miss what can we do that is similar to what they have now so they can maintain their same lifestyle dont be afraid to talk about it because these are important conversations to have before some crisis happens
8457420 he is a family pet and he was doing what dogs do to protect their owners
8457421 youre going to see lots of cool things a lot of scary stuff
8457422 make the most of it fall down get back up all that good stuff
8457423 think of the person youll present back to your family and how proud theyll be
8457424 hopefully some of you will make it all the way to the pentagon then yall can brag you came from the dale jr division thatd make me really proud
8457425 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8457426 the most frustrating part of it is not able to express myself as well as i should
8457427 thats exactly what my doctors have said and therapists have said it cant come soon enough i envision a full recovery
8457428 its not clear three months or six months from now i expect to experience full recovery in my speech
8457429 this has been a long journey home a journey that has taken longer than some people have liked and i count myself among them
8457430 my discomfort arises from both my inability to get words out and my articulation that will improve but not for now
8457431 it was a postrace incident involving two highly competitive drivers both of whom are in the midst of battling for a championship the issue has been addressed with both drivers and they both know where they stand
8457432 all across the world in every kind of environment and region known to man increasingly dangerous weather patterns and devastating storms are abruptly putting an end to the long running debate over whether or not climate change is real not only is it real its here and its effects are giving rise to a frighteningly new global phenomenon the man made natural disaster
8457433 the issue of climate change is one that we ignore at our own peril there may still be disputes about exactly how much were contributing to the warming of the earths atmosphere and how much is naturally occurring but what we can be scientifically certain of is that our continued use of fossil fuels is pushing us to a point of no return and unless we free ourselves from a dependence on these fossil fuels and chart a new course on energy in this country we are condemning future generations to global catastrophe
8457434 oh no scientists are all evil wicked men out to make us scared so well all turn communist
8457435 leemans and eickhout 2004 found that adaptive capacity decreases rapidly with an increasing rate of climate change their study finds that five percent of all ecosystems cannot adapt more quickly than 0 1 c per decade over time forests will be among the ecosystems to experience problems first because their ability to migrate to stay within the climate zone they are adapted to is limited if the rate is 0 3 c per decade 15 percent of ecosystems will not be able to adapt if the rate should exceed 0 4 c per decade all ecosystems will be quickly destroyed opportunistic species will dominate and the breakdown of biological material will lead to even greater emissions of co2 this will in turn increase the rate of warming
8457436 another reason for concern regional and global impacts on ecosystems for different levels of climate change
8457437 the breakup is the latest of seven major antarctic ice shelf collapses in the past 30 years after some 400 years of relative stability they include the detachment of a 1 300 square mile chunk from the lars en b ice shelf the disintegration of giant ice shelves in the prince gustav channel and the larsen inlet and the disappearance of ice shelves known as jones larsen a muller and wordie all of them corroborate temperature measurements showing that the western antarctic peninsula now known to insiders as the banana belt is warming up faster than anyplace else on earth
8457438 of course the fact that new undersea volcanoes discovered there
8457439 if you dont know if your ancestor in 3000 bc had cancer there is no way science can say you have cancer now
8457440 whats it going to be like when the temperature starts taking radical swings then ends up extreme in either direction
8457441 everyone below this line will have to be evacuated to the south everyone above this line is already dead people like us in the middle states will have to ride it out the balmy southwestern states might have a chance but new york will have tidal waves which will envelop the northeast
8457442 the breakup is the latest of seven major antarctic ice shelf collapses in the past 30 years after some 400 years of relative stability they include the detachment of a 1 300 square mile chunk from the lars en b ice shelf the disintegration of giant ice shelves in the prince gustav channel and the larsen inlet and the disappearance of ice shelves known as jones larsen a muller and wordie all of them corroborate temperature measurements showing that the western antarctic peninsula now known to insiders as the banana belt is warming up faster than anyplace else on earth
8457443 i just dont think that humans are to blame for the change in our climate
8457444 i dont believe anything our mainstream media and government officials tell us anymore
8457445 the breakup is the latest of seven major antarctic ice shelf collapses in the past 30 years after some 400 years of relative stability they include the detachment of a 1 300 square mile chunk from the lars en b ice shelf the disintegration of giant ice shelves in the prince gustav channel and the larsen inlet and the disappearance of ice shelves known as jones larsen a muller and wordie all of them corroborate temperature measurements showing that the western antarctic peninsula now known to insiders as the banana belt is warming up faster than anyplace else on earth
8457446 the results for temperature and pressure suggest that the arctic may be a temporally leading indicator of greenhouse driven changes despite its large natural variability
8457447 had it not been for that citizen calling who knows what would have happened
8457448 the only comment we can make is were gathering all the facts and well be representing him in the case
8457449 getting signed up as a saas customer is fast but getting out is just as fast whereas traditional software is like cocaine youre hooked
8457450 my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8457451 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8457452 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8457453 fragmented demarcation like swiss cheese makes it impossible to adhere to the constitution
8457454 one thing i ask of the lord this is what i seek that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to gaze upon the beauty of the lord and to seek him in his temple for in the day of trouble he will keep me safe in his dwelling he will hide me in the shelter of his tabernacle and set me high upon a rock
8457455 if you own the house you should be able to own the property under it
8457456 it will be nice for the people to be able to own the land and be able to borrow money to fix it up
8457457 it should be a win win and help preserve one of the unique neighborhoods on the rockaway peninsula if not in the whole city
8457458 to the naked eye to anybody who has never been down there and doesnt know what a summer night is down there they really look like nothing
8457459 but for the people who have spent their summers down there for 50 years they are everything
8457460 this property means the world in sentimental value it has been a home for generations and generations for these people
8457461 home ownership is the backbone of a growing and vital community this legislation allows the longtime residents of the area ownership of their property
8457462 weve been here for the last 20 years and made a lot of friends
8457463 theyre going to miss us and were going to miss them
8457464 its not just for old timers its an incredibly welcoming place
8457465 these kinds of places are few and far between and we need to help them find another location
8457466 the food is terrific and they served the best irish soda bread before every meal
8457467 its a place where you can chug a few beers and have a great burger i think the neighborhood is losing a cozy friendly place
8457468 weve had a good run but maybe the customers will find another place
8457469 we felt we were part of a larger family in the neighborhood
8457470 we cant go to another bar and pretend it is mcreillys
8457471 if three years ago someone had said to me on the streets of new york that somebody named barack obama would be our nominee i would have said they were crazy
8457472 i volunteered for him for two years and most of that time i never thought he would win
8457473 this is something people like me have been waiting for for days weeks years
8457474 hes going to the white house hes going to be our next president
8457475 this is one of most significant events in american history
8457476 i think about all the suffering all the pain all the hurt of so many people
8457477 what you see happening here tonight is the down payment of the fulfillment of dream of martin luther king
8457478 just a few short years ago in georgia alabama mississippi many people of color could not even register to vote and now these people are voting for an african american
8457479 it was an amazing moment not for african americans for americans
8457480 i wanted to be on the floor not only as a democrat as an american but clearly as an african american when i was a little girl i never thought id see this day i never thought id see a viable female candidate viable minority candidate get this far
8457481 when we were kids our parents would tell us we could grow up to be anything we wanted to be we giggled because we knew certain doors were closed after this historic year those gates are now wide open so this is an exciting moment for the entire country
8457482 i was deeply moved and i think that youd have to be a curmudgeon if you dont see the historic nature of this evening gop conservative analyst amy holmes said
8457483 it is a milestone that we witnessed here tonight in our countrys ability sometimes to just say you know the past is the past
8457484 look how hard he had to fight just to win the nomination
8457485 its not just democrats that are going to vote in this election i want to think he can win but i live in the real world
8457486 its demonstrating that this party has come together and were going to be a united group
8457487 we have taken a large step toward reconstruction in this country
8457488 offended mothers were calling in and saying i shouldnt be doing this that they werent going to see it
8457489 we are continuing to see deterioration as we come around to these institutions
8457490 an appraisal can be outdated in three months it can happen that fast
8457491 two years out a whole project can be totally different
8457492 we never have gone into a downturn as we are now with banks having such concentration in commercial real estate
8457493 just when you thought you had sources of liquidity suddenly you may not
8457494 liquidity is one of those things where as long as you prove you dont need it you can get money anywhere
8457495 we are struggling to see how an offer would be value accretive to our shareholders in view of our strong result announced today including a further 25 percent growth in containers over the past financial year
8457496 at extremely favourable rates compared with rates that could be obtained today
8457497 port of tauranga continues to lead the new zealand market in terms of trade volume efficiency and profitability
8457498 higher and rising inflation is having an effect on pay negotiations in the private sector but pressure on profits is also a key part of the picture as the economic outlook worsens
8457499 people around the world have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8457500 there are files from all kinds of sources that we want to store and manage files are created by our digital cameras e mail cell phones portable media players camcorders pdas and laptops increasingly computer users are using different folders drives and even different computers such as a laptop and a desktop to store manage retrieve and view files yet managing hundreds or thousands of files is still largely a manual operation in some cases it is necessary to regularly get copies of files from another location to add to primary location in other cases there is a need to keep two storage locations exactly in sync some users manage files manually dragging and dropping from one place to another and keeping track of whether the locations are synchronized in their heads other users may use two or more applications to provide this functionality now there is an easier way synctoy a free powertoy for microsoft windows is an easy to use highly customizable program that helps users to do the heavy lifting involved with the copying moving and synchronization of different directories most common operations can be performed with just a few clicks of the mouse and additional customization is available without additional complexity synctoy can manage multiple sets of folders at the same time it can combine files from two folders in one case and mimic renames and deletes in another case unlike other applications synctoy actually keeps track of renames to file s and will make sure those changes get carried over to the synchronized folder
8457501 i understand the responsibility that comes with being west ham manager but the supporters have to realise the effect it has when theyre not behind us
8457502 ive put up with this for a little while now but im a big boy i can cope
8457503 i intend to stay here for some time this is a job i enjoy and feel i can give more to
8457504 it disappoints me that this speculation continues but i suppose that is how football goes
8457505 the disappointing thing for us is that gerrard will have to have a groin operation in the morning
8457506 he will be out for around 10 to 15 days he needs to have the operation because he has been in a lot of pain we knew he had this problem before he went on international duty with england last week for the friendly against the czech republic but yesterday i spoke with the club doctor and with steven and he agreed he needed the operation
8457507 it is not a serious injury ten to 15 days is not long but he needs it
8457508 hes a special talent hes not as fit as id like him to be but considering he had chicken pox three or four weeks ago he was sensational
8457509 hes been a bit frustrated because hes not been in the fold
8457510 at one time a team blackburn would have 14 or 15 top premier league players now they have 22 or 23
8457511 these financial results principally describe the companys on premise business which was sold in july 2008 cloudbench is now solely focused on local government manager we believe that an increasing number of cities will prefer the rapid deployment and low cost of saas over traditional on premise software
8457512 follow me walk faster i walk fast when im angry keep up boys walk
8457513 holy toledo mother of mackerel i cannot believe you would do such a thing seriously i mean really boys what were you thinking
8457514 a highly trained elite group of cybernetically enhanced observers using the latest and greatest in modern surveillance technology each camerahead agent has been hand selected and specially modified for their unique ability to monitor the public with a complete disregard for anyones personal privacy
8457515 my favorite tunes well theres i am a camera by the buggles eye in the sky by the parsons project rockwells somebodys watching me
8457516 our state is better prepared than it has been before to respond to a major disaster
8457517 but i want to emphasize that our citizens have a personal responsibility
8457518 its still too early to tell exactly what its going to do
8457519 if a tree comes through the roof and buries them underneath there theyre going to be on their own
8457520 the citizens should not be worried about the flooding again
8457521 china which has own separatists will be the biggest problem
8457522 the recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia is unacceptable for beijing
8457523 were not going to twist anyones hands to make them support recognition
8457524 it doesnt appear that any of them knew they were going to iraq
8457525 a few were told they were going to work at an american camp they thought they were going to work in america
8457526 the safety and security of all employees and those the company serves remains kbrs top priority the company in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behavior
8457527 its swinging like somebody caught in a tree and thats when you can really see the cabling and its the exact same shape of a body same size everything but its just covered in moss
8457528 its exactly what it looks like just somebody caught in a harness in a seat harness
8457529 we are very enthusiastic about the prospects of these projects in granite falls st peter and thief river falls
8457530 with the addition of these three projects we are now actively working on approximately 19 projects in some stage of development the addition of these projects is very representative of our process we sign initial agreements and then move along the development cycle with our local owner groups over a normal course of time until we construct and commission a wind farm while all of these projects take some time to develop we have a good idea of their potential success before we ever sign initial agreements
8457531 adding 3 projects in the last couple of months is also representative of the strong demand in the market for community wind farms
8457532 since going public with our increased awareness we are receiving regular inquiries from groups of local owners almost on a daily basis this is exactly what we hoped for when we went public at the end of june we want our friends in rural america to know that they dont have to turn their land over to large wind developers instead they can work with us and own their own wind farm and keep a much larger share of the economic benefits for themselves and their neighbors
8457533 i get up and five days a week i come down to the ferndale senior center and play pool for a few hours
8457534 he just lays around the house with me sometimes he plays with a ball
8457535 its just friendly and nice and comfortable and thats the way i like it
8457536 my daughter gave me a cribbage board shaped like a fish
8457537 yes ive got a daughter who is the best in the world
8457538 there is only one way to keep your family happy be nice to them
8457539 the quicker we can get that communication out to both our public safety and to the entire campus the faster we can respond as a whole and then hopefully mitigate whatever is taking place
8457540 its those unimaginable things that really test us on how well prepared we are
8457541 if you get to the point that my only option is to fight out then anything you have can be a tool i mean if you have a pen a pencil cell phone laptop
8457542 i would highly encourage no one to drive around thinking that my position my title my power is going to get me out of those because weve seen time and time again it doesnt happen
8457543 theres a huge liability to that officer once he comes in contact with that you cant let that person drive away
8457544 its been proven over and over again statistically that drunk drivers kill people drunk drivers kill themselves they kill other people they kill innocent people and everyone knows it its not a secret
8457545 people are paying us to do that job and we would be remised to the citizens of that community if we didnt do our job
8457546 thats extremely difficult to hear because they do so much good and its a great place for some of those people to be employed and i do know some of their employees so its very hard for me to here that but its a real struggle
8457547 just recently i was involved with an event with the optimists club asking for donations and each one that i went to said they get multiple requests per week and its getting very hard for them to decide who theyre going to support
8457548 giving is something thats personal and giving feels good and so its something that an individual can connect with theyre going to say yes
8457549 usually on mondays i get up and work out at the bellingham senior center and do my shopping and running around
8457550 i remodeled the house and eliminated the laundry room in the basement and moved it upstairs that makes it easier
8457551 my independence being able to take care of myself and feeling like i can do what i want to do
8457552 exercise stay healthy and eat well common sense type things
8457553 i like to stay active and the senior center is a good outlet for that
8457554 i pretty much go to the ferndale senior center every day except tuesday
8457555 i am in charge of the dining room making sure there is help that day i am very active in everything that goes on there
8457556 if i want to do sewing or sit and read or watch tv thats my privilege
8457557 my kids took off the front porch steps and put in a ramp it is easier to go up and down
8457558 i cant think of anything i think ive had a pretty decent life
8457559 be active dont just sit and feel sorry for yourselves
8457560 im not a game person but i do enjoy bingo
8457561 the telephone is the only thing i dont know what i would do without a telephone
8457562 my kids watch after me if i need anything all i need to do is call them
8457563 at the ripe age of 17 i joined the u s navy
8457564 for me to be a sailor and fly my silly airplanes and not get killed
8457565 my wife was a strong enough lady and strong enough wife to take care of my family if anyone gets any credit she does
8457566 were all close enough to have dinner together once a week
8457567 with all the things that happened and i didnt die
8457568 if it was not for pacific northwest cardiology i would not be here
8457569 now theres someone to help and make sure its correct
8457570 there are an awful lot of things to do here
8457571 anyone can be as friendly or standoffish as they want but being standoffish isnt very much fun
8457572 we dont like people to park in handicap places if theyre not supposed to
8457573 hunting and fishing with my dad and brother is probably as good of a time as ive ever had
8457574 my dad saw to it i was a much better than average fisherman and a much better than average hunter
8457575 the care you get from the staff i cant say enough they go out of their way to accommodate everyone
8457576 if you divide that up most of them have been damn good years
8457577 ive been everywhere ive wanted to go done everything i wanted to do you thank your lucky stars it turned out that way
8457578 particularly when i got so damnably sick i learned im not still alive because god wanted me to be alive i believe im alive because god didnt want to disappoint my wife i believe with all my heart that god answered my wifes prayers
8457579 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8457580 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8457581 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8457582 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8457583 you can have it all just not all at once
8457584 our thoughts have turned to the mother of this baby and we are concerned that she may need some help
8457585 we are urging her to go to her local hospital to get the attention she may need it may be that she wants to speak to officers who are looking into the babys death

8457597 el esquema de las tabacaleras que llevan a los productores el t cnico el insumo la tecnolog a el producto y aseguran la compra es muy bienvenido por los productores

8457602 this is a useful tool for customers to quickly resolve any gel coat issues that may arise
8457603 we think this information will help manufacturers achieve consistent results and the fact its bi lingual is a valuable benefit
8457604 the use of composite materials and need for specialized engineering solutions are both expanding so rapidly that the partnership with vistagy is extremely important for us
8457605 fibersim is the leading software available to engineer composite products in the aerospace and automotive industries so were confident that we can help vistagy continue to extend its worldwide leadership position
8457606 we also think vistagys airframe development environments have great appeal in our market because the software enables aerospace engineers to design and manufacture airframes much more efficiently and cost effectively
8457607 we have recently experienced a significant level of activity in the indian market and csm vigyan is well positioned to take advantage of it it is a very well regarded company with a long history of building strong relationships with its customers our partnership with csm will enable vistagy to make an impact in a market that is increasingly strategic for us and will also ensure that our customers are well supported and successful
8457608 if mccain wins in november given the stain his party has spread across this country
8457609 when people come through the door many of them are really frightened
8457610 theyre often bewildered they think you have to give up everything they have all these ideas theyve picked up from old tv programs and old movies about the horrors of nursing homes
8457611 people are often surprised when they see that our facility smells good when they see that people are smiling and in contact with each other and when they see how children are laughing
8457612 not only is that inaccurate but it would be illegal
8457613 we give everyone a book outlining their rights and this helps a lot
8457614 some seniors dont understand what they see in their brains are the nursing homes of the 1950s and 1960s
8457615 they dont really know that assisted living is a new choice in our society ive been in this field for 35 years and ive seen all the improvements its so much fresher and better now we have training programs so staff members arent just thrown into a situation
8457616 independent living is a great way to simplify your life so that youre free to do the things you want to do without worrying about the things you have to do
8457617 from my experience people pretty much always want to stay at home
8457618 its almost always their first preference and its cheaper to stay at home
8457619 a lot of what we try to do is to consider home rehabilitation programs
8457620 i just want people to know its not a black and white decision to stay or leave
8457621 i work with people in their 80s who are in great shape
8457622 part of anyones decision making process is if i run out of money can i stay here
8457623 i dont mean necessarily beautiful with chandeliers but a great environment comfy cozy and just home
8457624 as much as i love my children loving dogs has been the constant joy in my life
8457625 i love movies i have spent a lot of time with friends on the island
8457626 i looked for a place that would give me some independence
8457627 here you can furnish it yourself and not have to use institutional furniture the staff is very caring without being overbearing
8457628 it wasnt long for me to say to the dog lets go home while we were out walking
8457629 when i came here it was far more homey than i expected
8457630 the fact that my friends showed up in droves and almost had to take tickets like at baskin robbins helped
8457631 it just happens and in no time at all i have friends the dog helps along with smiling and asking how people are doing
8457632 it is a comfortable setup in an almost ritzy restaurant style the food is very good with a lot of options suitable for diabetics too which i have
8457633 i think there comes a point where people should consider assisted living
8457634 it isnt as bad as they fear but they need to be sure wills are made and you do a really good survey of your finances because this is not cheap
8457635 if you go in and youre depressed and grumpy it will be a challenge
8457636 i went in smiling and making it personal if you do that i see how people open up to you
8457637 people are recognizing it a little more than they ever used to so were thankful for that
8457638 theres a lap around the bellingham public library square for survivors only its a thrill to know youve beaten this thing and are walking with your fellow survivors
8457639 i used to take pride in planting annuals every year i havent done that since 1999
8457640 i have a craft room where i could just get lost its well stocked thanks to treasury of memories and stampadoodle
8457641 the lebed method is very helpful my arm doesnt ache and it stays normal size
8457642 you get those endorphins moving and joan is so good she makes it fun i just feel good shes our dancing granny
8457643 i couldnt even say cancer thats how scary it was to me but it isnt any more
8457644 ive always had a very positive attitude and i still do i have a very loving and caring husband and thats made all the difference in the world
8457645 in 1980 i started not feeling well and i had cancer which was unreal and unexpected because here i was helping all these cancer patients
8457646 through all of this my body disintegrated and it took me a long time to recover
8457647 i was in hospice and not expected to live but i fooled them all and pulled through
8457648 there were a lot of financial concerns with all the sickness
8457649 when i first came home from the hospital two ladies named may tankey and june roberts came over every day and gave carl a break
8457650 everyone was always praying and i have to say god had a hand in it and he has a purpose
8457651 if the need is there get a hold of hospice
8457652 they not only help you physically but they help you mentally
8457653 having faith has a lot to do with it too and determination
8457654 im sure i was nervous but i had a lot of faith i knew the doctors and i had all the faith in the world in them
8457655 i think everyone in the family has my paintings strewn around
8457656 ive slowed down considerably i was always on the go and i wasnt home very often because i was involved in so many things
8457657 now i eat right i never was too concerned about my diet until i got sick i think that it is a big thing to stay at the right weight and eat the right foods
8457658 my family is so good to me so attentive they treat me like a queen and i have to say i like it
8457659 when you notice your car has dents and you dont know where they came from or when they occurred you probably caused them
8457660 or when you have those moments where youre saying to yourself wow that was close
8457661 and i have a bad hip my reflexes arent what they should be for safe driving
8457662 ive never had an accident and i did a lot of driving so i figured i might as well stop now
8457663 im very independent so in a way it was a difficult transition to make since i dont have the spontaneity and control i used to have
8457664 but in some ways im actually enjoying my trips more im seeing things i could never see while i was focused on driving and the wta bus drivers are wonderfully helpful
8457665 when my mother was 72 she was diagnosed with cancer and she handed me the keys to her car
8457666 please dont make us the police and the department of licensing make this decision for you
8457667 our focus in specialized transportation is service to people with disabilities
8457668 were neutral with regard to peoples ages although a large percentage of our riders are seniors about 80 percent
8457669 these people are eligible under ada standards although many of our senior riders use our regular fixed route service especially now that we have five go lines serving our densest areas of bellingham
8457670 these are the lines where riders never have to wait more than 15 minutes for a bus during regular hours of operation
8457671 ive been in a wheelchair more than 30 years and bill for five years wta is the only transportation we have since we cant get in and out of cars
8457672 the wta drivers have treated us so well i cant say enough about how grateful we are to them and how good and professional these people are
8457673 they have given us a life im sure they dont always feel like being cheerful but they are and thats a real important part of their service in helping us get around the drivers are willing to provide services they arent required to do
8457674 we got locked out of our apartment and our driver was so concerned about us he called for permission to go through one of our windows to get our keys we had a screen and he fixed it perfectly after he finished helping us
8457675 i had a mini stroke not long ago and lost part of my vision
8457676 i was still driving and it was quite hard to give it up especially since loretta has severe arthritis and has not been able to drive for many years
8457677 but ive discovered the wta drivers are very good at helping us i dont know what we would do without them weve lived all over the country and ive never seen a better system for people with disabilities youre allowed four bags per person for example when you go shopping
8457678 this hasnt slowed us down at all though you do have to plan your days more
8457679 you have to call one day in advance and you can go two different places in one day
8457680 i had a stroke in 2000 and my eyes suddenly became much worse
8457681 i had to give up driving i lost all my alphabet but i can still see some just not words and numbers
8457682 so what do i do i use audiotapes for my books and ive created a system of yellow sticky notes with black writing i can read to describe everywhere i want to go
8457683 i still use regular fixed route bus transportation as much as i can
8457684 i decided to learn all about the bus routes by actually riding the buses around so i could learn all i could about bellingham and this has worked out fine for me ive never been slow about doing what i need to do i figure i still have to take care of myself
8457685 i dont use the specialized transportation very often but i often do call a cab when i go somewhere and i have too much to carry and when im just worn out im sure im saving a lot of money over driving by using buses and cabs
8457686 compare that to the cost of owning and maintaining a car and buses and cabs become a real bargain for seniors
8457687 we contract with the wta and we work with the northwest regional council an area agency for aging in a federal program we have integrated our senior support system with the community and were happy to do so
8457688 our drivers are now all employees and they get a wage no matter how short trips are they now undergo background checks all of our drivers also now take pre employment drug test
8457689 when three or four seniors get together for a shopping trip for example a cab becomes a pretty inexpensive way to go and were here 24 7 although we do recommend reservations whenever possible we also have wheelchair van service which is very important for the needs of some of our customers
8457690 seniors are a very important part of whom we serve
8457691 we feel we help many seniors every day and that feels very good
8457692 it wasnt my eyes that were the problem but rather my feet i had nerve damage my kids were so happy when i quit driving but they didnt want to tell me
8457693 i used to live in the country on a farm so i love to get out in the country and i still do
8457694 the internet and customer service representatives will provide all the information youll need
8457695 people need to do their homework about the transportation security administration screening process
8457696 the tsa web site is the biggest change in preparing to fly the site provides all the information youll need
8457697 when a person makes a reservation he or she should be sure to tell customer representatives about any needs for special assistance
8457698 dont just assume theyre going to know you need to communicate and let them know your needs so they can help you
8457699 dont be afraid to ask for help after all everyone has moms and dads but if youre someone who is not familiar with airport procedure its going to be a special challenge if you havent done your homework
8457700 if you are initimidated easily its good to have a sponsor family member neighbor friend etc to help you
8457701 flying is crowded but the common touch hasnt gone away
8457702 there was always someone there to help at the airport
8457703 i got a wheelchair at sea tac airport and there was no confusion for me i was just fine
8457704 all you have to do is be sure to plan well
8457705 if a group of seniors wants me to speak with them i always want to make the time to talk about the issues theyre concerned with
8457706 reaction time motor muscle skills legs hips knees shoulders they all can play a major role in safe driving
8457707 there are no special laws aimed at senior drivers as long as theyre healthy and capable
8457708 hey im 56 and i dont try to do what 24 year olds do
8457709 i have limitations and i have to live within those limitations
8457710 a police officer can require a re examination at the department of licensing if we feel that is necessary
8457711 ive submitted three of those ive talked with drivers in their 90s whom i would consider safe drivers but what i always say is please be mature about it and know when its time to hang up the car keys
8457712 its very important to know a cars capabilities and limitations too
8457713 the no 1 accident with regard to auto damage is backing accidents
8457714 ive always made sure all my cars have had good mirrors people need to know where the four corners of a car are at all times and upkeep of the car is of utmost importance
8457715 the real key to safe operation for seniors or anyone else is good vision
8457716 you need to be comfortable at the posted speed and you need to maintain that speed
8457717 i would say you need to drive within five miles of the speed limit on the freeway when weather safety and traffic conditions permit
8457718 it was as if we had a mini summit to make the decision
8457719 i offered to try and get a congregation closer to kent it was serendipity and great fortune that i applied to the united church of christ in blaine and was called there
8457720 then we noticed over the summer fathers descent into alzheimers
8457721 theyd been married for 66 years and mother did not literally know what to do since father was being cared for we tried to care for mother
8457722 have a conversation with the doctor and ask what can i do to prevent having the person come back to the hospital
8457723 good questions between a patient or caregiver start to get clear with the doctor the following
8457724 i would suggest that if youre going to be in the hospital for a period of days call ahead of time and ask for a social worker to come see you and your caregiver while youre there
8457725 they can help you with discharge planning and other things
8457726 these were emotionally difficult times and we supported each other
8457727 mom hardly left his side we were there almost all the time to support her and he made it through
8457728 im certainly a person who trusts people but its just like working with teenagers as a pastor or counselor i would caution trust but verify
8457729 if there are siblings brothers sisters or parents have an active and authentic dialogue or conversation with each other about how you feel about the situation and discuss what you need to do to be as one in terms of care so that no one gets left out of the information loop
8457730 there are some wonderfully humorous moments like the time father tried to put his dentures on his eyes and his glasses in his mouth
8457731 the purpose in having trained and skilled people at the end of the phone line is that we can drill down from your initial questions and find out the real underlying problems
8457732 often if we just answer the first question we miss the underlying problem or a whole area so thats why we really prefer people to call us
8457733 we have a list of doctors who take new medicare patients but they might not be able to see you immediately
8457734 so if you have an emergent need before that the only two resources are the emergency room at st joseph hospital or the walk in center if you can wait over a period of weeks to see a doctor then we can give you a list of doctors
8457735 we also have a program that we link to called the family caregiver support program in that program if you are the caregiver then you are our client and were dealing with your decision making and your finances
8457736 for example do you need an occupational therapist or physical therapist in your home to check things out
8457737 we can send people in to consult with you so while lesleys working with the client you can work with lesley too because she can access the family caregiver support program for support or respite some people with low income need help with respite care and we can provide that its a state and federal service
8457738 she tries to stay around but every now and then you need to be someplace else
8457739 for the last several years ive been going back to visit them with the idea being not so much to help my mother but to give ann a break
8457740 typically its a social visit but seems to serve the purpose to help my sister if she wants to leave she can
8457741 it gives her a chance to let it go for a while
8457742 the last time i visited we discussed funeral arrangements mother is 87
8457743 although she doesnt remember it now shes the one who suggested moving into that situation
8457744 my sister and i have been quite fortunate that mother gave up driving on her own and then said i want to live in a retirement home
8457745 with a caregiver often youre working with their perception of their parents needs
8457746 we much prefer to work directly with the senior we will support you as a daughter or son in outlining what your concerns are and then we want to talk to the seniors themselves
8457747 too often caregivers come in and say i need to put my parents in assisted living then we talk to the parents and they have no intention of going into assisted living that may be a plan down the road and were dealing with their needs right now they may only need someone to come into their home once or twice a week and help them
8457748 you want to let people make their own decisions as long as possible
8457749 i dont know if we started treating our parent like a child earlier than necessary but lately weve noticed that mom is forgetting a lot of things so when we drive her to the doctor we go in with her because she cant remember what she was told to do
8457750 but weve got the same vision of how we should take care of our mother and thats a real plus for us
8457751 he had a huge shop so what we did was bring a van loaded with his favorite tools now he especially enjoys spending time in it
8457752 home is such a big part of peoples history and being people do not leave that easily
8457753 cooking was my hobby and i had a collection of 4 000 cookbooks
8457754 i had been collecting all those books in wyoming for many many years but i knew it was time to let most of them go i still have a few of my favorites though
8457755 my message is extremely important dont wait too long before you move be aware of your physical limitations thats so important
8457756 i havent had any of these problems since i moved to fairhaven estates
8457757 but its so important for me to know help is right here for me if i should need it
8457758 i began to realize i was getting tired and i began to realize we move only one way
8457759 i always thought time would drag when i got old but its just the opposite i found that time flies when you get old
8457760 i had a beautiful condo in lynden but all of a sudden i realized i needed to be with people
8457761 i love people and so i made a definite decision i wanted to go to assisted living
8457762 i came to bellingham because i strongly wanted to be closer to family
8457763 but after three years of living alone i was tired of cooking and eating by myself i welcomed the change to the willows i found it was easy to make new friends here
8457764 some people need to be sociable while others need to consider where they can have quiet family visits
8457765 lots of people have fears of abandonment i try to help relieve fears and anxieties whether people are staying in their own homes or relocating
8457766 it all comes down to adequate preparation and dealing with hard realities not only in picking a facility that meets health care needs but in understanding what it means to downsize getting rid of objects can really be a struggle for seniors to get through
8457767 first i advise them to consider what they would take with them if they had only one hour to leave their homes
8457768 when seniors actually pick a place to live i encourage them to measure their rooms or to get their families to help them measure theres no point in taking more furniture than you can fit in the room
8457769 that just causes more problems and makes the move a lot tougher
8457770 but i didnt find the process of weeding out hard people talk about giving up their freedoms but what freedoms are they talking about i gave up freedoms like cleaning cooking and washing dishes now i couldnt be happier here
8457771 when you look into that empty room to which a senior is moving and start filling it up you realize its a different situation you just get numb you sort and you sort and you sort
8457772 i brought my bed my nightstand three chairs a curio cabinet and my tv
8457773 i make some recommendations to consider i try to see seniors get a good fit
8457774 to make the move as easy as possible i encourage visits to various places for tours and more than once if needed if youre moving from your original home you can often do it more slowly or first consider in home care there are a lot of waiting lists and its ok to submit your name
8457775 the no 1 mistake people make when theyre selecting a place is not being brutally honest with themselves about whether theyll be happy there
8457776 for some people assisted living isnt the right move and its better to stay at home providing their health allows but they need to make sure their home is safe for them
8457777 we try to encourage people to continue doing what they were doing when they moved here and to continue doing what they want to do we want to provide any necessary medical support or assistance our residents prefer to have medical emotional functional
8457778 our contract is a basic rental agreement no harder to understand than any other rental agreements
8457779 theyre very straightforward and were on a month to month basis
8457780 often when a person is looking into this type of living they dont really know what theyre looking for part of my job is helping them come to a conclusion about what they really want there are so many different options it can become very confusing
8457781 part of making the choice easier is how you feel when you first walk in
8457782 for a lot of people that first impression is very important
8457783 i just walked in and said this is where i want to be ive never looked back and ive never regretted my move i felt the lord had worked it all out for me i got sensible about it and my kids were really surprised
8457784 for me it was important to see that so many of the staff had been here a long time
8457785 i had been depressed and it just felt comfortable here i fell into the right spot at the right time
8457786 we allow small pets and plants can be transferred to residents rooms
8457787 i had never exercised much but when i first came to fairhaven estates they got me into exercise and i surprised myself by becoming an exercise leader
8457788 i was never an outgoing person and now they cant shut me up i also got involved in bingo
8457789 the one drawback is that you can get so close to new friends and then you lose them when they die
8457790 we lived in a house in laramie for many years but we found we eventually could not do enough around our home
8457791 we came here to be near family but we had come to a decision well before we came out here
8457792 cooking had always been my passion but as i told everyone in my family ive hung up my apron but its still fun to serve on the food committee i have to admit though that sometimes id still love to bake a custard
8457793 the gt gt gt gt gt mountain gt gt gt gt gt loomed over him
8457794 the gt gt gt gt gt gt mountain gt gt gt gt gt gt loomed over him
8457795 the gt gt gt gt gt gt gt mountain gt gt gt gt gt gt gt loomed over him
8457796 the gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt mountain gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt loomed over him
8457797 the lake beckoned him to a refershing gt gt gt gt gt gt swim
8457798 the lake beckoned him to a refershing gt gt gt gt gt gt gt swim
8457799 the lake beckoned him to a refershing gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt swim
8457800 the gt gt gt gt gt mountain gt gt gt gt gt loomed over him
8457801 the gt gt gt gt gt gt mountain gt gt gt gt gt gt loomed over him
8457802 the gt gt gt gt gt gt gt mountain gt gt gt gt gt gt gt loomed over him
8457803 the gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt mountain gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt loomed over him
8457804 the lake beckoned him to a refershing gt gt gt gt gt gt swim
8457805 the lake beckoned him to a refershing gt gt gt gt gt gt gt swim
8457806 the lake beckoned him to a refershing gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt swim
8457807 maybe he is starting to work off the bad karma of outing valerie plame
8457808 hillary did say last night that she was going to do everything she could to elect barack obama obama actuall that makes two of say
8457809 like other organizations we are feeling the economic pinch this year and are really looking to the community to help make this auction a tremendous success for our students
8457810 we can tell that theres a real economic change this year we dont have as much from merchants
8457811 this auction is important because without it we arent able to keep up with current technology and provide our teachers and students with the exceptional equipment that theyve come to rely on to meet their educational needs
8457812 pulling him and pushing him keep doing it telling people this is a sad moment and look hes not doing it
8457813 he goes i dont want to do it i dont want to do it he kept pressuring him make him do the knife thing pulling him trying to get his t shirt off pulling and pushing him he was saying just do it just do it
8457814 swung it once or twice and said i dont want to do it any more
8457815 the single most important thing i have to make clear is the choice we have in november between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for americans and help families who are struggling i will make that contrast very clearly
8457816 in terms of his speech obama has got to do two things he has to rally his base and he has to reach out to independent voters
8457817 to get people focused on the economy because that is the area of his strength but he also has to reassure people in the areas where they are not as confident of him
8457818 this democratic convention has a vibe so weird and jittery so at odds with the early thrilling fairydust feel of the obama revolution
8457819 i couldnt understand why he would organise a convention to give the clintons two nights and then diss hillary as vice president
8457820 ive seen how we can make some changes through the appropriations process
8457821 this bill is an attempt for us to address issues you face on a daily basis
8457822 it is difficult to come forward and say you need help but were perfectly set up with people who can counsel and help you
8457823 if you support this bill you need to have folks keep on top of us to make sure this passes
8457824 we want a national standard of excellence and performance for our students
8457825 we are trying to fill in the gaps so there isnt any leakage when we need to come together
8457826 the answer is to have congress put together bills to address how we can give people more choices on energy
8457827 if we do that home by home well start to impact our carbon footprint
8457828 we need to spend time on research for energy thats cleaner
8457829 when we can move big corporations through grassroots well see some big more permanent changes
8457830 a child growing up today needs to learn about their impact on the carbon footprint
8457831 we have to educate children to make better choices than we have
8457832 existe un balance entre las amenazas y las oportunidades lo que hace muy interesante trabajar en conservaci n en la provincia
8457833 consecuencia del cambio en el uso del bosque con destino a las actividades productivas como ser la ganader a la agricultura y desde hace un tiempo con una presi n a menor escala en la actualidad las plantaciones forestales de especies ex ticas pino y eucalipto
8457834 la existencia de promociones como el plan ganadero provincial que apunta a lograr un mill n de cabezas de ganado est estimulando y generando entre los peque os productores una mayor demanda de superficies para realizar esta actividad
8457835 por ejemplo la ganader a se da com nmente el proceso de
8457836 el no cumplimiento efectivo de las leyes de prohibici n de caza es alarmante la cultura misionera lleva a que los pobladores adopten la costumbre de cazar animales esto forma parte de sus h bitos cotidianos principalmente en la gente de la chacra pero a esto se suma la caza comercial la mal llamada
8457837 tambi n hemos constatado que existen algunos emprendedores inescrupulosos que favorecen la caza furtiva y tambi n hay en menor grado el conflicto por la caza de supervivencia y de b squeda de prote nas en animales por parte de las comunidades originarias y tambi n de algunos colonos que tienen basada su dieta en algunos productos de caza
8457838 es muy posible que con medidas de control de ordenamiento logremos tener una superficie de bosques bien conservados que satisfaga las necesidades para la conservaci n del todas las especies que habitan la selva misionera
8457839 tener bosques vac os implica en un futuro no tener bosques porque los animales cumplen una gran funci n desde el punto de vista de la dispersi n de las semillas de las polinizaciones adem s de cumplir un rol en el manejo de los suelos porque algunos animales hacen trabajos casi dir amos de arado para favorecer la germinaci n de las especies de esta manera tendr amos identificadas las principalescomplicaciones ambientales
8457840 si uno lograra tener un espacio en el cual pudiera habilitar actividades productivas sustentables en el tiempo el impacto no ser a tan grande teniendo en cuenta que ya el propietario habr a
8457841 no estamos haciendo en posadas as un arreglito nom s de un bachecito peque o estamos dando soluciones definitivas sabemos que el pueblo de posadas todos los d as nos mira mira nuestra acci n mira nuestra inteligencia juzga nuestra honestidad nuestra transparencia que quiere y reclama de nosotros calidad institucional y comportamiento republicano que quiere que generemos empleo sabemos que cada d a la sociedad de posadas y la sociedad de misiones nos toma examen

8457845 siempre me gusta analizar ver y reflexionar los resultados electorales y a partir de los resultados electorales ver las cosas que pudimos haber hecho bien o no tan bien f jense esta f rmula que gan por 45 000 votos al segundo que era el vicegobernador de aquel momento que le sacamos 100 000 votos a quien lleg a ser presidente de la naci n y gobernador de la provincia en esta ciudad de posadas de cada cuatro posade os solamente uno nos acompa con el voto de cada cuatro posade os solamente uno confi en nosotros sin analizar porqu hab a cinco o seis f rmulas era una sociedad dif cil de llevarle un mensaje el intendente era candidato a gobernador y hab a salido en aquel momento del espacio de la renovaci n pero la verdad es que de cada 100 posade os solamente 25 confiaron en nosotros esto hace que en cada d a del gobierno en cada acci n de gobierno en cada decisi n que tome desde el gobierno provincial piense en la ciudad de posadas en el posade o qu debemos hacer desde la renovaci n qu debemos hacer con sandra para que el pueblo de posadas nos acompa e conf e crea en nosotros y creo que vamos por el buen camino lo primero que hicimos fue tener un plan concreto para la ciudad de posadas y ese plan no se le ocurre al gobernador de la provincia sino que es un plan que se trabaja d a a d a de manera coordinada articulada y minuciosa con el intendente municipal juntos pensamos y so amos en cada acci n de gobierno lo que debemos hacer para embellecer posadas para mejorar su circulaci n las viviendas la salud el bienestar social la educaci n cada acci n que llevamos adelante mira las necesidades de esta querida ciudad de posadas
8457846 desde lo pol tico les hablo a todos ustedes que son militantes de la renovaci n en posadas necesitamos un esp ritu militante que cuente las acciones de gobierno en un pueblo como en el que yo vivo arist bulo del valle o en otro m s peque o se inaugura una escuela y es una fiesta para todo el pueblo se hacen dos cuadras de asfalto y se hace un baile porque son pueblos peque os donde cualquier obra se ve se entera todo el pueblo estas obras que hoy hacemos ac en cocomarola en cabo de hornos en cada lugar de itaemb en cada lugar de la ciudad de posadas por ah pasan desapercibidas para el 90 por ciento de la sociedad que no pasa por ac hay obras s que se ven porque son en lugares de mucha circulaci n por eso lo que yo digo es muy parecido a lo que dijo orlando franco el doctor duarte el ingeniero ros necesitamos contarle a los posade os las cosas que estamos llevando adelante

8457863 63 percent of u s voters support military action against iran if diplomacy fails
8457864 the germans oppose military action for historical and cultural reasons and the british do not want another iraq
8457865 yet the american are more open to military action especially if a diplomatic solution fails to become a reality

8458089 we have confidence because we prepared them for the situation
8458090 theyve gotten a lot of reps in scrimmages and what not so i think theyll go into the situation and be ready theyve gotten more work than most freshman have ever here so they wont be as brand new to things

8458096 basically what we have to do is erase everything from the last two years and start all over
8458097 hes graded out real well in all of our scrimmages and practices
8458098 its real surprising when you think hes only been here one year
8458099 i wouldnt compare him to rochford xavier is really athletic rochford was a guy who would beat you with speed xavier has a little more muscle on him he some speed on him too but he definitely can move people around

8458110 saya ada satu persoalan yang berkaitan dengan isi usrah kita malam ini iaitu qada dan qadar mungkin boleh menghangatkan perbincangan usrah kita
8458111 semasa kecil saya selalu berfikir fikir tentang qada dan qadar bagaimana allah menetapkan segala sesuatu tetapi dalam masa yang sama juga kita diberi untuk membuat pilihan
8458112 satu persoalan yang menarik untuk usrah kita hari ini ada sesiapa punya jawapan untuk persoalan ini
8458113 saya terfikir fikir adakah apabila manusia itu berdepan dengan keadaan untuknya membuat pilihan allah sudah menetapkan jika a pilihannya maka jalannya begini dan begini jika b maka jalannya begini dan begini dan antara a dan b itu juga sudah ada rantaian pilihan pilihan lain dalam hidupnya
8458114 maksudnya ia umpama seperti sebuah peta minda setiap cabang ada cabang yang lain dan pada cabang yang lain itu ada lagi cabang cabangnya sampai akhir hayat manusia tersebut
8458115 pertama sekali yang perlu kita tahu adalah allah itu maha mengetahui pengetahuan allah tersangat luas dalam beberapa teori sains berkaitan masa jika kita dapat menghentikan masa maka kita dapat berjalan ke zaman lampau dan juga ke masa hadapan
8458116 bukan apa cuma mahu menerangkan tentang pengetahuan allah maksudnya andai masa itu dapat dihentikan kita dapat berjalan dan melihat apa perkara atau pilihan yang akan kita buat pada masa akan datang begitulah juga dengan pengetahuan allah allah sebenarnya memang tahu apa yang akan kita buat dan apa pilihan yang kita akan pilih jadi perbincangan kita tentang qada dan qadar mesti berlandaskan ini iaitu pengetahuan allah sangat luas tiada batasan jika kita buat andaian setiap perkara itu allah sudah sediakan cabang cabang yang lain maka kita seakan menyamakan sifat allah dengan sifat manusia seakan allah tidak tahu apa yang kita akan buat pada masa akan datang
8458117 menurut apa yang saya faham kita berhak membuat pilihan sendiri tetapi allah yang akan menentukan hasil pilihan tersebut baik atau tidak
8458118 sebenarnya apa yang saya risaukan sangat kerana pada zaman sekolah dulu ada seorang rakan yang merokok mengatakan
8458119 kalau macam itu cakap pada dia suruh dia duduk diam sahaja tak perlu makan minum dan tunggu sampai mati tengok sama ada dia mati akibat merokok atau mati kelaparan kalau itulah yang dia yakin tentang qada dan qadar
8458120 sesiapa yang beramal soleh maka pahalanya bagi dirinya sendiri dan sesiapa yang mengerjakan perbuatan yang buruk maka dosanya menimpa ke atas dirinya dan tuhan kamu tidak menzalimi hamba hambanya sedikit pun
8458121 mungkin perbincangan kita ini boleh diteruskan dengan pemahaman kita tentang qada mubram dan qada muallaq
8458122 mengikut pendapat yang hak luh mahfuz menerima penghapusan dan penetapan
8458123 ada satu hadis nabi muhammad tiada apa yang dapat menolak takdir selain doa dan tiada yang dapat memanjangkan umur kecuali perbuatan yang baik

8458138 it feels great to hit a home run but im a little down
8458139 i had morneau on second base in the fourth inning with no outs and i couldnt get him over i rolled it over to short i felt like i didnt do my job then
8458140 i dont know if were pressing you can pick it either way were getting good games pitched against us or were pressing

8458144 we know that coal is the problem if australia keeps putting millions of tonnes and theres four billion tonnes of coal in that basin if we keep putting that into the world market we are driving climate change

8458146 the future of this republic is in the hands of the american voter
8458147 we had a lot of feedback from the 2004 convention that activities during the day were pretty boring but that the bloggers enjoyed hanging out together
8458148 so we thought lets create a zone where we can do that once we started down that road the interest skyrocketed
8458149 i think four years ago in boston there was nothing just a conference room with a couple of crates of beer and wifi
8458150 democratic national comittee chairman howard dean told us yesterday that we had better access than the mainstream media and i actually think thats true
8458151 were getting access to the podium to the floor there really arent many places that are off limits
8458152 a lot of people find the traditional media very stale very programmed
8458153 our readers are looking for something more than a 30 second soundbite on important issues
8458154 blogs have become important because theres been a declining trust in the mainstream media particularly in the lack of hard hitting reporting in the run up to the iraq war
8458155 that combined with the new availability of tools that allows anyone to publish and create their own audience which didnt exist before
8458156 i had to take my paid time off to come here
8458157 ive pretty much exhausted my allowance for the whole year im going to have to take unpaid leave for the rest of the year if i want to travel but fortunately my employer is supportive
8458158 preventing deforestation promoting afforestation reforestation and stopping peatland destruction are some of the cheapest and most effective ways of reducing global greenhouse gas ghg emissions
8458159 we propose the introduction of market mechanisms that can ensure investment is directed into these areas and a strategy to make this happen as quickly as possible
8458160 the prevention of deforestation and peatland destruction requires no technological development and little capital investment this method of reducing ghg emissions is dramatically cheaper than all other mitigation technologies currently available as low as us 0 1 per tonne of co2
8458161 the economics is startling if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on biofuel subsidies us 15 billion this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change in addition to this the protection of these habitats yields a plethora of valuable eco system services particularly in the poorest countries
8458162 one of the lowest hanging fruits of climate change mitigation
8458163 in the uk we can dramatically increase funding for forest and peatland projects domestically and with key partners especially in southeast asia as well as lobbying at an international level for the right global policies
8458164 all this can be done within our current budget by ending wasteful and damaging biofuel subsidies
8458165 that is where are you from georgians love it when a non georgian can speak georgian

8458169 so few floridians went to the polls on tuesday that it at least gave elections officials what amounted to a test run for new optical scan technology given the rate of scanner failure and the slowness of the new check in procedures supervisors should feel fortunate the general election is still 10 weeks away

8458184 what weve found is that every neighborhood can develop strategies to improve
8458185 its a matter of recognizing crime follows a pattern we need to recognize those patterns and make sure that we can reduce crime
8458186 if ever youre going to get recognized and adulation its going to be at the democratic national convention
8458187 there are tons of people who still have no idea what our game is and what we do but not in this setting
8458188 the shows gotten to the point where people know it and know whats going on
8458189 i think he sees himself as a truth teller and an antidote to what he sees as being artificial and false has he helped the perception of the press in general probably no he makes people in the media look buffoonish and silly and toadyish and that has an effect
8458190 the whole idea that were the beacon of integrity is ridiculous we get far more attention from you guys than we should
8458191 he writes really good jokes and everything else is a byproduct of it because he can say things they cant they treat him like a peer but hes not a peer hes a comic
8458192 does sen obama give a rose to each person to go to the next round
8458193 ive grown more comfortable with the idea its ok not to get access its ok not to get a big interview as long as we feel good about the content
8458194 its harder in that its a momentum game and weve never produced two weeks in a row on the road
8458195 the big contrast next week is probably that j lo wont be throwing an afterparty
8458196 were not going to force a joke just to be reflexively snarky and cynical
8458197 make this audience turn on us they think were always with them but were not always with anybody
8458198 bill clinton finally did what no one else has done effectively in the first two and a half days of the convention he articulated a clear rationale for supporting barack obama while also pointedly attacking mccain
8458199 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8458200 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8458201 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8458202 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8458203 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8458204 the memories you created for me have lasted a lifetime
8458205 while i was one of the highest paying coaches in the country i really missed virginia but also not coaching high school sports so i came back to accept the position of coaching and athletic director at stonewall middle school in manassas
8458206 what is good in the country but how it could be better
8458207 one of the highlights of my retirement was making two car trips across the united states over a six week period the highlight was seeing mount rushmore
8458208 i think i set an example for them as i never smoked drank or swore and i expected them to do the same
8458209 we had enrollment of maybe 300 students to wakefield high school that had more than 1 100 and were ranked as one of the top teams in the washington area when we took the field some of their players called us country bumpkins snubbed us and kidded us about being with the salvation army with our red white and blue uniforms
8458210 they were leading us 9 6 when lloyd hit me for three consecutive passes of 44 29 and 10 yards for the winning touchdown
8458211 when i did it and as a kid then i was really upset
8458212 he loved to make us run laps to make sure we were in top condition
8458213 he called us his adopted sons since he had four daughters
8458214 he was calm and quiet on the sidelines but he could really get riled up and scream at us at halftime if we were losing his favorite saying was not the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fight in the dog he always stressed dignity and sportsmanship in whatever we did i really enjoyed playing for him and still knowing him to this day
8458215 i wasnt a very good player but suren instilled in me a sense of honesty integrity and patience and i have a bunch of good memories still today he was a very special person both at gar field and stonewall where he was respected by everyone both by students and athletes he was able to relate to everyone and students admired him he didnt demand respect people just respected him
8458216 we all loved coach suren as much as he loved us
8458217 its great to meet like this and bring back old memories to remind us about our fortunes and misfortunes
8458218 jampacked her suitcase full of chicos ready to wear pantsuits
8458219 its called christmas season then return season at toys r us and thats not just two weeks long like your little rush here please throw a real challenge at me and put a smile on it
8458220 apple is not living up to some ideal of technology perfection
8458221 isn t any more likely to create technically perfect products than its competitors
8458222 look at all these great buttons that do these great things
8458223 it s an open secret that the highly touted macbook pro and leopard os will not reliably connect to wifi networks when using anything other than an apple brand airport wireless access point and even then some problems remain there have been 100s of complaints on the apple forums
8458224 the company that responds and fixes things are the ones customers will stay with
8458225 someone in a forum said vista crashed i hate vista and i hate microsoft
8458226 bring your own monitor mouse and keyboard from your pc and they all will work fine
8458227 were it not for apple constantly pushing the envelope we would all still be sitting in front of black screens with either green or amber text on them
8458228 these tortillas are delicious they are so fresh why theyre almost like pancakes
8458229 may i please have some hot tortillas and butter thank you
8458230 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8458231 but one day all of a sudden it just happened
8458232 i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing
8458233 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8458234 i didnt hear cunningham give any kind of order i didnt see him there
8458235 i thought oh no as i put two and two together
8458236 i love you grandma i am going to miss you so much im not sure how to wrap my head around it right now
8458237 well would you like to come in for a hand treatment
8458238 its awesome if we need to get our message to stick with people why not do it naked
8458239 barack obama will bring down health care costs by 2 500 for the typical family and at long last deliver affordable accessible health care for all americans
8458240 took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and half million falling into poverty and million more losing their health insurance
8458241 because barack made that choice 150 000 more children and parents have health care in illinois he fought to make that happen
8458242 john mccain has served his country with honor but his refusal to change course even in the face of the failed policies of bush cheney is reckless and will not keep us safe
8458243 sen mccain says that american troops should remain in iraq perhaps as long as they have been stationed in korea and japan as if there were no difference in history religion or culture between our friends in asia and those in the middle east
8458244 weve been in south korea weve been in japan for 60 years weve been in south korea for 50 years or so thatd be fine with me as long as americans as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed then its fine with me i hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al qaida is training recruiting and equipping and motivating people every single day
8458245 in the last two years sen obama helped pass the new gi education bill
8458246 sen mccain and the republicans have centered their answer to our vital energy needs on one solution offshore drilling sen mccain calls for it in every speech white house analysts congressional analysts and the oil industry all agree that offshore drilling wont add one drop to our energy pool for at least 10 years will it do any harm the answer is we just dont know and neither does he
8458247 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8458248 were both craps shooters and just by nature craps shooters always want to put their stack in the middle of the table
8458249 all across the world in every kind of environment and region known to man increasingly dangerous weather patterns and devastating storms are abruptly putting an end to the long running debate over whether or not climate change is real not only is it real its here and its effects are giving rise to a frighteningly new global phenomenon the man made natural disaster
8458250 the issue of climate change is one that we ignore at our own peril there may still be disputes about exactly how much were contributing to the warming of the earths atmosphere and how much is naturally occurring but what we can be scientifically certain of is that our continued use of fossil fuels is pushing us to a point of no return and unless we free ourselves from a dependence on these fossil fuels and chart a new course on energy in this country we are condemning future generations to global catastrophe
8458251 oh no scientists are all evil wicked men out to make us scared so well all turn communist
8458252 leemans and eickhout 2004 found that adaptive capacity decreases rapidly with an increasing rate of climate change their study finds that five percent of all ecosystems cannot adapt more quickly than 0 1 c per decade over time forests will be among the ecosystems to experience problems first because their ability to migrate to stay within the climate zone they are adapted to is limited if the rate is 0 3 c per decade 15 percent of ecosystems will not be able to adapt if the rate should exceed 0 4 c per decade all ecosystems will be quickly destroyed opportunistic species will dominate and the breakdown of biological material will lead to even greater emissions of co2 this will in turn increase the rate of warming
8458253 another reason for concern regional and global impacts on ecosystems for different levels of climate change
8458254 the breakup is the latest of seven major antarctic ice shelf collapses in the past 30 years after some 400 years of relative stability they include the detachment of a 1 300 square mile chunk from the lars en b ice shelf the disintegration of giant ice shelves in the prince gustav channel and the larsen inlet and the disappearance of ice shelves known as jones larsen a muller and wordie all of them corroborate temperature measurements showing that the western antarctic peninsula now known to insiders as the banana belt is warming up faster than anyplace else on earth
8458255 of course the fact that new undersea volcanoes discovered there
8458256 if you dont know if your ancestor in 3000 bc had cancer there is no way science can say you have cancer now
8458257 whats it going to be like when the temperature starts taking radical swings then ends up extreme in either direction
8458258 everyone below this line will have to be evacuated to the south everyone above this line is already dead people like us in the middle states will have to ride it out the balmy southwestern states might have a chance but new york will have tidal waves which will envelop the northeast
8458259 the breakup is the latest of seven major antarctic ice shelf collapses in the past 30 years after some 400 years of relative stability they include the detachment of a 1 300 square mile chunk from the lars en b ice shelf the disintegration of giant ice shelves in the prince gustav channel and the larsen inlet and the disappearance of ice shelves known as jones larsen a muller and wordie all of them corroborate temperature measurements showing that the western antarctic peninsula now known to insiders as the banana belt is warming up faster than anyplace else on earth
8458260 i just dont think that humans are to blame for the change in our climate
8458261 i dont believe anything our mainstream media and government officials tell us anymore
8458262 the breakup is the latest of seven major antarctic ice shelf collapses in the past 30 years after some 400 years of relative stability they include the detachment of a 1 300 square mile chunk from the lars en b ice shelf the disintegration of giant ice shelves in the prince gustav channel and the larsen inlet and the disappearance of ice shelves known as jones larsen a muller and wordie all of them corroborate temperature measurements showing that the western antarctic peninsula now known to insiders as the banana belt is warming up faster than anyplace else on earth
8458263 the results for temperature and pressure suggest that the arctic may be a temporally leading indicator of greenhouse driven changes despite its large natural variability
8458264 now its time to see how much progress weve made in practice and how well the new players and veterans have come together as a team our three early season weekend tournaments will give us an opportunity to further develop team chemistry and prepare us for a challenging 20 match conference schedule
8458265 i didnt hear cunningham give any kind of order i didnt see him there
8458266 i thought oh no as i put two and two together
8458267 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
8458268 only a few couples have requested we change the menu due to environmental concerns
8458269 it is very difficult to change traditional concepts and we can only do it slowly
8458270 at this point in time johore is a major problem area and it also coincides with the durian season and i know many singaporeans go to durian plantations so if you do i think you should just protect yourself mosquito repellents may help
8458271 are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8458272 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8458273 let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8458274 guys want to get into your pants they will do anything to be allowed into your pants take you on dates keep dating you compliment you become your best friend just to get into your pants
8458275 get this one iran is changing its cars to run on
8458276 theyre doing this to use less oil and sell it for a 120 a barrel we can switch our cars to natural gas and stop sending our dollars to foreign countries
8458277 it is now and it probably always has been the case that hes the best speechwriter in the group
8458278 everything ive learned in my eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8458279 and we have them for the undecideds too one shoes a donkey the other one an elephant
8458280 what you didnt hear is her acclaim for john mccain
8458281 a man she knows is prepared to lead as our next president
8458282 please join the constantly growing group of supporters of all party affiliations who say john mccain is ready to lead
8458283 beginning september 1st our campaign is limited in the amount of money we can spend while senator obama will spend whatever he wants to defeat us
8458284 they are shameless in the way they care only about themselves they are like clouds blowing over dry land without giving rain promising much but producing nothing they are like trees without fruit at harvest time they are not only dead but doubly dead for they have been pulled out by the roots they are like wild waves of the sea churning up the dirty foam of their shameful deeds they are wandering stars heading for everlasting gloom and darkness
8458285 you have this paper with provocative conclusions on multiracial identity that was first written in july 2005 being published in this final version in august 2008
8458286 hmm why is this issue suddenly on the national horizon oh right the presidential campaign its hard not to wonder whether theres a larger agenda
8458287 i dont know what their objective was but this is a paper with a surprising number of problems
8458288 theres so much more going on here than what theyre saying that the decisions they make look capricious at a minimum
8458289 among scholars who study multiracial identity i dont think any of us believe in that hypothesis
8458290 its the most controversial take its basically the reason used to keep interracial marriages illegal until the 1960s at best we might use it as a straw man
8458291 you have this assumption that blacks are one monolithic population whites are another monolithic population and multiracials are the monolithic blending between them
8458292 you may be a little slow to acquire language but once you do you find it easier to understand syntax and pronunciation for other languages as well straddling cultures may add risks but if we can address those risks it flips over into a strength
8458293 were talking about mixed identities in the public arena like never before
8458294 over the last 10 years youve had a new prominence of people who identify in fluid and dynamic ways barack obama being just one example
8458295 breakfast is very different they really have a love of bread
8458296 they surround the bull horned protesters in a massive show of force
8458297 there are a number of mccain supporters trying to lure disaffected hillary supporters to events claiming to honor her but sponsored by mccain as shown at the bottom of their flyers
8458298 but there is no way the dems would want a show where a character
8458299 sings if thats being red you can call me pinko
8458300 im sorry my boyfriend swallowed a candle in santa barbara
8458301 the car was here and i was here and the bread delivery truck was backing up out of this driveway and so it is evident that the right of way clearly belonged to me
8458302 in my big gas guzzler i do not have to attend to the regulations of ordinary humans
8458303 the only people benefiting from the legal wrangling are the attorneys

8458322 and second im here to warm up the crowd for joe biden
8458323 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8458324 barack obama is ready to lead and restore american leadership in the world
8458325 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8458326 the republicans will nominate a good man who served his country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam he loves his country every bit as much as we all do as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues
8458327 but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years a philosophy we never had a real chance to see in action until 2001 when the republicans finally gained control of both the white house and congress
8458328 my fellow democrats 16 years ago you gave me the profound honor to lead our party to victory and to lead our nation to a new era of peace and broadly shared prosperity together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8458329 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8458330 hes kind of that unusual mix of somebody who has been in washington forever but hes never really been fully caught up in the whole insider washington game
8458331 i remember when i first started to run here i was the high tech guy from northern virginia spending enormous amounts of time in south side and southwest virginia
8458332 there was at first a suspicion hey is this guy the real deal or is it just the equivalent of a political drive by and i think with time people understood this is something im passionate about
8458333 somebody who has already been caricatured by the media so much and misrepresented
8458334 while sen obama may not close the deal with folks its not like sen mccain has either
8458335 if you think back to the clinton 92 campaign you may not have known all of the economic policies but you knew he was going to come out and focus on the economy you knew there were ideas about national service there were a couple of takeaways and i think this notion of driving down gas prices grappling with kids going to college the question of particularly in these communities how do you not have to move away to find a world class job is all the prosperity going to be in our major metropolitan areas i think hes gotta connect that
8458336 one of the things i talk about it trying to build a bipartisan group of radical centrists that could say no to both ends and people say ahhh warner youre crazy that cant happen it just wont happen i dont accept it
8458337 youre basically saying that if you accept that then short of a massive majority from one party or the other youre talking about continuing institutional gridlock and youre basically saying the senates going to be a failed institution thats not where i want to go work
8458338 people are just beginning to learn that cutting their meat consumption has a big impact on global warming
8458339 people think that they have to go out and buy a new car or take a drastic step like that but the best thing they can do is as simple as changing their diet
8458340 i never heard of it before but is seems like a good idea
8458341 there are a lot of difference things that we should tax like gas i dont know if meat is one of them
8458342 when i realized i was supporting that with my meals i couldnt sit down to a meal then i learned the health benefits
8458343 the amount of methane released by a cow each day is amazing
8458344 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8458345 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8458346 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
8458347 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8458348 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
8458349 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
8458350 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
8458351 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
8458352 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
8458353 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
8458354 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
8458355 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
8458356 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
8458357 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
8458358 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
8458359 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
8458360 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
8458361 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
8458362 get this one iran is changing its cars to run on
8458363 theyre doing this to use less oil and sell it for a 120 a barrel we can switch our cars to natural gas and stop sending our dollars to foreign countries
8458364 we obviously believed that the defendant deserved the death penalty for the tremendous pain and suffering he caused the victims and their families
8458365 this was an old scheme through which some private sectors seized the nations wealth without a drop of sweat
8458366 farmers can use these lands because of the way indians have traditionally used the land in harmony with the environment
8458367 one way or the other there must be a political constitution that guarantees and secures the advances made by the government
8458368 to affirm that there is an absolute constitutional protection of life in gestation would lead to the violation of the fundamental rights of women
8458369 despite all of the obstacles and the conscientious objections the service is working
8458370 doctors nurses and social workers have lived up to the commitment with a lot of generosity
8458371 we have the right to choose about our body but we dont have the right to end the life of a human being
8458372 they are not thinking about the psychological damage that the girls who have abortions go through
8458373 would be a historic ruling that recognizes the importance of this problem from the point of view of public health and womens rights
8458374 as soon as the latter came out of my mouth my right arm was twisted violently behind my back and i was informed that i was being escorted out of the stadium a second officer then joined in and twisted my left arm also in an excessively forceful manner behind my back
8458375 we got it for cheap vol 3 hosted by dj drama
8458376 holy lord its over oh god we have done no wrong so we go where we belong to the neverending dream but for those who lived in sin
8458377 internet even with cheaper gas labor day trips will drop nashville tennessean collaboration by eventus930 the company we represent would like to
8458378 internet even with cheaper gas labor day trips will drop nashville tennessean collaboration by eventus930 the company we represent would like to
8458379 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8458380 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8458381 this offer applies to the first 200 whose applications to set up stalls during the fasting month have been approved
8458382 those who are interested and fulfil the requirements can contact the sectoral section at the state economic development unit or my office
8458383 the state governments restructuring of the water industry involves syabas syabas will remain in the water industry and though the shareholders may be different the duties of the company remain the same

8458386 the line up was great but if only it wasnt for the fat guy who burped juice on my shoe
8458387 she said they will be moving on since holly is hefs main girlfriend
8458388 holly is taking a bigger role in the company directing pictorials
8458389 this is an exciting development which completes another important piece of the jig saw in understanding how we might use gene therapy to eventually restore hearing loss
8458390 together with the very positive early signs from other potential treatments such as stem cell therapies it is no longer just a pipe dream to talk about cell and drug based solutions to restore hearing there is a long way to go but the journey towards new treatments is certainly under way
8458391 there is no present plan for tests in humans the next step is to restore hearing in a deaf mouse
8458392 only after this can we start experiments that will teach us if the approach might work in humans so there is an enormous amount of work to do
8458393 the exciting news for those of us with hearing loss and tinnitus ringing in the ears is that we now have hope of having our hearing restored someday
8458394 i was born hearing and began to lose my hearing in grade school
8458395 my hearing loss is progressive so i need to think about other options in the very near future
8458396 i have never considered self experimentation to treat my hearing loss i hope to contribute to an effort that helps define suitable therapies which may one day be offered in the clinic thats the right way to go about this
8458397 were really pleased that the court agreed with our position it shows that the government has to be responsive to the public that they serve
8458398 its premature to say what our next steps might be
8458399 it makes no more sense to be offended at the site of a nude human than it does to be offended at the sight of a redwood tree
8458400 is a former 1 from superstar carrie underwood earlier this year
8458401 by kenny chesney these songs are landmark songs from the past couple years having become some of the most successful 1 hits in this projects time frame of song selections
8458402 from chris cagle was added in along with other more popular top 10 hits like
8458403 by luke bryan it is in this aspect of the album that we some very wise inclusions as some of the most popular overlooked artists and some more popular sensational breakthroughs get their chance at bragging about being included with the likes of chesney and george in a collection such as this
8458404 was added in after its slightly less popular run over her more memorable hit
8458405 the threat of a new ice age must now stand alongside nuclear war as a likely source of wholesale death and misery for mankind
8458406 the cooling since 1940 has been large enough and consistent enough that it will not soon be reversed
8458407 in the 1970s hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death
8458408 if i were a gambler i would take even money that england will not exist in the year 2000
8458409 by 2000 they americans will if permitted be using all of them
8458410 the world as we know it will likely be ruined by the year 2000
8458411 civilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind
8458412 somewhere between 75 and 85 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct
8458413 take it from me obama is okay we can trust this guy you can support him for the same reasons that you supported me
8458414 experience without judgment isnt worth much john mccain proves that with his unwavering support for the policies of george bush
8458415 bill clinton was the new kid on the block when he ran for president but with his priorities in order he set the nation back on the right track so will barack obama
8458416 its all about defining your riding style and crafting the line that suits you
8458417 stoked leaves well worn resorts behind and gives players absolute freedom to ride wherever they want and trick off of anything they can find in some of the most famous backcountry locations the world has to offer gameplay is focused on style and finesse not button mashing destineer and bongfish have created a game that looks and plays like a snowboarding movie
8458418 developing a snowboard video game has always been a dream of mine there are endless synergies between a snowboard film production and a game developer that were just waiting to be activated bongfish and destineer have realized this potential and have shown a real passion for snowboarding and together weve worked to bring snowboarding luminaries from across the planet together for this project
8458419 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden onto hard pressed british families and businesses
8458420 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8458421 the government is talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8458422 the government is on the verge of making a massive costly and hugely damaging mistake that will destabilise the criminal justice system for years to come
8458423 giant us style prisons may be easier to build but all the evidence here and abroad says the price we would pay in running them and in higher re offending rates is far too high if ministers want prisons to be focused on rehabilitation rather than warehousing offenders until they are released then it is not too late to make these plans disappear as fast as they appeared
8458424 verification status not verified last attempt aug 27 2008 weve detected that your 404 file not found error page returns a status of 200 success in the header
8458425 so we need to keep going for barack obama all the way to the white house
8458426 you might wonder what obama was doing working with a character like this
8458427 system and method for forming cell by using distributed antennas in wimax mobile communication system
8458428 we were keeping our fingers crossed that our projections were correct and that we would do well
8458429 we have a lot of good educators and the results are a testament to their hard work
8458430 although we will continue to strive to meet the goals of no child left behind we believe that preparing our students for life after high school and success in our ever diversifying global community is a primary responsibility
8458431 we saw a great jump in math achievement so were very happy with that
8458432 if voters are willing to stand at polls for countless hours in the rain as many did in ohio then i should surely stand up for them here in the halls of congress this objection does not have at its root the hope or even the hint of overturning the victory of the president but it is a necessary timely and appropriate opportunity to review and remedy the most precious process in our democracy
8458433 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8458434 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8458435 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8458436 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8458437 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8458438 taking a live feed and redistributing that is one thing but taking a live feed cutting it slicing it dicing it and sending it back to the park so an umpire can see it all in a relatively short period of time is frankly a skill set that we needed to develop
8458439 just as long as it puts the yankees and or red sox into the playoffs
8458440 studio 8 is the best all round web design package on the market it runs under both windows and os x highly recommended
8458441 bottom line for creating polished and cutting edge online and mobile content the innovative macromedia studio 8 is in a league of its own
8458442 and second im here to warm up the crowd for joe biden
8458443 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8458444 barack obama is ready to lead and restore american leadership in the world
8458445 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8458446 the republicans will nominate a good man who served his country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam he loves his country every bit as much as we all do as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues
8458447 but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years a philosophy we never had a real chance to see in action until 2001 when the republicans finally gained control of both the white house and congress
8458448 my fellow democrats 16 years ago you gave me the profound honor to lead our party to victory and to lead our nation to a new era of peace and broadly shared prosperity together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8458449 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8458450 he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8458451 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8458452 it surprised us and once in a while it is kind of fun to be surprised on the upside
8458453 barack obama will bring down health care costs by 2 500 for the typical family and at long last deliver affordable accessible health care for all americans
8458454 took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and half million falling into poverty and million more losing their health insurance
8458455 because barack made that choice 150 000 more children and parents have health care in illinois he fought to make that happen
8458456 john mccain has served his country with honor but his refusal to change course even in the face of the failed policies of bush cheney is reckless and will not keep us safe
8458457 sen mccain says that american troops should remain in iraq perhaps as long as they have been stationed in korea and japan as if there were no difference in history religion or culture between our friends in asia and those in the middle east
8458458 weve been in south korea weve been in japan for 60 years weve been in south korea for 50 years or so thatd be fine with me as long as americans as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed then its fine with me i hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al qaida is training recruiting and equipping and motivating people every single day
8458459 in the last two years sen obama helped pass the new gi education bill
8458460 sen mccain and the republicans have centered their answer to our vital energy needs on one solution offshore drilling sen mccain calls for it in every speech white house analysts congressional analysts and the oil industry all agree that offshore drilling wont add one drop to our energy pool for at least 10 years will it do any harm the answer is we just dont know and neither does he
8458461 dont contact people you dont know they dont like it and neither to we
8458462 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
8458463 semua persiapan mulai dari perangkat keras seperti komputer mesin cetak paspor mesin sidik jari wajah dan perlengkapan lainnya sudah ada dan siap untuk dioperasikan begitu juga dengan perangkat lunaknya seperti jaringan komputersasi ke pusat telah diaktifkan
8458464 semua pegawai sesuai dengan tugasnya masing masing red sudah diberikan pelatihan sebelumnya jadi untuk tenaga yang akan mengoperasikan sistem e pasport ini juga sudah siap
8458465 memang harapan kami bisa langsung berjalan lancar namun karena masih tahap awal dan baru diberlakukan pastinya akan ada kesalahan kesalahan inilah yang nantinya akan dibenahi namun ini tidak akan lama minimal dalam dua minggu ke depan semua sudah bisa berjalan dengan baik dan lancar
8458466 bahkan data data orang yang sudah pernah membuat paspor sebelumnya telah tercatat di imigrasi pusat sehingga ketahuan sekali bagi warga yang sudah pernah membuat paspor namun dirinya ingin membuat paspor lagi pasport ganda dengan tujuan yang berbeda
8458467 jika orang yang ingin membuat pasport tersebut bohong belum pernah membuat paspor namun sebetulnya sudah pernah maka surat permohonannya yang dikirim ke pusat nantinya akan ditolak dan dikembalikan karena di pusat setelah dicocokkan ternyata si pemohon sudah terdata pernah membuat paspor sebelumnya
8458468 i never would have been born if my dad hadnt have dropped out of university and met my mum at work
8458469 my mum and i would never have been born if my nana had moved to canada as planned because she wouldnt have met my taid
8458470 judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers
8458471 every day now i learn something new about candidate mccain to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick look at candidate mccain and senator mccain
8458472 who can we trust to keep america safe barack obama
8458473 mccain bush republicans have been wrong again and again they cant win on the issues so they go into the gutter
8458474 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment
8458475 but even kate moss doesnt live up to the image
8458476 statuephilia will bring together a group of modern sculptors all of whom have prowled through the corridors and display cabinets of the british museum in their formative years looking at sculpture and feeling its unmatched international potency
8458477 the british museum helped to make these artists what they are now they are seeking to return the favour
8458478 twelve houses between them two rich guys its almost like shooting fish in a bucket
8458479 watch therefore for you do not know on what day you lord is coming
8458480 therefore you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect
8458481 blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing
8458482 yes lord i already prepare well for seeing you take me to your heaven
8458483 no lord i have not prepare well for it dont put in into the weep and gnash place
8458484 how could someone do triathlons and still be this fat
8458485 a scheme for reducing the effects of pa non linearity in wireless ofdma reverse links
8458486 oh so you dont really teach anything you just let the kids play all day
8458487 its hillary clinton as a write in candidate in november obama is unacceptable and mccain while serving our country and suffering for it has policies amp thinking that are too rigid and old fashioned its hillary or no one
8458488 i think ronald reagan changed the trajectory of america in a way that richard nixon did not and in a way that bill clinton did not
8458489 and now there are reports that clinton bill that is plans on skipping obamas historic speech tomorrow at invesco field
8458490 oh she didnt say that hes ready to be commander in chief
8458491 the funny thing is shed be a nobody without bill that man deserves a cigar
8458492 i hope she at least took the time and effort to school michelle obama on the duties of a first lady
8458493 i cant listen to her at all her voice loosens my fillings
8458494 i thought michelle was going to explode she tried to look happy but the dislike was apparent
8458495 michelle always has that look on her face it looks like she bit a bitter lemon
8458496 instead of pointing to the success of the thousands of black americans who have worked to achieve their own american dreams and using his campaign victory as the presumptive democratic candidate for president as a sign of what americans of any race can do he continues to play to the victim thinking mentality its that same thinking that has kept far too many black americans enslaved to affirmative action and its premise that they cant succeed without it the black harvard sociologist orlando patterson is quoted in larry elders the ten things you cant say in america the sociological truths are that america while still flawed in its race relations is now the least racist white majority society in the world has a better record of legal protection of minorities than any other society white or black offers more opportunities to a greater number of black persons than any other society including all those of africa voting for or against someone because of the color of his skin is a form of racism that should be un american the first black president of the united states should earn it the old fashioned way by combining experience leadership acumen with compelling policy priorities that excite the electorate barack obamas lack of proven leadership experience his inconsistent policy stands and non existent legislative track record leaves much to be desired as a president
8458497 they have beaten me they have stripped me naked they have robbed me of my dignity but its alright i shall get up and fight back again and again
8458498 anak melayu anak saya anak cina anak saya anak india anak saya
8458499 the probability of what we see occuring by chance is 5 or less
8458500 there is no association between religion and ethnicity any association seen is due to chance alone
8458501 there is a statistically significant association between religion and ethnicity
8458502 there is no difference between mean heights of chinese and mean heights of japanese any difference seen is due to chance alone
8458503 there is a difference between mean heights of chinese and mean heights of japanese
8458504 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8458505 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8458506 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november

8458509 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8458510 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8458511 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run

8458533 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8458534 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8458535 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama

8458537 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8458538 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8458539 he will choose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort
8458540 in spite of all the evidence their candidate is promising more of the same
8458541 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8458542 have given him his historic chance will drive him as president to give all americans regardless of race religion gender sexual orientation or disability their chance to build a decent life and to show our humanity as well as our strength to the world

8458546 i went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago we described this to intelligence agencies and to the national security council in detail
8458547 we applaud the republican party and especially the members of the platform committee representing grassroots pro life republicans across the country for making such a strong and unequivocal stand supporting life at all stages
8458548 the work of the platform committee makes clear in no uncertain terms that the republican party is the pro life party

8458628 hillary couldnt have said it better none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is our one shot so lets roll up our sleeves
8458629 i was dissatisfied with the ruling of the court with regard to our demand that our investigation and prosecution be ended but theres a key point in that decision of the court that theres no incriminating evidence its just giving way to the prosecution to continue investigating as it wishes the prosecution has that much prerogative to continue its investigation with the police even without the presence of an investigating judge
8458630 mahabang panahon na ang dumaan bago ako naaresto noong 2007 ngayon napatunayan sa court na walang evidence and they prosecution got more than more time to do the investigation so meron silang plus na one year by september yong malaking abuso sa akin eh yong pang iipit na walang pinangbabatayan so may basis kami by september to complain and make a demand to end the investigation
8458631 sabi nga mga twelve boxes ang sinauli pero para sa lahat yon sa akin parang three boxes para sa akin eh kulang pa yon marami pang kulang sa akin me hinihintay pa akong isang box ng mga cds ah no hindi cds kundi diskettes at ilang pang files na hinihintay ko
8458632 nearly everything confiscated during the raids of aug 28 last year sinasauli na konti na lang natitira and only a few days ago things taken were returned and only the remaining few materials shall be returned next time so we think that the prosecution is moving already towards the closing of the case because of the continuing lack of evidence
8458633 of course we dont have word now but its our estimate that it prosecution cant find it seems that it hasnt found any evidence otherwise due notice would have been given the court and to me as suspect
8458634 well when it comes in september and there will be no finding of incriminating evidence then it will be good the lack of incriminating evidence will be a good basis for demanding the termination of the case because you know the passage of more than one year would mean that the prosecution went into the arrest operations of aug 28 without any basis not withstanding the fact that it did not prepare for the case well before aug 28 2007 he had one more year to investigate and it has nothing

8458662 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8458663 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8458664 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8458665 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8458771 well they ought to do this they ought to do that
8458772 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8458773 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8458774 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8458775 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8458776 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8458777 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8458778 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8458779 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8458780 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8458781 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8458782 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8458783 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8458784 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8458785 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8458786 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8458787 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
8458788 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
8458789 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
8458790 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
8458791 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8458792 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8458793 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
8458794 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8458795 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8458796 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
8458797 in the most recent poll i am ahead by a commanding 1 percent
8458798 right now we are holding a majority by the skin of joe liebermans teeth
8458799 and president obama is going to need a working majority in the senate
8458800 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
8458801 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
8458802 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
8458803 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
8458804 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8458805 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8458806 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8458807 the american people are dumb enough to give the republicans another shot
8458808 encourage users to analyze comment on and even challenge washingtonpost coms articles
8458809 everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler
8458810 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8458811 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8458812 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8458813 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8458814 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8458815 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8458816 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8458817 no comics professional in the 1950s could have envisioned that the industry would spawn a knock off showbiz stuffed with quasi celebrity
8458818 the most famous celebrity in the world me is that the best lie the republicans could come up with or do they have to resort to that sort of thing because their politics are even emptier than that ad is
8458819 well sure cindy mccains a rich drug addict who looted her own charity to supply medicine to africa to feed her own addiction and she got off with a slap on the wrist and everyone chuckling about what a minx she is if michelle obama had done that shed still be doing time thats the america cindy mccains proud of
8458820 mumble mumble china but we got the most medals overall mumble mumble
8458821 seriously its funny beyond bel hmmm what its not a parody
8458822 to mislead his colleagues and the public on drug policy where police prosecutors and dea officials got the opportunity to speak while opponents were kept out
8458823 pick a drug law you dont like from the last 25 years and thank senator biden
8458824 each of the myths upon which we based the sentencing disparity has since been dispelled or altered
8458825 it was never a matter of mr sandlin not accepting responsibility for what hed done
8458826 technically he was eligible for probation hes never even had a traffic ticket under the circumstances what did he have to lose by rolling the dice
8458827 ultimately his motives were noble he didnt want to put his kids and family through the rigors of the trial
8458828 gerrard will have an operation tomorrow on a groin problem we knew this would happen he had a problem and now he will have an operation and he will be out for 10 or 15 days its not a big problem but he had pain and it was difficult
8458829 he was playing with pain before and he kept going today because he knew he was going to see the surgeon tomorrow its not serious its a minor operation but we needed to do it
8458830 we knew it would be difficult because they played well in the first game and we had to work really hard until the end for me the most positive thing is we played a little bit better against a good team who are sharp now we scored right at the end that showed the team was working really hard
8458831 when you play these kind of games the other team is playing and training just thinking about this game but we have been bringing in players from things like the olympic games and now we can start working as a group
8458832 when you change risk management people it has to be viewed as recognizing problems so it is mildly positive
8458833 odds of treasury stepping in and dealing with fannie mae and freddie mac before the end of this year have been considerably diminished
8458834 its a little of a race between the profits on the portfolios and the losses they are taking on defaults and mark to market write downs
8458835 still it will become increasingly difficult for policy makers to ignore the gse situation as risks of further contraction in the mortgage market are as unpalatable as a high profile bailout
8458836 we transport both gas and diesel so im going to get diesel
8458837 im not going to wait here all day and come away empty handed
8458838 i had been on vacation for a week so i caught up on reading newspapers
8458839 if we dont have adequate supply to match up with demand then we encounter some short term outages
8458840 it may require fuel tanker drivers to go farther to get it
8458841 we are meeting our planned commitment to deliver products to the magellan line
8458842 were being told demand is outstripping supply at this time
8458843 many of us are having a hard time believing that
8458844 were being told that the next six to eight weeks could be touch and go from our sources
8458845 at this point in time were kind of taking a wait and see approach
8458846 while the alleged presence of weapons in the kalma camp is a real security concern for the government of sudan authorities the actions taken to address it are a clear violation of the darfur peace agreement
8458847 unamid strongly condemns the excessive disproportionate use of lethal force by the government of sudan security forces against civilians which violated their human rights and resulted in unacceptable casualties
8458848 that the presence of weapons voids the status of idp camps granted to them by international humanitarian law and exhorts the idp community and its leaders and representatives to ensure that their camps are and remain weapons free zones
8458849 gt report to the security council on the work of unamid published today secretary general ban ki moon voiced deep concern at the continuing violence across darfur and its humanitarian consequences for the civilian population
8458850 i urge all parties to recognize the urgent need to end the suffering of innocent civilians and immediately commit themselves to an unconditional ceasefire
8458851 cannot be a substitute for a political process ultimately the crisis in darfur can be resolved only through political negotiations and a comprehensive and inclusive peace agreement
8458852 he voted 19 times against the minimum wage for people struggling just to make it to the next day thats not change thats more of the same
8458853 everything i learned in my 8 years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8458854 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than the example of our power
8458855 i will never forget the parents of children with autism and other serious conditions who told me on the campaign trial that they couldnt afford healthcare and couldnt qualify for their children for medicade unless the quit work and starved or got a divorce are these the family values the republicans are so proud of
8458856 16 years ago you gave me the profound honor to lead our nation to peace and broad prosperity where the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work on 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8458857 the situation at our channel is about to blow up
8458858 its okay to get blown out by roger federer but not by a ball basher in andy roddick
8458859 ohhh it is just grampa santoro on his farewell tour and as he can t win games on his own i better start gifting some points here and there
8458860 i have something to show you and youll laugh so hard
8458861 we have a massive infrastructure here with 300 hectares of land and 800 to a 1000 personnel on site
8458862 to have students moved outside the airport the city boundaries is a question i cant really answer
8458863 airports in built up suburban areas are common moorabbin bankstown in sydney archerfield in brisbane and parafield in adelaide and they are also big training airports
8458864 mid air collisions are extremely rare theres not an issue of safety
8458865 local residents shouldnt be concerned about these sort of things happening frequently they dont

8458867 mark priestley was a tremendous young person loved and respected by his fellow all saints cast members and crew
8458868 mark was such a brilliant artist his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile
8458869 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8458870 we never know what any actors are going through we all see got it all together actors on tv we dont know what their real life is all about
8458871 my thoughts and prays are with marks family and friends he will be sorely missed my many
8458872 bless you for giving us such enjoyment in watching you blossom in front of our eyes its a shame you arent with us anymore
8458873 mark priestley was a tremendous young person loved and respected by his fellow all saints cast members and crew
8458874 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8458875 theres no way a parent today can compare like schools with like schools
8458876 theres nothing available to the national government today that enables us to see across the nation on a comparable system which schools are falling behind and need extra resources
8458877 we want transparency and we are prepared to bring new and extra resources to the table to make a difference to disadvantaged schools and to make a difference on teacher quality
8458878 theres no point in the world with comparing a rich school on sydneys north shore with elizabeth north in south australia and how the school is going there
8458879 our whole plan is to analyse student population and compare like schools with like schools
8458880 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations
8458881 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8458882 were not only going to take the best practice there were going to take extra resources there
8458883 were pledging a school like that with difficulties would get resources of 500 000 a year extra to make a difference and to bring that school up to standard

8458890 joint transmission of control and data in sc ofdma or dft spread ofdma system
8458891 it was when hillary and bill came and it was like 90 to 100 degrees i just handed people water and stuff i was wearing a gore t shirt
8458892 is just helping people get set up in the morning
8458893 it was pretty cool seeing ted kennedy and michelle obama i just liked how many people had their signs up
8458894 he was put to work hed go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8458895 american people had their first date with michelle obama and it was matched in another way by another generation by ted kennedy
8458896 spanned the generations to the way people were inspired and motivated by john kennedy those of us who were their age at one time had a similar opportunity to be motivated by change
8458897 ted kennedy inspired us one more time and michelle obama is modeling that change it was an unusual historic event and ive never been prouder to be a democrat in my life
8458898 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8458899 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8458900 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8458901 the long answer is well ive lived in the philly area for most of my life and i know it well maybe too well so i figure nows my chance to get to know somewhere else l a is sunny and theres good vegetarian food
8458902 not only because people seemed to really appreciate it but because talking to farmers was like some kind of therapy so nice and relaxing made me want to quit journalism and become a farmer
8458903 im hoping california is like one big headhouse market everywhere you look fruits and veggies even if its not that way im going to have a little yard out there and i plan to start a garden so i will send you a tomato and you can decide
8458904 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8458905 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8458906 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8458907 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8458908 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8458909 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8458910 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8458911 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8458912 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8458913 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8458914 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8458915 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8458916 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8458917 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8458918 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8458919 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8458920 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8458921 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8458922 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8458923 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8458924 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8458925 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8458926 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8458927 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8458928 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8458929 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8458930 the next six months are going to tell the story
8458931 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8458932 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8458933 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8458934 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8458935 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8458936 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8458937 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8458938 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8458939 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8458940 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8458941 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8458942 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8458943 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8458944 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8458945 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments

8458969 dan feels helpless when a pre wedding gag organised by his brother goes wrong and dan finds himself tied to a tree while a horrific accident occurs right in front of him extricating himself from his bonds dan does his best to keep the casualties alive and calm while he waits for help
8458970 a woman has been badly injured and her husbands panic complicates dans attempts to assess and administer first aid to her
8458971 on arrival in the ed dan pitches in to help while the rest of the all saints team deal with the casualties
8458972 meanwhile erica has been notified of whats happened and races into the ed to ensure her groom is okay its obvious hes not and when dan elects to postpone the wedding the race is on to change his mind about getting married
8458973 will the days events be too difficult for him to overcome or will love prevail
8458974 the open source development model is unique end users not only give feedback on the software theyre a fundamental and critical part of the community submitting patches and developing new features themselves
8458975 before this event however there was no neutral forum that would advance and optimize this collaboration the end user summit will fill this gap and accelerate problem solving for linux
8458976 east harlem for sale a youth perspective on how gentrification is changing the community
8458977 i didnt read it nor would i my friends called me and said oh she said this and this tori and i were friends but along the way people grow in different directions i did my thing she did her thing and that
8458978 the status of the man is such that he has small cut on his forehead which will require stitching and medical attention
8458979 he has been taken by ambulance to auckland hospital and after an assessment hell be safely transported home
8458980 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8458981 this is a very large man he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8458982 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8458983 these are not the yobbos that the police are interested in
8458984 they dont cause any of the problems that initiated this unfortunate policy in the first place
8458985 after 3am with only three police officers means there must be less problems than before 3am
8458986 it doesnt take a loosely organized group of conspirators to weigh depressingly upon the mechanism of price discovery coming out of the nymex comex futures exchange all it takes is for the participants who have common sense to gain the upper hand over those who stubbornly dont have any
8458987 the futures contracts are put forth by the exchange as if they were actual contracts between counterparties looking to actually buy sell the corresponding quantities of metal at their contracts snapshot price
8458988 but everyone with common sense knows that the physical element of the contract is just a pretense and that after paying a simple margin to play the game for a brief while the vast majority of these contracts will be settled with cash
8458989 those with common sense and a memory of the hunt brothers experience nearly 30 years ago know that there is no meat on the bones of these contracts and when crunch time arrives default is the institutionalized and well worn path of least resistance
8458990 it doesnt take conspiratorial planning for a preponderance of participants to know enough either to steer clear of these contracts or to short the hell out of them at such times as may be deemed advantageous
8458991 and on the other side of the equation are the longs the very few who havent yet realized that nothing materially is ever going to be coming out of those contracts except perhaps some short term cash if they can trade in and out nimbly enough
8458992 but in the longer term everyone with common sense understands the pretense and therefore knows that the contract is effectively rubbish thus ever and always giving the shorters the upper hand when they square off at the exchange against the addle headed longs who stand to gain nothing material out of their position in the overall equation
8458993 this situation reminds me of a story shared by a friend of mine who himself is a natural born wheeler dealer
8458994 a chip off the old block if ever there was one if the kid could wrap his mind around the structure of a gold futures contract im sure hed know exactly what to do with that too
8458995 for those who insist on the conspiracy story i guess my point is that you can sleep extra soundly knowing that there is a wider population of potential co conspirators that you can add to your list
8458996 the bottom line take advantage of the physical market for as long as the scarce metal is still available at the deeply discounted prices of its exchange traded papery derivatives
8458997 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8458998 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8458999 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8459000 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8459001 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8459002 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8459003 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8459004 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8459005 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8459006 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8459007 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8459008 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8459009 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8459010 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8459011 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8459012 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8459013 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8459014 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8459015 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8459016 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8459017 really youre focused youre listening and getting a feel for the hall you havent been there you dont quite have that same feel as if youd been there for a few hours even
8459018 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8459019 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8459020 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8459021 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8459022 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8459023 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8459024 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8459025 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8459026 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8459027 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8459028 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8459029 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8459030 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8459031 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8459032 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8459033 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8459034 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8459035 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8459036 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8459037 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8459038 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8459039 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8459040 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8459041 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8459042 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8459043 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8459044 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8459045 our enemies are innovative and resourceful and so are we they never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people and neither do we
8459046 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practice their love with women all across this country
8459047 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
8459048 theres an old saying in tennessee i know its in texas probably in tennessee that says fool me once shame on shame on you fool me you cant get fooled again
8459049 so long as im the president my measure of success is victory and success
8459050 the question is who ought to make that decision the congress or the commanders and as you know my position is clear im a commander guy
8459051 as yesterdays positive report card shows childrens do learn when standards are high and results are measured
8459052 more than two decades later it is hard to imagine the revolutionary war coming out any other way
8459053 im going to try to see if i can remember as much to make it sound like im smart on the subject
8459054 weve got a lot of relations with countries in our neighborhood
8459055 should the iranian regime do they have the sovereign right to have civilian nuclear power so like if i were you thats what id ask me and the answer is yes they do
8459056 i think it was in the rose garden where i issued this brilliant statement if i had a magic wand but the president doesnt have a magic wand
8459057 throughout our history the words of the declaration have inspired immigrants from around the world to set sail to our shores these immigrants have helped transform 13 small colonies into a great and growing nation of more than 300 people
8459058 theres no question about it wall street got drunk thats one of the reasons i asked you to turn off the tv cameras it got drunk and now its got a hangover the question is how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
8459059 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
8459060 i hear theres rumors on the internets that were going to have a draft
8459061 i know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully
8459062 you work three jobs uniquely american isnt it i mean that is fantastic that youre doing that
8459063 to affirm that there is an absolute constitutional protection of life in gestation would lead to the violation of the
8459064 despite all of the obstacles and the conscientious objections the service is working
8459065 doctors nurses and social workers have lived up to the commitment with a lot of generosity
8459066 we have the right to choose about our body but we dont have the right to end the life of a human being
8459067 they are not thinking about the psychological damage that the girls who have abortions go through
8459068 of course were going to discuss it that doesnt mean were going to force people to recognise
8459069 our goal is to eventually reach 80 percent of the native mips performance
8459070 right now we are at 40 percent so we have a long way to go
8459071 why would they set a target they dont think they can achieve that would only embarrass them
8459072 down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub
8459073 the agencys decline started when ronald reagan was president fda food inspections plummeted from 29 355 in 1980 to 7 668 in 1989
8459074 testing labs have not been modernized since 1975 and the 2008 budget request removed the reduction of childhood drowning deaths as a strategic goal because of resource limitations
8459075 the agencys entire toy testing department last year consisted of one man who dropped toys on his office floor to see if they broke
8459076 they cut me and my family some slack because im a baal teshuvah someone who comes back to very religious practice
8459077 our men treat our women like queens a woman should be taken care of in a car she might be seen by a man
8459078 the pilot relayed to the airport head that the hijackers do not want any negotiations and they have only one demand that the plane be refueled to go to paris
8459079 the hijackers also rejected the airport request that passengers who had fainted because of inadequate air conditioning in the plane be given medical treatment
8459080 they said they belong to slms abdel wahed nur who lives in paris they had coordinated with him to meet them in the french capital
8459081 we took no part in this hijacking at all it is completely against our aims values and objectives we condemn this hijacking with a strong voice
8459082 the pilot also informed the airport director that the hijackers numbered 10 before he came back to say their number could be more than that
8459083 we had three senior members on the plane and some other people they got on and someone hijacked it
8459084 about half an hour after takeoff a hijacker demanded to go to cairo as a destination
8459085 i have a pet tarantula at home that is the size of my hand i smile broader no i am not scared
8459086 ok kate i am going to get my picture with him did you want to come with

8459091 girls cant change tires fix a roof use a miter saw hell some cant even cook so much for that female independence crap you all preach about girls cant do shit
8459092 yea but i dont act like a cock gagging twat that needs to get drop kicked

8459097 i am going to class therefore i need to pretend im going to a formal and get dolled up for my 80 minute class because im a stupid whore
8459098 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8459099 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8459100 isnt face painting for a witch for halloween wonderful how
8459101 ive noticed this impatient attitude toward their father catching his hands clenched face painting for a witch for halloween seems to have some show of decision and this time face painting for a witch for halloween wrote i find myself by midnight face painting for a witch for halloween became like a bit afraid
8459102 shane oneill lord of the coast and feasting his eyes wide his experiment was made to repeat the experiments
8459103 i will switch off the song from one of the world
8459104 all of em hurt in their due sequence that mention should be allowed by all the world and
8459105 our offense runs through him because he can do so many things
8459106 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
8459107 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
8459108 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8459109 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8459110 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8459111 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8459112 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8459113 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8459114 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8459115 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8459116 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8459117 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8459118 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8459119 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8459120 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8459121 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8459122 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8459123 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8459124 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8459125 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8459126 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8459127 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8459128 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8459129 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8459130 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8459131 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8459132 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8459133 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8459134 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8459135 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8459136 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
8459137 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
8459138 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
8459139 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
8459140 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
8459141 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8459142 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8459143 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8459144 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8459145 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8459146 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8459147 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8459148 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8459149 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
8459150 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8459151 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8459152 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8459153 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8459154 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8459155 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8459156 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8459157 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8459158 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8459159 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8459160 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8459161 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8459162 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8459163 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8459164 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8459165 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8459166 tomorrow first thing in the morning contact all the legal counsels of the people involved maybe we can negotiate something
8459167 do you want us to ask atty murata of matsuura for help on this
8459168 no dont do that i have bothered them enough just ask for the necessary documents i dont want to involve them further im pretty sure you can handle this without their help
8459169 you know well have to work even outside the courtroom on this one
8459170 they are but i can have her come back there if you need her
8459171 yoshizawa san she has her work this is mine i can handle this
8459172 i dont know how you can bear to be away from her like this and its been how long a month since she flew here
8459173 dont you get even a bit jealous that shes spending so much time with the other one
8459174 tomorrow first thing in the morning contact all the legal counsels of the people involved maybe we can negotiate something
8459175 do you want us to ask atty murata of matsuura for help on this
8459176 no dont do that i have bothered them enough just ask for the necessary documents i dont want to involve them further im pretty sure you can handle this without their help
8459177 you know well have to work even outside the courtroom on this one
8459178 they are but i can have her come back there if you need her
8459179 yoshizawa san she has her work this is mine i can handle this
8459180 i dont know how you can bear to be away from her like this and its been how long a month since she flew here
8459181 dont you get even a bit jealous that shes spending so much time with the other one
8459182 maybe i should change your name and maybe i should get home now
8459183 come on rika tell me how you asked her to do it with you
8459184 if you dont im just going to imagine how you did it and you know youre not going to like the picture in my head because i can so totally imagine you seducing her
8459185 oh my god i cant believe im imagining my boss making out with someone and of all people with you so how is she
8459186 you have no idea how kawaii you look being all demure and modest like that
8459187 of course we do what else would we talk about anyway dont answer that how far did she go
8459188 maybe i should change your name and maybe i should get home now
8459189 its certainly the worst case of over crowding we came across
8459190 my x ray vision is picking up some weird plastics in your
8459191 ah go read a book on the evils of america society troupe

8459195 one of the advantages of our method is that it takes into account both people and places
8459196 for instance with unemployment we can say that people who are unemployed are width
8459197 from what ive seen so far my view is that if an area is more socially cohesive it increases your chances of having good quality of interpersonal relationships and a good social network
8459198 if you live in an area which is very unequal and polarised then you are less likely to have good social networks and friends
8459199 to what extent we can talk about happy people or happy places is it the place or the people my guess would be its a bit of both
8459200 the variance that is attributed to the place you live in is perhaps higher than our research suggests your immediate surroundings are very important in terms of happiness

8459207 the nsw decision opened up the potential for opportunistic litigation on either side and could have made it quite a bit more difficult for a franchisee to sell his or her business where there was a question of anything less than 100 compliance
8459208 the bottom line is that the nsw ketchell decision had deprived franchisees of a number of remedies and that problem has now been resolved
8459209 in my opinion a failure to provide a disclosure document or one that is misleading could well result in a court ordering cancellation of a franchise agreement or damages but a mere technical or inadvertent breach with no serious consequences wont have that result
8459210 despite the lies that youre making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses

8459217 pag yan ang process bibigyan ng kapahintulutan sila makahawak ng armas o mabigyan ng lisensya pero di sila maaring on their own sasabihin cvo at makatulong sa pagdepensa ng komunidad nila if it goes through the proper processes its members will be allowed to carry weapons but it cannot act on its own and claim it is a cvo that will defend its villages

8459454 this incident is yet another reminder of how dependent air travel in this country is on an antiquated air traffic control system airline passengers are sick and tired of delays and cancellations its time we overhauled the system as president i will work to deploy the next generation air traffic control system and order the faa to work in the interim to minimize disruptions like the one we experienced today
8459455 the news that the federal aviation administration has experienced a communications failure that has delayed flights across the eastern united states is yet another example of washington failing the american people it once again highlights the need to reform and repair a broken system while we still do not know the full extent of todays problems we do know that unless action is taken now the breakdowns of today will become all too common in the future
8459456 this is the second time in less than two years that we have seen a massive computer failure that has grounded thousands of flights across the country ensuring that passengers are kept flying safely and efficiently should be one of our nations top priorities how many times do we have to see these type of total system break downs before our government steps in to do something
8459457 congress has made great strides in coming up with an faa reauthorization bill that would upgrade this antiquated technology and ensure passengers basic rights but now we need to finish the job before financing expires on september 30 and we have to start all over from scratch we urge lawmakers to pass this important legislation and ensure that passengers everywhere have access to basic rights and recourses when traveling
8459458 this most recent failure of the faa computer system has effected every flight and every airport in the country today obviating the need for congress to stop kicking the can down the road and pass the faa modernization bill now before congress the faa reauthorization bill has already been delayed one year and now congress still has not finished the job through the senate will it take a catastrophic event before congress shores up our infrastructure in a meaningful way

8459501 am i really rested when im using sedatives instead of sleep
8459502 one of the advantages of our method is that it takes into account both people and places
8459503 for instance with unemployment we can say that people who are unemployed are on average happier in an area of high unemployment compared to being unemployed in an area where everyone else around you has a job
8459504 from what ive seen so far my view is that if an area is more socially cohesive it increases your chances of having good quality of interpersonal relationships and a good social network
8459505 if you live in an area which is very unequal and polarised then you are less likely to have good social networks and friends
8459506 to what extent we can talk about happy people or happy places is it the place or the people my guess would be its a bit of both
8459507 the variance that is attributed to the place you live in is perhaps higher than our research suggests your immediate surroundings are very important in terms of happiness

8459510 we have a solid development program for additional commercial spaces in taiyuan and we are optimistic that we will successfully acquire rights to a very valuable land bank these valuable development rights are unlikely to be duplicated in taiyuan as it is not possible to create more land
8459511 in addition management will continue our financially prudent practice of requiring prepaid rents from our commercial tenants for the entire term of the leases which is typically five to eight years this method allows for an expeditious return of capital to the company while greatly reducing debt service carried on the properties

8459515 if youre offering a financial incentive people may be tempted to post something which is perhaps not as truthful as it would be to get a reward
8459516 its harder to hide the truth in a video than it is in words
8459517 videos capture straight away the atmosphere of the hotel so it is difficult to make the experience more positive than it is
8459518 like with youtube visitors can comment on the videos reviewers can get negative comments on their posts
8459519 the most rated videos get more prominence on the site if a video gets a negative response the video will go downwards

8459521 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8459522 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8459523 terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president
8459524 iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world
8459525 that is not even close to obama saying iran is a

8459528 are you kidding me he could sell out any of the clubs in vegas
8459529 why on earth would anyone pay to see this fucking nerd when there are clubs full of tits and ass all down the vegas strip
8459530 no all people want to see that id pay to have a bunch of fake boobs in my face before paying to see this asshole any day of the fucking week and im a chick id bet that most of the vegas clientele is male so just imagine how they feel
8459531 why its a familiar smell but its been so long
8459532 ah its the smell of a silly and pointless story that i make up on the spot
8459533 youre an idiot for not wearing your feet what i wouldnt give to have mine back
8459534 having worked with actors for many years i find it hard to believe that anyone would have to be dragged kicking and screaming into show business but the next time that you see a chimpanzee in a movie on tv or in an ad chances are thats exactly what happened
8459535 its a sad story that starts when the animals are babies when they are torn away from their mothers and forced to depend upon human trainers great ape mothers are fiercely protective of their newborns which means that they must be tricked sedated or forcibly restrained when their infants are pulled from their arms this cruel practice leaves lifelong emotional scars on both the mothers who go into a deep depression and the babies
8459536 would heretics dare to come to the very seat of peter whence apostolic faith is derived and whither no errors can come
8459537 most people here have no idea what they are talking about you cant claim something is morally wrong because of some obscure passage in the new orange catechism the catechism is not infallible by any means as it is not dogma it is an authentic teaching of the pope but hardly qualifies as an infallible teaching of the ordinary magisterium you really need to use common sense on this one use your head cmon
8459538 there have only been two statements in the history of the church one in 1854 and one in 1950 that were infallible statements of a pope by the way where does the church teach infallibly that girls cannot be altar servers and that priests can never be women it doesnt teach that anywhere i know of if i am wrong please provide proof from the solemn definition of an ecumenical council
8459539 i put a lot of weight on my wife was eating fast food she was eating hamburgers and pizza and tacos and misery loves company

8459546 whether youre famous or not what it just means is that the rest of us will hear about it it doesnt mean that theyre the only people who will experience it theyre all equally tragic
8459547 but it can be harder for famous people to seek help because of their high profiles
8459548 my thoughts and prays are with marks family and friends he will be sorely missed my many

8459550 as a student nurse his character has been part of my inspiration how i want to be as a nurse
8459551 when we think of serious illness that affects the parents we sometimes forget about the children
8459552 if we dont deal with depression now children can grow up to be angry adults
8459553 they need a place where they can unwind and eventually talk about it with other kids that have been through the same thing

8459556 people in city got very excited about how we could do better environmentally than discharging to the missouri river and so they embraced and endorsed the idea
8459557 now during this time i went on tv and cautioned against the location of the wetlands near the well fields feeling the potential to compromise the water supply and to consume the land in which the well fields would be expanded as the city looks for more water i wasnt opposed to wetlands treatment i just didnt want it to be near the water supply
8459558 theres even a song about me and the pipeline to the river it wasnt at all pleasant
8459559 like a groundhog we always wanted a second way out
8459560 so we built in a way to bypass the conservation area and thats still an option
8459561 weve altered the historic flow of the bottoms weve changed the mechanics
8459562 on the other hand if all the wells test the same then that rules out the wetlands involvement in the problem
8459563 my heart goes out to families coming face to face with this difficult issue
8459564 i feel that no physical barrier can prevent suicide on or off the bridge from happening
8459565 the 50 million would be better spent to educate teens and adults about stress depression how to recognize it in themselves as well as for suicide prevention
8459566 we also got many written responses and those will be looked at along with responses we got from agencies

8459586 i practically lived in pennsylvania and ohio and places like that
8459587 when i see joe i think im going to give him my old itinerary and tell him dont make a new one
8459588 once youre no longer the candidate youre a delegate and thats fine by me they dont owe me anything
8459589 i think joe gets that point the most important question is can he be president i think most people believe he passes that test
8459590 joes got to be obamas point man but not his hit man that shouldnt be his role
8459591 one of the things i like about joe is hes a scrapper
8459592 ive met someone this man means a lot to me
8459593 income poverty and health insurance coverage in the united states 2007
8459594 as a result the share of the population with private health insurance fell dramatically from 75 6 percent in 1987 to 67 5 percent in 2007
8459595 without the rapid rise in medicaid enrollments during these years the number of uninsured americans would have skyrocketed even faster than it did
8459596 did not remotely keep pace with u s population growth
8459597 the new figure 45 7 million uninsured is still unacceptably high
8459598 its the second highest figure since the 1960s when medicare and medicaid were enacted
8459599 it is likely that the census bureau figures represent a misleading picture of the current situation
8459600 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd nyse amd
8459601 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8459602 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8459603 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8459604 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8459605 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8459606 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8459607 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
8459608 i see this as a public health study not only for us but for the whole world it gives everyone the license to use both drugs interchangeably
8459609 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
8459610 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept
8459611 we believe the american court will make a just verdict on the case according to law and the facts
8459612 a tenta o f ustica e as franjas da alma humana
8459613 we want to assure russia that china will firmly support it to host the winter olympic games in sochi
8459614 we know the complicated history and reality of the south ossetia and abkhazia issues
8459615 in accordance with chinas consistent and principled stance on such issues we hope the relevant parties would resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation
8459616 unless the state of texas violates their own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot
8459617 we are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation when we miss deadlines we get no second chances this is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy
8459618 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable
8459619 therefore republicans and democrats should be held to the same standards
8459620 my father was in world war i for five years in the british army one day my mother took me to a seaport in southern england where his ship was coming from france
8459621 she took me down to the beach and while i was playing in the sand she noticed airplanes flying around and heard this noise tat tat tat tat tat when we went back home and the landlady said my god we were frightened we didnt know where you were and the germans were strafing the docks luckily they missed my fathers boat

8459627 on our last mission the germans got us with an 88 millimeter flack cannon and they blew a hole between the number one and number two engines
8459628 we spent 13 and a half months in stalag luft iii the camp where they had the big escape we got out when patton started to close in on the camp all prisoners of war got a 60 day leave of absence at home in the meantime i got married to jeannette torr
8459629 areas over there are very swampy wed dig a trench all around where we wanted the runway to be and install pipes with holes in them all through that trenching and then wed put pumps on either end another chore we had to do was keep these portable generators for installations navigation equipment on and fan belts were premium over there they would wear out because of the heat and the moisture one time a three star general came in from wright patterson air force base i said general ive got the junk of the air force theyve sent me every different kind of generator two days later theres a great big transport airplane full of fan belts he sent every different kind he could get his hands on
8459630 i was the engineer at hamilton and in 1964 the commanding general of the air force at the pentagon came to visit hamilton and wanted to know if id take a crew back to vietnam
8459631 our job was to build a bunch of angled steel walls on the airfield ramp so we could tuck the airplanes in them to protect them from enemy mortars what had happened while i was at hamilton they had all their fighter bombers lined up and loaded and the vietcong came in there with mortars and hit one or two of them and the sympathetic vibrations blew everything up those shields were so important at the time at that period of warfare that i briefed the air staff at the pentagon about the project
8459632 i retired in 1967 we didnt want to leave novato so we looked and looked and it took nine years to find our current home weve been 30 years in this home
8459633 when i retired from the air force they were just getting ready to build gnoss field and i applied for the job i got a lot of programs through the federal government we extended the runway put lights in and did a lot of stuff to improve the place
8459634 ya estamos hartos de tanta violencia tanta impunidad tanta irresponsabilidad

8459636 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories
8459637 of the 2 519 batsmen who have taken the crease in 131 years of test cricket bradman stands alone and untouched
8459638 i am no aware of any other sport which has one competitor so far above any other performer
8459639 no one has even come close to this i suspect no one else ever will

8459651 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8459652 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states

8459670 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8459671 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8459672 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8459673 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8459674 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8459675 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
8459676 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo
8459677 cesen los allanamientos y la militarizaci n de las comunidades mapuche
8459678 los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche
8459679 el ministerio del interior presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal

8459682 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8459683 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8459684 that is not the same thing as having health insurance
8459685 so instead of producing worthless statistics that people fling around in vacuous editorials and pointless debates the census bureau should produce meaningful numbers identifying all of the sources of funds people will draw on if they need medical care
8459686 people are working harder than ever but the jobs they have dont provide health insurance
8459687 ironically this all happened while the president was trying to cut back on medicaid
8459688 thats shocking a fat guy with a huge tub of popcorn go figure
8459689 did you hear that woman behind us she talked through the entire movie doesnt anyone know how to whisper
8459690 awesome little remote worked out of box with my d50 perfectly fast shipping
8459691 great remote works better than the nikon original at a fraction of the cost
8459692 prompt delivery of a neat remote that works great with my nikon d40x
8459693 handy remote control for the d70 thanks for the speedy shipping
8459694 i just wish they could do it civilly so we dont have to babysit
8459695 i used to sit at home with my friends in high school and watch kentucky fried movie and airplane and vomit from laughing
8459696 then 9 11 happened and i couldnt take it anymore
8459697 the response to 9 11 the right was saying this is pure evil were facing and the left was saying how are we at fault for this
8459698 if he had been a republican president we would have demanded his resignation and marched on the white house
8459699 when 9 11 happened i knew democrats wouldnt be strong enough to fight this war
8459700 this morning i had another talk with the german chancellor herr hitler here is the paper which bears his name upon it as well as mine
8459701 that negotiation went well fifty million dead worldwide nicely done mr chamberlain
8459702 next item you must agree to stop supplying the explosive devices that are killing our american soldiers in iraq
8459703 i figured he was like everyone else in hollywood a democrat
8459704 and we knew that this was not a democrat movie
8459705 we were afraid that he would not want to be involved in something that was so directly taking on the left and that he would not want to play the michael moore character
8459706 i thought that the minute we started talking about politics that would be the end
8459707 there was this dance that we did a dance familiar to conservative actors in hollywood lots of actors have done it
8459708 i usually just bite my tongue unless it gets too ridiculous
8459709 the only thing that really bothers me is when they go off about the president it just gets annoying
8459710 if its the last movie i do ill go work for steves company
8459711 im glad some of the bigger guys jumped in dennis hopper jon voight james woods
8459712 the accepted way to speak about america is in the voice that disrespects it and the voice thats unacceptable is the one that loves america
8459713 petraeus has to couch every bit of optimism in some convoluted formulation to avoid the promised rush of disrespect
8459714 no one on the left wants to admit that radical islamists want to kill americans the jews everyone in the west
8459715 i try to talk to my friends on the left and they just dont get it most of them have never even heard of sayyid qutb how can you have an intellectual discussion about the war were in without knowing who sayyid qutb is
8459716 once they found out i was a republican unfortunately for some people it was a problem
8459717 its almost like people who are gay show up at the baths and say oh i didnt know you were gay
8459718 its too dark outside the sun is not the answer
8459719 we really didnt have to do a lot of stretching
8459720 radical christianity is just as threatening as radical islam in a country like america where we have a separation of church and state
8459721 obama is not qualified to be president and itll be a disaster
8459722 i dont think that obama is an evil guy i just think hes wrong but i do think we face real evil in ahmadinejad and the mullahs and all these crazy guys
8459723 john kerry was and obama is fortunately kerry was a stiff but obama isnt a stiff and hes really adaptable hes like a really clever virus who adapts obamas the farthest left of all of these guys and thats why he associated with all of those crazies terrorists preachers of hate
8459724 when i look at the other side when i look at barack obama i see expediency
8459725 hes like family i could never disown him i didnt know him i didnt hear those words in that church
8459726 its a movie its a satire and its a funny satire i dont want to point to this thing just because there are so few films from conservative sources and make it a target its a movie lets not burden this little horse with additional weights
8459727 the clock is running make the most of today time waits for no man yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery today is a gift thats why it is called the present
8459728 en el d a de hoy comenc el tr mite ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos con el fin de solicitar una medida cautelar de protecci n frente a las agresiones personales y obsesivas en mi contra que me colocan en serio riesgo
8459729 la comisi n de acusaciones de la c mara de representantes iniciar una indagaci n preliminar contra el presidente ernesto samper para que se establezca si recibi con destino a terceros dineros de la mafia cuando se desempe aba como ministro de desarrollo el origen de la nueva investigaci n es el expediente que adelanta la fiscal a general de la naci n contra c sar villegas arciniegas por el delito de enriquecimiento il cito de ese mismo proceso se deriv la indagatoria contra el actual embajador de colombia en grecia juan fernando cristo
8459730 bajo la gravedad del juramento el ex directivo del f tbol c sar hernando villegas se ratific ayer en sus acusaciones contra el ex consejero para las comunicaciones y actual viceministro de relaciones exteriores para europa asia africa y ocean a juan fernando cristo
8459731 quiero invitar al se or presidente a que saquemos esa bandera blanca
8459732 as much as consumers seem to be slowing down at the moment i think theres still lot of investment in capacity
8459733 the rba has seen a consumer demand slowdown and relied on business investment holding up
8459734 but anything beyond that depends on data to come after christmas
8459735 re how horrible have the last 8 yrs been for you well my life is similar slightly better because ive learned to make better
8459736 re re how horrible have the last 8 yrs been for you see i was asking about you not people out there but since you brought up katrina

8459740 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8459741 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8459742 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8459743 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8459744 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
8459745 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8459746 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8459747 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8459748 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8459749 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8459750 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8459751 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando

8459755 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
8459756 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
8459757 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

8459766 six meat buffet the blog of choice for those of us on the atkins diet
8459767 six meat buffet is becoming a regular boner town usa god bless us everyone jihad jimmy minister of war crimes and chief defender of the faith
8459768 six meat sometimes with extra cheese and spicy peppers got brew
8459769 preston the head chef at six meat buffet wants to put his meat in your mouth
8459770 right minded thinking basted in the tasty sauce of truth
8459771 im not sure if preston is trying to put out a humorous blog or not but his writings keep me laughing
8459772 tenderized boned and free from nasty by products i love six meat buffet
8459773 one day i was looking for food on the web and i found this craphole called six meat buffet
8459774 a man and his cleaver whacking away at lipoidal thinking everywhere
8459775 smb is like pork sausage bad for you ugly to watch being made but too damned tasty to resist
8459776 what i have learned from this site is that i now know where mouth breathers and knuckle draggers come to get their rocks off
8459777 les agradecemos a los t os de mc anime por todo
8459778 you know shes got that whole woodstock thing going on
8459779 i will not go into it as it usually means that i am going to be fired soon and i dont want to think about that right now other than to say that profits that suffer is ugly in the best of times and it will be much much uglier mmu this time
8459780 the alarming part of this report is the acceleration of inflation in the past 3 months while the unadjusted rate for the past 12 months was 6 2 the 3 month annualized rate of increase was 11 9
8459781 on a seasonally adjusted basis the cpi u advanced 0 8 percent in july following a 1 1 percent increase in june
8459782 about half of the overall increase in the all items index
8459783 the food index rose 0 9 percent in july after rising 0 8 percent in june indexes for five of the six major grocery store food groups rose at least 1 0 percent
8459784 were seeing more and more people visiting food banks for the first time because theyve lost their jobs or theyre not getting raises
8459785 the cpi w is used for making the annual cost of living adjustments to social security payments
8459786 while consumers suffer inflation a the bottom of the pricing pipeline producers feel it at the top
8459787 to the extent inflation gets stuck with them their profits suffer
8459788 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked to atlanta gave me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8459789 this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8459790 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes like everybodys all time favorite i know hes real professional
8459791 i mean the respect of your peers is ultimately what you play the game for and really nothing else
8459792 theres no accolades that im chasing at this point other than to be on a winning club and to play in a world series
8459793 i got to see up close what kind of professional he is how he prepares for games what he adds to the clubhouse
8459794 hes as good as it gets along those lines hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse as well
8459795 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes like everybodys all time favorite i know hes real professional
8459796 j d s injury necessitated this trade but that said were really happy to have mark as a red sox
8459797 i think he adds a lot to our club hes still a plus defender we feel in center and in right hes played some first base in his past as well which might come in handy here with sean casey a little beat up as well marks got great instincts in the field still got a strong throwing arm and a great head for the game offensively he grinds his at bats the way we like
8459798 he knows the game well he knows his strengths i thought he was the best right fielder i ever saw cut a ball off and as accurate an arm as possible people would say that theyd try to test vladdie guerrero when he was in montreal but no one wanted to test kotsay he brings more to the table than just swinging a pretty good bat i think he knows the game real well
8459799 we hope j d s not out too long but if he is it will be nice to have mark on the roster and help fill that void
