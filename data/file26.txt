260000 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
260001 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
260002 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
260003 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
260004 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
260005 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
260006 were arguing over a gimmick that would save you half a tank of gas over the course of the entire summer so that everyone in washington can pat themselves on the back and say they did something
260007 would save you half a tank of gas over the course of the entire summer

260015 ive been coming here for three years and ive never seen it like this
260016 the layoffs are unfortunate everyone has to work its like a domino effect
260017 people need money so they come to us but they dont have the money to pay back
260018 what is unusual is all of a sudden they closed early
260019 for me its a headache because i have to come every month
260020 the tail of the line is usually inside not way out here
260021 its starting to look that way but we dont know for sure

260026 mixed emotions i wouldnt say that its not a surprise its hard to be all hurt and broken up i guess it would be different if it comes to the end of the year and i have to go somewhere else
260027 i would miss the city i feel like ive become a part of this whole state it would be heartbreaking but whether i stay here or not isnt up to me just like when i came here it wasnt up to me
260028 champ is the best the game has ever seen so its pretty plain and simple self explanatory

260030 before new hampshire i had helped out in local campaigns but this was my first experience with national politics
260031 it was exciting to see first hand how the process operates
260032 it was amazing how many people really wanted to listen to what i had to say some would invite me into their homes to talk to them
260033 the campaign has become a movement of young people people who have in the past felt betrayed by the political process it is also a grassroots campaign which makes us feel like we are making a real difference obama has given young people the opportunity to seize the political process and run with it that will make a big difference going forward
260034 there were high school students with signs made by their parents
260035 they had decided to give up two hours of sleep before their classes to volunteer

260038 he is personable and charming remembers peoples names and looks like he is listening intently
260039 one key problem he has is that people dont know enough about him the indian community should see that because of his experiences he has a global perspective between now and november he will reach out to the minority groups so they can learn more
260040 the primaries have shown that record turnouts are possible many of my friends are in traditionally red states working to turn them blue we are doing so much better that democratic nominees usually do in these republican states

260048 shrider grabbed troyer very forcefully by the arm held him against his will and did not let him get away from her
260049 he thinks to himself would i bleed for the cause im a global warming heat soaring street exploring rebel saw the face of the devil it glowed like my blunt tip snake tongue voodoo analog earprint grand nationalist spin a web so thick you cant escape read the prose pros see through the gate

260052 do you think any of them beat their wives chances are they do the most devout christians beat their wives culturally many of our bishops come from places where it is culturally accepted to beat your wife in that regard it makes the conversation quite difficult
260053 we all left the plane and found televisions in the airport where we crowded around to see the broadcast of what had happened people were lined up to call loved ones to assure them we were safely on the ground i shall always remember the 12 or so missionaries who were on their way to the mission field on our flight they made phone calls and then we saw them huddled in a circle in a corner of the airport kneeling in prayer together how i wish i could have captured that moment to share with the mothers and fathers of those sweet young men as they saw the need for prayer right away
260054 he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live
260055 and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die
260056 peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid
260057 better than a light and safer than a known way
260058 he was buried and he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
260059 after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once
260060 after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles
260061 and now after the many testimonies which have been given of him this is the testimony last of all which we give of him that he lives
260062 for we saw him even on the right hand of god and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the only begotten of the father
260063 that by him and through him and of him the worlds are and were created and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto god
260064 ive been thinking about making some course corrections in my life i plan to take the first step tomorrow
260065 have i done any good in the world today have i helped anyone in need
260066 when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your god
260067 not to know that any christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere whatever it may be will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one lifes opportunity misused yet such was i oh such was i
260068 why did i walk through crowds of fellow beings with my eyes turned down and never raise them to that blessed star which led the wise men to a poor abode were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted
260069 when as children we visited my grandmother part of the fun was making faces at mrs wilcoxs grandchildren one banner day we put a snake into the wilcox rain barrel my grandmother made token protests but we sensed tacit sympathy
260070 dont think for a minute that this was a one sided campaign mrs wilcox had grandchildren too grandma didnt get off scot free never a windy washday went by that the clothesline didnt mysteriously break with the clothes falling in the dirt
260071 i dont know how grandma could have borne her troubles so long if it hadnt been for the household page of her daily boston newspaper
260072 when i was about sixteen mrs wilcox died in a small town no matter how much you have hated your next door neighbor it is only common decency to run over and see what practical service you can do the bereaved grandma neat in a percale apron to show that she meant what she said about being put to work crossed the lawn to the wilcox house where the wilcox daughters set her to cleaning the already immaculate front parlor for the funeral and there on the parlor table in the place of honor was a huge scrapbook and in the scrapbook pasted neatly in parallel columns were grandmas letters to sea gull over the years and sea gulls letters to her though neither woman had known it grandmas worst enemy had been her best friend that was the only time i remember seeing my grandmother cry i didnt know then exactly what she was crying about but i do now she was crying for all the wasted years which could never be salvaged
260073 i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith

260101 de tijd dat elke officier van justitie kon doen wat hij uitdacht is voorbij
260102 burgers een nieuwe identiteit bezorgen is een nogal moeizaam proces gebleken dat de nederlandse justitie zich met zeer veel moeite eigen heeft gemaakt van haagse kees moeten de autoriteiten voetstoots hebben aangenomen dat de man daadwerkelijk in levensgevaar verkeerde ik denk dat ze blind hebben getekend uit vrees in opspraak te raken voor het geval de man iets overkwam een officieel getuigenbeschermingsprogramma bestond toen nog niet van een professionele dreigingsanalyse was evenmin sprake die werkwijze wreekte zich pas toen het verhaal van haagse kees niet waar bleek te zijn
260103 die toezegging van justitie was zwaar in strijd met de wet
260104 just how large is the gold endowment of the beardmore geraldton gold camp
260105 kodiak continues to systematically explore its extensive landholdings within the beardmore geraldton gold camp based on continuing positive results the magnitude of th e exploration program has been expanded dramatically additional prospecting crews excavators and multiple drills are currently testing over 30 kilometres of indicated structures on the elmhurst lake intrusion beyond the current extent of the hercules project exploration to date has significantly expanded the resource potential and our knowledge of this entire area the process remains ongoing and our exploration plan has proven to be extremely effective in unlocking the resource potential of the entire 30 square km hercules project area in addition the broad scope of our regional exploration program in targeted areas of the 1 400 square kilometres controlled by kodiak outside the elmhirst lake intrusion is designed to ultimately reveal the resource potential of our entire landholdings our objective remains to ensure that our shareholders participate in the realization by kodiak of the full value of its assets we look forward to reporting ongoing results with much anticipation
260106 cest bizarre quand tu vois quun champion du monde jacques villeneuve a de la difficult aussi cest comme a maintenant cest tr s difficile et il faut travailler fort
260107 ll faut faire son chemin cest ce quil faut faire pour entrer une fois que tu es dedans a va je ne pense pas que les kyle busch jeff gordon et jimmie johnson doivent trouver des commanditaires a soulign villeneuve lors dun point de presse vendredi mais cest comme a il y a beaucoup de pilotes qui sont habiles qui veulent courir qui sont issus de courses am ricaines
260108 les jeunes am ricains se retrouvent sur terre battue l ge de six ans puis ils gravissent les chelons et se retrouvent vite l chelle nationale ce qui fait que rendu 17 ans ils sont de vraies fus es cest donc tr s comp titif et cest ce qui explique quil y ait moins de places pour les canadiens en nascar a expliqu carpentier vendredi au canada on conduit des moto neiges en hiver
260109 cest plus une question de montrer quel point jai envie de faire ce m tier l les quipes de nascar ne veulent pas dun pique assiette
260110 un bon r sultat aiderait du c t des commanditaires mais a naurait aucun effet sur les quipes parce que la course de samedi sera disput e sur circuit routier a d clar villeneuve ce qui importe aux quipes cest ce quon peut faire sur les ovales
260111 ca peut toujours aider si tu domines tout le week end a dit carpentier qui avait justement fait cela lann e pass e en obtenant des bons r sultats aux essais en d crochant la position de t te en qualifications puis en terminant deuxi me dans la course
260112 mais en m me temps cest plus dificile maintenant que a l tait je ne pense pas quon va voir autant de pilotes issus des circuits de monoplaces samener en nascar chaque ann e comme a t le cas cette ann e
260113 ils ont tent lexp rience avec plusieurs pilotes cette ann e mais la moiti dentre eux ne sont d j plus l
260114 ca allait tre la premi re ann e de la voiture de demain cette ann e aucun pilote navait de lexp rience avec elle alors les quipes se disaient quelles navaient rien perdre prenant une chance avec des pilotes comme moi mais l tout le monde est en train demmagasiner de lexp rience alors a va devenir de plus en plus difficile pour ceux qui nen ont pas

260119 the article mentions that her perception of having a concrete body literally disintegrated before her eyes as a clot shut of the functioning of a specific area of the brain
260120 her perceptions changed too she could see that the atoms and molecules making up her body blended with the space around her the whole world and the creatures in it were all part of the same magnificent field of shimmering energy
260121 the energy of my spirit seemed to flow like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria
260122 a stronger inspector general and a website for cpsc employees to anonymously report their concerns along with whistleblower protections for those who report about unsafe products will contribute to more transparency and accountability at this agency
260123 this bill introduces critical reforms like ensuring that toys are tested for safety before they go on the market banning certain hazardous substances and creating an online database for consumers to share information about dangerous products with each other consumers dont always come out on top in congress especially when big business fights hard but this time consumers won big congress deserves applause
260124 most of the players in the league use marijuana and i have and do partake in smoking weed in the off season sometimes

260126 if melinda had any information nancy grace stopped the investigation in its track
260127 with american families and small businesses facing record high gasoline prices congress has adjourned to leave washington for a five week break
260128 congress should not take the next five weeks off while the american people suffer at the pump we respectfully request that you schedule a vote on the comprehensive american energy act during an emergency legislative session this month
260129 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products

260138 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
260139 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
260140 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
260141 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
260142 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
260143 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
260144 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
260145 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
260146 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
260147 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
260148 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

260151 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age i still want my grandmother to keep getting the flu vaccine
260152 it is safe so it is worth getting even if it might lower the risk of pneumonia and death only slightly
260153 this paper does not negate the need for influenza vaccine
260154 other studies that were specifically designed to address this question have shown benefits from vaccination in reducing both infection and subsequent morbidity and mortality in the elderly
260155 anyone over the age of 65 or who falls into an at risk group including those with heart problems diabetes or asthma should always make sure they are vaccinated every year
260156 it should not deter people from getting the flu vaccine because influenza is an unpleasant illness in itself and the vaccine is particularly important for elderly people with chronic diseases who have a weakened immune system and are susceptible to developing pneumonia

260160 particularly egregious was the manner in which merrill lynch co opted its supposedly independent research department to assist in sales efforts geared towards reducing its inventory of ars
260161 when sales and trading including auction desk personnel did not agree with the tone or context of a published research piece merrill lynch managers permitted sales and trading to insist the published report to be retracted and replaced with a more sales friendly piece

260177 new york cannot wait any longer for the administration to take action on the dangerous tce contamination across our state a growing number of communities are facing the serious health risks caused by exposure to tce including cancer damage to the nervous and immune systems and developmental problems in children and yet despite these dangers the bush epa delays and delays my legislation will force the administration to finally take steps to address this pressing issue i welcome the committees bi partisan approval of this important measure and urge the senate to pass it promptly
260178 the evidence on carcinogenic risk and other health hazards from exposure to trichloroethylene has strengthened since 2001

260208 this is another example of states being two steps ahead of the federal government with the white house and gop leadership continuing to block environmental bills states are being forced to come up with their own plans
260209 instead of wasting time debating offshore drilling plans that are opposed by the public and which will do nothing to solve our energy problems the ocean action plan wisely promotes renewable offshore energy and ecosystem based management to ensure our ocean are being administered responsibly and protected for future generations
260210 the plan echoes calls for a commitment to our oceans through an ocean trust fund and regional ocean management federal legislation i introduced last year would create a trust fund to provide support for regional plans exactly like the one introduced on tuesday
260211 im proud to represent the peaceful values of the central coast were lucky enough to live in communities that are aware of whats going on overseas and care about the fate of others
260212 groups like peace action do a great job bringing a message of peace to congress and its a message many of my colleagues need to hear
260213 five years after the beginning of the iraq war the united states desperately needs to make a fundamental change of course in foreign policy
260214 ultimately its an active and vocal public that will determine if the country makes the profound changes in u s foreign policy we need
260215 our military has unfortunately been forced to take on many roles it is not suited for from diplomat to nation building this civilian response corps will shift the burden of stabilization and reconstruction to civilian experts where it should have rested all along
260216 usaid and the state department dont have the resources they need and this response corps will go a long way toward restoring their capabilities
260217 stabilization and reconstruction is a mission that civilians must lead
260218 but for too long our civilians have not had the capacity to lead and investments were not made to prepare them to lead
260219 thanks a lot asta for trying to kill father nightroad you stupid ass

260231 all i can remember is good times with tim i will miss that but hes in all our hearts another said rip buddy only the good die young
260232 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up
260233 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
260234 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
260235 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
260236 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
260237 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
260238 we want to make sure that the process is followed as aggressively as possible a full legal process and the perpetrator is definitely dealt with the full force of the law
260239 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history

260249 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
260250 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
260251 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
260252 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
260253 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
260254 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
260255 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
260256 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
260257 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
260258 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
260259 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same

260267 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
260268 he was not with the ideology of osama bin laden and people like him he was only searching for pleasure and money in this life
260269 he is intending to invoke self incrimination rights and not appear
260270 it is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me
260271 i believe that this fact seriously jeopardizes the trial itself
260272 i do not know how long the arm of mr holbrooke is or whether that arm can reach me here
260273 hes one of the greatest mass murderers of the world and hes putting this out in order to defend himself its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
260274 what i said was if anyone deserves the death penalty its karadzic and mladic
260275 that was my specific reference and if karadzic is in the hague and is still scared that i have an arm that long i guess i should treat it in a backhanded way as a compliment

260308 i thought how are they moving the stage because this is part of the building
260309 then i thought no thats not right and i thought maybe were on some kind of rug and theyre pulling it out from underneath us then i thought that it could be an earthquake or third day could be rocking california so hard that it makes the ground shake
260310 any kind of tv or video thing always makes me nervous
260311 people ask all the time if i get nervous before going on stage and i dont before a normal concert or show its always when youre doing something outside of the norm theres going to be a few million people watching tonight and it makes me a little nervous but even more excited than nervous
260312 but i just feel like this is really a big deal im really trying to soak this in and doing that is making me appreciate this as a big opportunity i feel like its bigger than just us i feel like were representing all of christian music were really proud to be a part of that its a great place to be and this is the kind of opportunity that shows christian music is not just a subgenre defined by its lyrical content or where people spend their sunday mornings christian music can really stand on its own
260313 we were so excited about the opportunity and now were glad its over
260314 it took all that work and we traveled across the country for three minutes and 30 seconds

260360 there is no greater spokesman for human rights in the world than our president
260361 the sudanese governments recent attacks take us back to the very darkest days of the conflict
260362 the security council shouldnt stand by as though this is
260363 the councils inaction has given sudan a green light to continue attacking civilian targets flouting international law and security council resolutions
260364 these horrific attacks on civilians show khartoums confidence that there will be no real consequences for its actions its time for the security council to prove them wrong
260365 darfur is the focus of international attention and many western nations want china to play a bigger role
260366 this is why i have been appointed as the special envoy of the chinese government on the darfur issue
260367 since last may i have visited sudan four times in the future if it is necessary i will pay more visits
260368 we have a good relationship with sudan we have some advantages in talking to sudan so we should use this as leverage we will persuade them in a direct way to work with the international community and be more cooperative
260369 as for the olympic games any advice or comments even if it contains misunderstandings or criticism we are open to and welcome this advice
260370 we are willing to listen to any comments that contain reasonable elements but for those few who attempt to tarnish the olympic games on the pretext of issues totally unrelated to the olympics like the darfur issue we are firmly opposed to such attempts
260371 since my birth ive never seen planes bombing like this there were no warning signs the attack would come
260372 we were able to bring nothing with us some people were lucky and had time to gather food but i brought nothing out apart from my children
260373 most refugees are in a state of shock especially those still unable to trace family members from darfur
260374 let us shout out in one voice stop the killing
260375 wei jingsheng is the best known chinese human rights and democracy fighter and is the leader for the opposition against the chinese communist dictatorship
260376 courage to stand alone letters from prison and other writings
260377 in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends
260378 we are ready to work with the u k and the rest of the international community and contribute to the resolution of the darfur issue
260379 were going to urge the government of sudan to show more flexibility and to be more cooperative
260380 rolling out the hybrid peacekeeping operation and resolving the darfur issue require the joint efforts of all sides
260381 first the sudan government should cooperate better with the international community and demonstrate greater flexibility on some technical issues next anti government organisations in the darfur region should return to the negotiating table
260382 in the political process several months have passed without substantive progress
260383 should use their own influence to work on all the sides
260384 we are ready to work with the u k and the rest of the international community and contribute to the resolution of the darfur issue
260385 were going to urge the government of sudan to show more flexibility and to be more cooperative
260386 this is deeply concerning and we are making every effort with the chadian authorities to get these refugees moved quickly
260387 women report being raped children have been separated from their families
260388 it is because of them that we have the problems we have today
260389 they gave no reason for their actions but it was clear the relocation would not take place
260390 trying to find a solution to this problem which is leaving the refugees extremely exposed and vulnerable
260391 the area is highly insecure with roaming armed groups posing a real threat to the refugees and aid workers
260392 its up to him i am going to the olympics i view the olympics as a sporting event
260393 i do remind him that he can do more to relieve the suffering in darfur
260394 there are a lot of issues that i suspect people are going to opine about during the olympics the dalai lama crowd youve got the global warming folks you got darfur
260395 i am not going to go and use the olympics as an opportunity to express my opinions to the chinese people in a public way because i do it all the time with the president
260396 i was pretty well backed off of it by a lot of folks here in america who care deeply about the issue once you make that decision you have to rely upon an international organisation like the united nations to provide the oomph
260397 it is a decision i am now living with and it is a decision that requires us to continue to rally the conscience of the world
260398 it is only in the united states that a penniless survivor of the holocaust and a fighter in the anti nazi underground could have received an education raised a family and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a member of congress i will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country
260399 defined by courage optimism and unwavering dedication to his principles and to his family
260400 the world is running out of patience over whats going in darfur
260401 not to do things that will cause the international community to impose sanctions on them
260402 to link the darfur issue to the olympics is a move to politicize the olympics and this is inconsistent with the olympics spirit and will bear no fruit
260403 all i can say is that they were school age
260404 people are fighting each other and trying to drive them out of the area we have to evacuate people
260405 the government is doing this to try to influence mediation efforts
260406 after stealing the elections from kenyans kibaki now wishes to deny them justice and peace
260407 what is really happening is a continuation of the ethnic cleansing that railas people are doing to kill the presidents people
260408 for the umpteenth time we again ask president kibaki and orange democratic movement leader mr raila odinga to work for peace truth and justice
260409 the necessary weapons and ammunition to exterminate the african tribes in darfur
260410 they shoved a guard and tried to force a gate and behaved in a very rude way
260411 my heart our hearts are breaking for what happened in cambodia today especially for the survivors of genocide
260412 our goal today was to deliver these flowers in deepest respect to honor those who have perished here in cambodia and in darfur and in all genocides everywhere
260413 why dont they just go to china to do that
260414 its pretty harsh to be against a ceremony that honors the victims of darfur and genocide survivors everywhere
260415 our resolve is still the same which is to go forward
260416 its really difficult how anyone can be against honoring survivors of genocide particularly as cambodians
260417 we do not want to see any trouble or confrontation with them said touch naroth the police chief for cambodias capital phnom penh but we simply cannot let this group breach the law either
260418 the olympic games are not a political issue therefore we wont allow any rally to light a torch
260419 we will not support the activity we will not allow them to politicise the olympic games
260420 the symbolic olympic torch relay is urging the chinese government as both olympic host and sudans strongest political and economic partner to use its special influence with the sudanese government
260421 forced millions from their homes and in particular claimed the lives of tens of thousands
260422 ronald reagan would have never gone to the olympics i guarantee you that never gone
260423 will go down in history as cooperating in the genocide olympics of 2008

260442 in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends
260443 we are ready to work with the u k and the rest of the international community and contribute to the resolution of the darfur issue
260444 were going to urge the government of sudan to show more flexibility and to be more cooperative
260445 rolling out the hybrid peacekeeping operation and resolving the darfur issue require the joint efforts of all sides
260446 first the sudan government should cooperate better with the international community and demonstrate greater flexibility on some technical issues next anti government organisations in the darfur region should return to the negotiating table
260447 in the political process several months have passed without substantive progress
260448 should use their own influence to work on all the sides
260449 we are ready to work with the u k and the rest of the international community and contribute to the resolution of the darfur issue
260450 were going to urge the government of sudan to show more flexibility and to be more cooperative
260451 this is deeply concerning and we are making every effort with the chadian authorities to get these refugees moved quickly
260452 women report being raped children have been separated from their families
260453 it is because of them that we have the problems we have today
260454 they gave no reason for their actions but it was clear the relocation would not take place
260455 trying to find a solution to this problem which is leaving the refugees extremely exposed and vulnerable
260456 the area is highly insecure with roaming armed groups posing a real threat to the refugees and aid workers
260457 its up to him i am going to the olympics i view the olympics as a sporting event
260458 i do remind him that he can do more to relieve the suffering in darfur
260459 there are a lot of issues that i suspect people are going to opine about during the olympics the dalai lama crowd youve got the global warming folks you got darfur
260460 i am not going to go and use the olympics as an opportunity to express my opinions to the chinese people in a public way because i do it all the time with the president
260461 i was pretty well backed off of it by a lot of folks here in america who care deeply about the issue once you make that decision you have to rely upon an international organisation like the united nations to provide the oomph
260462 it is a decision i am now living with and it is a decision that requires us to continue to rally the conscience of the world
260463 it is only in the united states that a penniless survivor of the holocaust and a fighter in the anti nazi underground could have received an education raised a family and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a member of congress i will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country
260464 defined by courage optimism and unwavering dedication to his principles and to his family
260465 the world is running out of patience over whats going in darfur
260466 not to do things that will cause the international community to impose sanctions on them
260467 to link the darfur issue to the olympics is a move to politicize the olympics and this is inconsistent with the olympics spirit and will bear no fruit
260468 all i can say is that they were school age
260469 people are fighting each other and trying to drive them out of the area we have to evacuate people
260470 the government is doing this to try to influence mediation efforts
260471 after stealing the elections from kenyans kibaki now wishes to deny them justice and peace
260472 what is really happening is a continuation of the ethnic cleansing that railas people are doing to kill the presidents people
260473 for the umpteenth time we again ask president kibaki and orange democratic movement leader mr raila odinga to work for peace truth and justice
260474 the necessary weapons and ammunition to exterminate the african tribes in darfur
260475 they shoved a guard and tried to force a gate and behaved in a very rude way
260476 my heart our hearts are breaking for what happened in cambodia today especially for the survivors of genocide
260477 our goal today was to deliver these flowers in deepest respect to honor those who have perished here in cambodia and in darfur and in all genocides everywhere
260478 why dont they just go to china to do that
260479 its pretty harsh to be against a ceremony that honors the victims of darfur and genocide survivors everywhere
260480 our resolve is still the same which is to go forward
260481 its really difficult how anyone can be against honoring survivors of genocide particularly as cambodians
260482 we do not want to see any trouble or confrontation with them said touch naroth the police chief for cambodias capital phnom penh but we simply cannot let this group breach the law either
260483 the olympic games are not a political issue therefore we wont allow any rally to light a torch
260484 we will not support the activity we will not allow them to politicise the olympic games
260485 the symbolic olympic torch relay is urging the chinese government as both olympic host and sudans strongest political and economic partner to use its special influence with the sudanese government
260486 ci auguriamo che il tutto non si risolva nel classico fumo negli occhi

260495 the northern side is marked by all that is lovely rich and picturesque the southern side abounds in bold wild rocks precipitous projections ravines fearful chasms
260496 in recent years theres been a shift in philosophy about how to manage the coast
260497 theres a realisation that we must work with nature to do that we need a better understanding of the natural processes that shape the coast
260498 we have lots of sophisticated tools for monitoring how the coast is changing now old maps can provide some useful information about the past but they are often inaccurate
260499 theres nothing that enables us to look back centuries except perhaps artworks

260502 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
260503 but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years

260539 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
260540 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
260541 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
260542 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot
260543 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
260544 the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front
260545 it was with a porn star i dont know her name
260546 she probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens
260547 dealing with the press is something that youve gotta start getting used to
260548 and you know people want something to talk about so theyre going to have the two disney girls or three disney girls kind of feuding

260557 something sexy and edgy something where i get to use a knife
260558 it was pretty much the same with the last record
260559 weve been working on acoustic guitars and then trying to bring it all together as a full band were not sure whats going to happen yet but weve been having a lot of fun we havent stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about
260560 its sounding pretty awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record
260561 weve got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year
260562 i can tell you its on our latest record its in the middle somewhere
260563 we are always interested in any kind of workshop that is empowering and will encourage girls to feel like they can do anything
260564 they can create their own environment and be creative in the risks that they take
260565 if you can find other girls to play with its not just a bonding experience its not just about the music its sort of this big empowerment thing
260566 its a confidence builder youre playing and youre gelling together on a stage in front of people who are pumping you up and its just a really big empowerment and confidence booster
260567 we actually put a bunch of names in a little baggy and drew out four or five random words and put them together and we wrote down about 40 different possible names
260568 we were down to finding nowhere and broken media and we all voted for broken media
260569 total teenage drama its like us making fun of girls because we say they are talking on their cell phones listening to the radio looking in the mirror and trying to fix their hair
260570 we thought we should make it about people who would say lol
260571 you dont really believe in the concept of personal space do you
260572 box office observers believe director rob cohens remains a juggernaut as it heads into its third session
260573 i knew it was going to turn heads and that it was going to make a statement and we really appreciate that
260574 weve always been a band thats had things about us and things that are going on that creates big bold waves and whats so weird about the perception of the crusade is we wanted to show people that were not just a band thats going to stick to the same formula every time on that record we accomplished our main goal and that was to make it the exact opposite of 2005s ascendancy we didnt want to do anything that happened on that record on the next one but we still wanted to keep it us because we feel were a band that can broaden its sound and not just stick with one thing it was still metal and it was still trivium just different and diversified
260575 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
260576 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as
260577 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
260578 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed
260579 we decided to take an old school approach to the record using new school technology purely for convenience because tape takes so f ing long to record with
260580 nick made us play this record the way metal is done these days you track it a couple of times make sure its perfect and then you go in and fix a couple of the pieces retrigger the guitars and drums thats just the way it is but we wanted to go back to the old school way record everything right with no triggers on our drums we had to make sure the performance was there and the energy was there and hearing the end result the stuff nick drew out of us is just unreal in terms of heaviness and brutality its the best thing weve done before wed never really considered ourselves a contender for even the word heavy or brutal but this time things are different
260581 just a big combination of everything wed loved as kids
260582 everyone weve played it for theyre all really excited about it
260583 i think weve found our sound weve just discovered it and with the next one i think well define it it takes a band a little while to find their sound some bands get it on the first record and some bands it takes several i think were one of those bands thats going to develop and fully come into our sound someday we dont know what record that will be but this record is even closer to what its going to be
260584 everywhere we go there are these gay and lesbian activists who chase everyone and have their newsletters everywhere
260585 the north americans brought all of these activists to the conference and they are blaming us for focusing attention on the issue of homosexuality
260586 you cannot count them in the marketplace they are everyplace we go to eat
260587 our sample was self selected from people who already claimed they had made some change we dont know how common that kind of change is im not saying that this can be easily done or that most homosexuals who want to change can make this kind of change i suspect its quite unusual
260588 i suspect the vast majority of gay people would be unable to alter by much a firmly established homosexual orientation
260589 it bothers me to be their knight in shining armor because on every social issue i totally disagree with the christian right what they dont mention is that change is pretty rare

260655 yo creo que el d a de hoy ha sucedido un hecho que va a cambiar la manera como se venia desarrollando este a o y es el madrugonazo de las leyes habilitantes que de manera totalmente tracalera el gobierno est publicando de un d a para otro
260656 el gobierno tenia 18 meses con una habilitante y no hab a hecho sino leyes para condecoraciones y el d a de hoy de un plumazo mete el tema de la reforma por contrabando que era lo que primero justicia venia reclamando y yo creo que sa es la mejor raz n por la cual el pa s entero tiene que entender que las elecciones del 23 de noviembre es la oportunidad para cambiar de ra z la estructura de poder que tenemos en venezuela
260657 hay que meterle un freno en seco este a o al gobierno con esta reforma de contrabando que acaba de aparecer y la mejor forma de hacerlo es ganando gobernaciones y alcald as

260781 with increased upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations members believed that the next change in the stance of policy could well be an increase in the funds rate
260782 theres definitely a sense that inflation is becoming too high for comfort
260783 but the fed has to live in the reality that the economy is weakening and the financial markets are still not back to normal they have a very difficult road to pass through
260784 the pace of economic activity slowed somewhat since the last report
260785 with inflation risks on the rise the scope for monetary policy to be supportive of financial stability has become more constrained
260786 the fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place
260787 they cant raise rates which is what they probably should do the fed will continue to jawbone and threaten to raise rates but in a finance based economy where the system is broke they just cant do it
260788 accurately assessing and appropriately balancing the risks to the outlook for growth and inflation is a significant challenge for monetary policy makers

260796 praised mccain for his support of florida issues such as a national catastrophic fund for disasters
260797 i do not support a national catastrophic insurance policy that insurance policy is there and its called fema and its called national disaster preparedness i still do not have confidence that fema is capable of handling those responsibilities
260798 i campaigned in florida against the national catastrophic insurance fund bill that passed the house of representatives
260799 the arizona senator has long opposed the creation of a national fund to help insurers cover catastrophic damage from natural disasters

260801 mccain also faced criticism for opposing a national catastrophic insurance fund for hurricane prone states democrats noted that crist who gave mccain a critical boost by endorsing him just before the florida primary last january had lobbied congress for the fund his predecessor as governor jeb bush also backed the fun mccain has said he would instead bring industry and government together to protect homeowners his spokesman tucker bounds said thursday that the government run fund would ignore the need for reforms of the private insurance market to make sure everyone can get coverage
260802 is resisting calls to back the program this is a very large federal program and the only state currently in a position to benefit is florida said douglas holtz eakin mr mccains policy director mr mccain who opposed the federal catastrophe plan received 690 000 from individuals in the insurance industry 9 000 from allstate employees and 21 000 from employees of state farm
260803 the bush administration said wednesday it opposes a national catastrophic insurance fund even as gov
260804 the administrations uncompromising opposition is disappointing the creation of an emergency fund deserves a hearing in congress and the president need not get in the way
260805 president should stay out of fight to create federal disaster fund
260806 the work of the florida state legislature has begun to address the insurance crisis in our state but federal action is also necessary i implore congress to take the next step to ensure the affordability and availability of property insurance a federal catastrophe fund would provide protection for american homeowners throughout the nation a national program would spread the risk across the country thus strengthening our insurance markets capital for the plan could come from a portion of the property insurance premiums already collected by insurance companies the funds could grow tax free provide the financial capability to cope with the catastrophic risk and allow affected regions the ability to recover more quickly from natural disasters this federal backstop for insurers is an essential step to addressing the insurance crisis

260857 being able to design microfluidic devices in a multi layer format gives us the freedom to make far more complex devices
260858 at the moment we are primarily working with 3 layer devices but already this offers the possibility to massively improve the performance and throughput of our devices e g our droplet generation chip and our reactor chips we now have the potential to create a chip that could produce in excess of 32 000 droplets per second for industries such as drug discovery and drug development this level of microfluidic technology is very exciting news
260859 the big challenge with multi layer development has been achieving viable yield during multilaminated fusing steps
260860 in this respect the manufacturing process can be quite challenging however we now have the technology and processes in place to deliver the complexity and quality that this market is moving towards
260861 another exciting aspect of this development is that the specific benefits of microfluidics such as the accuracy and small size format can now be applied to production throughput for the first time
260862 we can number up the processes in a chip maybe even a hundred times this will enable the chip to deliver production level throughput which are currently undertaken using more traditional batch processes that may be lower quality and less accurate

260914 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price ofhomes which appears to be happening in california
260915 since california constitutes 25 percent of the housingstock in the u s any stabilization can have a profound impacton national averages
260916 by extension a stabilization in home prices is requiredbefore any sustainable rally in financials can be expected

260940 we havent really felt the impact of economic developments on our business thus far
260941 were in a kind of business where we know that people would much rather cut down on other areas of discretionary spend before they decide to either down trade or cut down on their overall daily cigarette consumption
260942 while not immune from the consequences of an economic slowdown we can certainly look to the future with more confidence than most
260943 the company says it has scoured the world to see if the slowing economies in the developed world or higher commodity and fuel prices are having any impact
260944 the fact there is no significant impact should reassure investors

260948 with the lack of affordable and supportive housing as well as inadequate income to meet current living costs chronic homelessness and poverty will continue to rise in our city
260949 the kelowna rcmp were called to a residence in the ellison area by the owner who found out the go kart had been dropped off by acquaintances of a friend of his son
260950 the owner immediately called the kelowna rcmp to report the items being there two males in the local area were questioned by police as persons of interest and determined not to be involved
260951 the go kart is not the one belonging to marcus brodie unfortunately however this does offer the hope that his will be recovered shortly
260952 im so disappointed in people that somebody can actually do something like this but i also feel that people actually care after learning that one of the karts has been recovered

260970 they have also accepted to donate the rest of his organs to save greek people
260971 it is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me
260972 i believe that this fact seriously jeopardises the trial itself
260973 i do not know how long the arm of mr holbrooke is or whether that arm can reach me here
260974 hes one of the greatest mass murderers of the world and hes putting this out in order to defend himself its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
260975 what i said was if anyone deserves the death penalty its karadzic and mladic
260976 that was my specific reference and if karadzic is in the hague and is still scared that i have an arm that long i guess i should treat it in a backhanded way as a compliment
260977 proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs
260978 we got up early for prayers and i went down to have a wash
260979 a strong whistling sound came up from the ground floor
260980 and five minutes later a strong gas smell took over the dormitories followed by the deafening explosion
260981 judging by the burns we have seen on the injured we think that the building collapsed because a gas container exploded
260982 theres a bit of pressure ryan cross played an outstanding game last weekend
260983 weve always had a squad of 30 mentality and all 30 guys are really pitching in to our efforts so ive got to make sure i perform this weekend thats for sure
260984 the mindset is to bring everything we can to our performance and thats what everyones been doing whether theyve been playing for 50 test matches or this is their first few test matches
260985 guys have been bringing whatever they can to the performance of the team and thats the mindset
260986 if you do that then hopefully that will contribute to a positive result
260987 you just work hard and toil away adding to what you do try and retain what youve built
260988 thats been great in terms of how weve added things but retained them
260989 these guys have a great work ethic great passion for what they do and theyre sharp theyre quick on the uptake and the fact that we havent had those undulations has been really encouraging but also a necessity
260990 its slowly been gradual that belief and thats whats been really good about this group its pretty tight and weve been spending a lot of time with each other and everybody pretty much gets on
260991 i know you say that in pretty much every team but were pretty tight and i think thats gone a long way to making us perform well for each other on the field
260992 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the us economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our us operations
260993 the second quarter this year has been one of the fastest changing markets i have ever seen
260994 we have the right plan for gm driven by great products building strong brands fuel economy technology leadership and taking full advantage of global growth opportunities
260995 on balance a weak set of results but not as bad as headlines suggest
260996 john mccain knows which side his bread is buttered on and thats the jewish side of campaign contributions
260997 metals such as cobalt are extracted under dangerous conditions in the congolese mines by both adults and children workers often have no safety equipment and are not receiving a decent living wage
260998 politicians military and militia groups have plundered the countrys natural wealth and used it to enrich themselves at the detriment of the population

261000 republican jewish official spends day lying to reporters about obama
261001 suzanne kurtz communications director for the republican jewish coalition spent her afternoon knowingly misleading if not downright lying to reporters
261002 it would be a mistake for the jewish community not to show our appreciation to the president
261003 i supported george bush in 2004 because of his support for israel and i support barack obama in 2008 because of his
261004 unlike reagan clinton and bush obama can point to many concrete votes on legislation important to israel
261005 he has gone as far as any candidate in history in innumerable speeches and statements highlighting his commitment to the us israel partnership and the security of the jewish state
261006 theres a solid support for obama in the jewish community
261007 iranians need to understand that whether its the bush administration or an obama administration that this is a paramount concern to the united states
261008 will take no options off the table in dealing with this potential iranian threat
261009 the central front in the war on terror is not iraq and it never was
261010 he has been consistent in his belief that the united states must responsibly refocus its attention in the war on terror
261011 must be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in
261012 senator mccain has said that jerusalem is the capital of israel if a democratic government of israel chooses to accept an alteration of that status hes certainly not going to second guess a democratic government of israel
261013 that he wanted to encourage adoption and make the process easier but that adoptive parents should be mixed sex traditional couples
261014 senator mccains expressed his personal preference for children to be raised by a mother and a father wherever possible
261015 he recognizes that there are many abandoned children who have yet to find homes john mccain believes that in those situations that caring parental figures are better for the child than the alternative
261016 well so and so is not so good on israel but hes great on other issues so ill support him anyway
261017 the constitution established the united states of america has a christian nation
261018 senator obama has spoken eloquently about the growing danger of the iranian nuclear program
261019 the united states must use both carrots and sticks negotiations and economic pressure to let the iranians know that their current nuclear program is unacceptable
261020 on the bush administrations watch weve seen a terrorist organization rise to power in gaza the democratic party should join the international community and senator obama in endorsing language that makes clear that we should isolate hamas until it renounces terrorism recognizes israels right to exist and abides by past agreements between israel and the palestinians
261021 the american jewish community like the vast majority of all americans recognizes that the last seven and a half years of this republican administration has been a disaster for the united states we urge this committee to rely upon the democratic partys 2004 platform and the positions of senator obama to continue to support the u s israel relationship and to highlight all the vast policy differences that separate the democratic party and the intellectually bankrupt republican party
261022 to the security of our ally israel and the creation of a comprehensive just and lasting peace between israel and her neighbors
261023 special relationship with israel that is based on the unshakable foundation of shared values and a mutual commitment to democracy
261024 qualitative edge for its national security and its right to self defense
261025 the capital of israel and should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths
261026 full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949
261027 take effective steps to stop the north korean and iranian nuclear programs
261028 t here is no greater threat to the peace and stability of the middle east than iran
261029 i will do everything in my power to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon everything
261030 its not a happy choice it is our moral duty and our heartfelt wish to see the soldiers come back
261031 he was impressed about obamas understanding of the iranian threat and said they both agreed that a nuclear iran was unacceptable
261032 stressed that they also agreed what was important was the ends of preventing a nuclear iran rather than the means and that when it comes to stopping iran there were no politics
261033 ill never compromise israels security terrorism is not theoretical its right here a block away from this hotel and it must be fought with full force and strength
261034 where am i did i just miss the turn i was looking for
261035 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
261036 were going to get the second quarter behind us and just move ahead
261037 but ultimately were going to have to grow the business in a tough market
261038 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations
261039 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public
261040 if you read the literature it says the vipers bites are pretty benign
261041 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad
261042 usted ha dicho que el madrid no tiene dinero para fichar a ronaldo
261043 i will do everything in my power to help the cincinnati bengals win a super bowl
261044 i think theyre putting me in the right position outside linebacker its going to be good rushing the passer on pretty much every down its a good fit
261045 it was so hot that every time the door opened it gave me some cool air as for being black flagged because of it well shit happens as they say
261046 weve had a few things go wrong but at the end of the day we have had an enjoyable weekend and it was a big meeting for us with potential sponsors and friends and family we had 70 people who enjoyed the racing the weather was good and they all enjoyed it which is what its all about
261047 today the gop asked for continued debate on oil drilling the democrats voted instead to adjourn
261048 ill just go to disk utility and reformat the drive all will be well
261049 the easy and gracious living style afforded leisure time for politics and the arts
261050 when he saw the back and jackson pond he said this isnt a townhouse feeling
261051 we get kudos from the neighbors for making our courtyard so special
261052 when i saw the unit across from the community garden with a view of the cathedral i was sold right away
261053 we have always found life here to be so comfortable
261054 ten or 12 of us watched the sopranos together every sunday night over potluck dinners
261055 when you walked on the kitchen floor in wintertime you got cold feet
261056 its surprising but i think that people are afraid to spend the money that initial outlay of cash is difficult under the current economic situation
261057 the optimum months are as soon as the rain starts in early october through december deciduous trees you would want to plant after they go dormant and have lost their leaves
261058 they dont need to be that close to the house to prevent wind
261059 any time materials can be layered more protection will be afforded
261060 i have to take issue with your article in which you make clear your abhorrence of coercive tactics to enforce dues payments
261061 i determined that we could legally shut off water to the offending units and we proceeded to do so in a matter of a few months the delinquencies were either paid up or the owners sold and moved and through liens we recouped the monies owed
261062 is shutting off water harsh you bet but it worked and the deadbeats always had the option of going elsewhere to bathe if coercion wasnt needed most associations would not resort to it believe me its the weapon of last not first resort
261063 i am certain a bestseller either humorous or otherwise could be published documenting the missing link decisions foisted upon helpless residents thus far courts have come down in favor of the rules of condo associations no matter the undemocratic or in some cases criminal level actions taken by condo boards
261064 my wife and i are planning to downsize into a condo in a couple of years and have started familiarizing ourselves with condos in the area as best we can it is amazingly difficult to get information real estate agents and many times the sellers are clueless you said you need to assure yourself that its personality is one you can live with how in the world can that be done
261065 other boards have tried this turning off air conditioning electricity water around the country and the local board of health usually swings in and stops it please suggest to that condo owner that he contact his county board of health if such an action is even threatened again
261066 i have worked on at least a dozen and am probably going to close on one or two they have been disastrous
261067 let me say short sales are not difficult at all if the seller is organized the seller will receive short sale approval in no more than four weeks sometimes even within a couple of weeks depending on the lender involved
261068 loss mitigation departments will not do anything with a distressed owner seller unless they have a ratified contract how are you going to start an approval process with the lender when there is nothing to approve
261069 upon sale you may only get back 81 percent of the investment in a basic bathroom remodeling lets say the cost is 15 000 so the seller recoups approximately 12 000 and is out 3 000 however failure to remodel the bathroom may lead the prospective buyer especially in the current atmosphere to bid considerably more than 3 000 lower than the asking price this would lead the seller to be out much more than the 3 000 your thoughts
261070 w e live in baltimore and are trying to sell our house
261071 my agent tells me that my listing has to be withdrawn from the local multiple listing service for at least six months otherwise the number of days on market will carry forward from my old listing to a new listing our house has been on the market for nine months and were trying to find a way not to show that in the mls
261072 at mris if a new listing for a particular property is added 91 days after any previous listing was withdrawn or expired it will be considered a new listing the history of days any previous listing was on the market will not attach to this new listing
261073 hourglass bends and tapering profiles displaying the computer generated irregular geometry that has become gehrys signature
261074 fifteen years ago it would have been difficult and in some cases impossible to engineer the buildings in these pages
261075 the rectilinear glass box has become a quaint relic of the pre digital past
261076 i dont think numbers like an 880 billion equity loss are all that meaningful for most individual homeowners
261077 materially less favorable than the most favorable terms available to a substantial portion of consumers obtaining credit from or through
261078 i think its very speculative for a seller to put a lot of money into a property in todays market without knowing if it will be to everyones taste
261079 we wanted to live in the annapolis area but wanted something that was convenient to the washington area since we both worked there we thought it was the best of both worlds
261080 you have senior citizens you have middle age you have young professionals you have people with children it is not a cookie cutter community there is a lot of diversity it is great
261081 i would say naturally the area has changed since more younger people are coming in
261082 there were not that many children here for a long time
261083 we looked at 28 other houses but we kept coming back to this when we lived in san francisco we were newlyweds i knew i didnt want to have kids living out there you had to drive halfway across town to get grass under your feet nobody has a yard
261084 it is not one of those neighborhoods where everyone keeps to themselves
261085 people kind of want to know each other that was the attitude when the community started there are a lot of community activities
261086 i met my husband dave and we rented a townhouse in crofton we were there a couple of years and decided it was time to buy
261087 it was a foreclosure it was just a mess but my husband is a man of vision and we were brave and at the time we had no children
261088 its in a rustic wooded area that isnt totally groomed people leave work on friday go to the grocery store and liquor store go home and dont leave till monday
261089 it is the first and only house i ever lived in
261090 it wasnt a development per se then people bought the lots then built thats why all the houses are different
261091 if the pier falls down were all out there with a hammer
261092 the elders who kind of pulled us in and said we dont pay for things we do it ourselves
261093 we had been looking in shaw but we didnt know the name other than not quite
261094 some people think the name will harm their property values
261095 the longtimers and the people sensitive to the neighborhoods history will still call it shaw
261096 i was surprised by how much black history there was right here
261097 boomers are much more active than their parents were they are amenity migrants not sun migrants theyre not necessarily going to buy a house on a beach but will look at all the amenities in the area
261098 i would love to have one in almost any one of my designs
261099 it seems in every house she designed she put in elements that are uniquely different
261100 my husband fell in love with it it was a one of a kind house it was a dream for us
261101 espousing loopholes and advocating financial prudence and less pain instead of moral and financial obligations is exactly whats wrong with this economy and america in general this thinking is why ivy league executives feel no hesitation to take advantage of any financial situation in front of them it is why borrowers feel its perfectly okay to walk away from their responsibilities to creditors capitalism works a whole lot better for all of us when people live up to their obligations i for one hope the post exercises financial prudence and decides not to pay you for this trash
261102 your article was spot on this is exactly what these builders are doing they would rather offer incentives free options reduced financing etc than lower their prices due to the precedent they would set and to avoid upsetting buyers who may have paid more and settled recently
261103 i am shocked that the agent from a big brokerage company has not seen builders demand for promissory notes maybe it is public relations
261104 i myself purchased a condo for my son in alexandria i paid more than 20 000 when i signed the contract i lost my job after a year and i told them i could not get a loan i even tried their lender and they wanted me to get a 20 percent down payment from a home equity line of credit on my house they could give me the loan with no income verification they did not care if i could pay the payment for both loans i spent 5 000 on attorneys fees and i still have to give them 20 000 for the note i really wanted to buy and it was unfortunate that i lost my job before closing
261105 i feel so sorry for some of these people who have been falling for what i call tricks by real estate agents and new home builders i worked in this field between 2000 2003 and i can tell you i have seen lots of real estate agents just flat out lie and steal and get away with it
261106 as youve described the situation for some purchasers they are looking at losing their deposit even though they cant get a mortgage for the amount they need let alone that they cant get a mortgage for the rate they might have locked in
261107 and it adds a very nice tidy appearance to the landscape
261108 its not like one is better or worse than others

261111 it will tend to wash away if you put it on a hillside after a good heavy thunderstorm your mulch is all down at the bottom of the hill

261114 now we know how were going to pay our college tuition bills down the road
261115 the bottom line is rates are lower than they were

261120 but a board member doing it without notifying the community was against the regulations
261121 the board members would go and collect proxies and they would vote for who they wanted
261122 my main objection was how they went about doing it
261123 i fear giving it to my children directly unless i boil it
261124 iraq is on the cusp of a serious water crisis that requires immediate attention and resources
261125 up to now we have seen nothing from the government

261130 whether you go to foreclosure or not it does a lot of damage to your credit score
261131 with the short sale at least the customer was at the table in a foreclosure they were not
261132 it is an alternative that some realtors will push on a customer
261133 the realtor still makes a profit on a short sale
261134 we will try to negotiate an unsecured note for at least some of it
261135 yeah the homestake but you never told me to sell

261138 my boss is not going to be happy because now im going to spend even more time here
261139 ive been coming here for three years and ive never seen it like this
261140 the layoffs are unfortunate everyone has to work its like a domino effect
261141 people need money so they come to us but they dont have the money to pay back
261142 what is unusual is all of a sudden they closed early
261143 for me its a headache because i have to come every month
261144 the tail of the line is usually inside not way out here
261145 its starting to look that way but we dont know for sure
261146 it will give the staff an idea of how many people to expect
261147 the confederate flag is offensive in many many ways as we all know its a symbol of racism and slavery

261158 american author kathleen parkers courageous thesis is that initially through extreme feminism then via its craven implementation into society women have demonised men and trivialised their contribution especially to family life
261159 i say courageous because in the eyes of many women and of the liberal establishment suggesting men have had a rough deal is nothing short of heresy
261160 parker should be burnt at the stake they cry but isnt it ironic that only a woman could make such a plea for men
261161 she argues as long as men feel marginalised by the women whose favour and approval they seek as long as they are alienated from their children and treated as criminals by family courts as long as they are disrespected by a culture that no longer values masculinity tied to honour as long as boys are bereft of strong fathers and our young men and women wage sexual war then we risk cultural suicide
261162 for years sierra has been nothing more than a logo slapped on whatever box vivendi games thought it would help sell better it was sierra in name only they allowed the brand to wither into meaninglessness
261163 why not do to the brand what its owners did to the people who created it
261164 i really dont know what sierra even is these days
261165 i suppose i should be disappointed anytime i hear that sierra is being shut down but it really doesnt bother me
261166 the company was horribly mismanaged for a long time and it depresses me more every time i hear about a dumb decision being made than it does when i hear that someone did the right thing even when it includes killing off a brand or reducing staff size
261167 not bad for a 49 year old nearly at my half century its all downhill from here
261168 youve done all these amazing things what is the best thing you have ever done in your life

261177 the only abuse that ever occurred in their household was that of emotional abuse inflicted upon ranae and her dog lacy on the occasions when he hit ranae and her dog with his reaching sticks or kicked them when having one of his drunken rages

261183 the delays in purchases reflect economic anxieties far more than they do competitive positioning
261184 they have a client base largely comprised of telecom government and financial services customers and those segments have really slowed buying

261187 we now enter yet another year where sun is hoping to grow slightly and expand its margins
261188 its been trying to do that the last three or four years so theres less and less investor confidence in the company
261189 most people buy on price they want to buy from the biggest vendors because they will give them the best deal in a down economy its an even harder sell for sun
261190 they have an expectation that their customers want to put it together and figure out how it works
261191 part of the problem is that they they havent done enough to reach out to the right partners to build an out of the box ecosystem of products they think too much about technology and need to think more about how all those pieces will work together

261215 fabrikanten luisteren eindelijk naar de grote groep klanten die juist een eenvoudiger toestel wil de tijd is voorbij dat de markt werd overspoeld met steeds ingewikkelder telefoons er ontstaat veel grotere verscheidenheid in het aanbod
261216 als een consument niet met een apparaat uit de voeten kan heeft hij niet de neiging om een nieuwe te kopen hoe sneller hij een telefoon helemaal begrijpt hoe sneller hij behoefte heeft aan een mobiel die net wat meer biedt
261217 zolang ik hier in de kroeg met de andere jongens m jn biertje kan drinken en mijn potje kan biljarten vind ik het allang mooi
261218 er wordt gepraat er wordt nog weer eens een commissie ingesteld er wordt n g een keer overlegd er wordt niet doorgepakt er is geen daadkracht
261219 waar is de politicus die zegt en z gaan we het doen
261220 dat is tenslotte je plicht maar ze binden dat niet aan de hoopvolle verwachting dat alle problemen spoedig worden opgelost ze brengen hun stem uit zeggen wat ze van bepaalde ontwikkelingen vinden en moeten daarna snel verder met al hun drukke bezigheden
261221 ik wil niet zeuren en zeggen dat vroeger alles beter was maar eigenlijk is dat wel zo
261222 wilders en verdonk nooit van mn leven zal ik erop stemmen maar het klinkt wel leuk het husselt die haagse boel wel mooi op in ieder geval
261223 wie in nederland ontevreden is moet eigenlijk een klap voor zn hersens krijgen tien uur vliegen en je ziet wat echte ellende is
261224 even wachten of een praatje van twee minuten kost mensen tegenwoordig blijkbaar geld
261225 jongeren hebben nu alles en ze geven anderen de schuld als ze het niet hebben ik kom uit de generatie van na de oorlog voor ons kon het allemaal eigenlijk alleen maar beter worden
261226 waarom lukt het de politiek niet die problemen aan te pakken ik weet het niet stemmen doen we nog steeds maar dat het iets uitmaakt ik heb er steeds minder vertrouwen in
261227 tegelijkertijd veel mensen in nederland willen ook te veel ik ben mijn leven lang gewoon huisvrouw geweest maar tegenwoordig kan dat niet meer zeggen ze dan want ja zon gezin wil in een groot huis en een grote auto en twee drie keer per jaar op vakantie
261228 ik wil dat er een politicus komt die zegt en z gaan we het doen een beetje zoals fortuyn het deed
261229 dat je op een bijeenkomst met een goed idee komt en dat de voorzitter dan al na een minuut wilt u afronden roept dat vind ik kortzichtig en het schept geen band tussen gemeente en burgers
261230 nederland behoort tot de tien meest vrije landen van de wereld maar dat zegt meer over de situatie elders in 150 landen is het n g erger als je ziek bent voel je je niet beter omdat negen anderen nog zieker zijn je wilt gez nd zijn
261231 de overheid functioneert door middel van dwang en dreiging met geweld ze stalkt je het hele jaar door met controles en wil daar dan voor worden betaald door belastingen te heffen en met die belastingen doet ze vervolgens nutteloze en contraproductieve dingen
261232 de gemiddelde nederlander geeft de helft van zijn inkomen uit aan belastingen zou de overheid alles rechtstreeks bij de burger heffen dan zou je een gigantische belastingopstand krijgen
261233 ambtenaren en politici roepen altijd om het hardst dat ego sme slecht is en dat de sterkste schouders de zwaarste lasten moeten dragen maar zij l ven van belastinggeld wat krijgen we daar voor terug wegen vol files slechte scholen wachtlijsten in de gezondheidszorg en een politie die geen inbreker kan vinden als je niet zelf zijn naam en adres kan overhandigen
261234 de overheid is een criminele organisatie die alleen kan voortbestaan als mensen belasting betalen dat maakt het voor mij immoreel om g n belasting te ontwijken
261235 er zijn bijna geen hollandse winkels meer over in amsterdam
261236 ze worden gefinancierd vanuit turkije en marokko en gaan vaak onder de prijs zitten
261237 hartstikke goed hoor dat ze die mensen een doel geven maar daar valt niet mee te concurreren daarom verdwijnen nederlandse ondernemers uit het straatbeeld
261238 want een half miljoen is veel geld maar het is ook zo op
261239 daar heb je zon gewiekste reclamejongen dachten veel mensen de raad van advies die we hebben ingesteld waarin ook wim naeije voormalig bestuursvoorzitter van eneco zit draagt bij aan vertrouwen in de behoudende energiesector
261240 maar ik kijk niet naar de huidige situatie wel naar de beweging duurzaamheid is zo langzaamaan de standaard aan het worden

261246 het is ontzettend moeilijk om complexe technologie te vertalen in een eenvoudig te bedienen apparaat de techniek op zich is niet meer het knelpunt er is al zoveel technologische kennis opgebouwd dat voor elk probleem een oplossing te bedenken is het moeilijke is om die techniek toegankelijk te maken voor grote groepen gebruikers daarom is veel onderzoek nu gericht op communicatietechnologie en gebruiksgemak
261247 philips gaat bij het ontwikkelen van producten niet meer alleen uit van de aanwezige technische kennis maar van het dagelijks leven van mensen en de problemen waar zij mee te maken hebben door je als bedrijf in de leefwereld van mensen te begeven kom je erachter waar behoefte aan is de behoeftes van grote groepen mensen bepalen de richting van ons onderzoek en het zijn juist weer technische ontwikkelingen als internet die deze manier van marktonderzoek mogelijk maken
261248 je oma zette vroeger een lampje achter de televisie omdat turen naar de beeldbuis anders zo vermoeiend was voor je ogen van dat soort logica is uitgegaan bij het ontwikkelen van de ambilight televisie die zelf licht verspreidt in de ruimte achter het beeldscherm
261249 hoe eenvoudiger iets is in gebruik des te complexer is vaak de techniek die erachter zit neem de auto voor de eerste auto had de bestuurder veel kennis van de motor nodig om het ding aan de gang te houden nu zijn autos computers op vier wielen de techniek is veel complexer terwijl het gebruiksgemak voor de bestuurder veel groter is daar gaan we ook naar toe in onze dagelijkse leef en werkomgeving slimme technologie begrijpt onze behoeftes en speelt daar op in
261250 het kan zeer frustrerend zijn als je een nieuw toestel koopt dat je niet aan de gang krijgt ik heb zelf afgelopen weekend twintig minuten zitten pielen om het klepje voor de batterij van mijn nieuwe telefoon open te krijgen ik durfde niemand om hulp te vragen ik ben tenslotte directeur van belcompany mensen ergeren zich aan van die onlogische ingewikkelde toestanden
261251 als je een apparaat niet begrijpt zul je ook niet snel een nieuwe kopen hoe sneller de consument een apparaat begrijpt en leert gebruiken hoe sneller hij geneigd is over te stappen naar een model dat net wat beter is
261252 ik voelde me er heel ongemakkelijk onder zo zwaar de meeste kinderen hadden een leuk onderwerp genomen nanda stelt zich heel kwetsbaar op
261253 ze hebben me wel eens tegen mijn benen geschopt toen had ik blauwe plekken
261254 die laag in hun iq zitten en de wereld om zich heen niet zo goed begrijpen
261255 het is moeilijk om te vergelijken vroeger werden die kinderen weggestopt dan zag je ze helemaal niet op straat
261256 ik wil ze vragen stellen over mij hoe ze over me denken hoe ze het vinden om mij te hebben of ze vinden dat ik zelfstandig genoeg ben om voor mezelf te zorgen
261257 heftig nieuws ligt de volgende dag ook in de kattenbak maar ja je kunt ook helemaal niets doen dan verlopen de spelen straks heel smooth en krijgt china allemaal complimenten ondertussen onderdrukt het land de eigen bevolking en tibetanen we komen misschien wat laat met dit programma maar ik denk dat het nooit te laat is voor een tegengeluid
261258 ik won destijds vier gouden medailles en kreeg een fiets cadeau
261259 dat was het er zijn wel belangrijkere dingen dan sport
261260 het feit alleen al dat mensen daar niet mogen zeggen wat ze vinden vind ik schokkend dat neemt alleen maar toe naarmate de spelen dichterbij komen waarom hoor je daar zo weinig sporters over
261261 ze hebben toch ook hersens ze lezen toch ook kranten
261262 ik vermoed dat de atleten zich scharen achter het algemene credo brand er maar niet je vingers aan ga maar gewoon voor de sport
261263 je zag een tijdje terug aan erik van muiswinkel hoe kwetsbaar je bent als je aan de tafel van pauw en witteman discussies aangaat
261264 ik vond het dapper hoor maar ik kies liever voor deze vorm ge ngageerd cabaret ja
261265 ik snap erica terpstra wel dat je het sporters niet aan kunt doen om ze niet naar de spelen te laten gaan ze trainen er tenslotte jaren voor t ch zou ik het een prima signaal vinden als een vrij en westers land afwezig blijft het is toch raar om in china gezellig op de tribune te zitten terwijl je zelf vrijheid en mensenrechten zo hoog in het vaandel hebt staan en dat terpstra denkt dat sport daar bruggen slaat vind ik een na eve westerse gedachte
261266 vooral de praatprogrammas om de sport heen ik ben wel benieuwd of sporters zich dan wel kritisch uiten
261267 dat is makkelijk en zuur we brengen dit onderwerp op een ludieke manier onder de aandacht en dan impliceert het misschien inconsequenties so what bij het maken is er niemand doodgemaakt en heeft er zich geen dierenleed afgespeeld in china worden mensen voor hun mening opgepakt

261274 its been 65 years since the sullivan brothers were lost at sea during the battle at guadalcanal which spurred the establishment of a sole survivor policy since that time congress has made a lot of changes to the benefits available to separating servicemen in all that time no law has been passed on behalf of sole survivors the hubbard act rectifies this oversight and honors the patriotic service and enormous sacrifice of the hubbards

261302 hice abundante cosecha de esqueletos y craneos en los cementerios de los indigenas sometidos que vivian en las inmediaciones del azul y en blanca grande
261303 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge
261304 vi que est n empobrecidos que sus tierras est n secas que detr s de las forestales hay todo un aparataje pol tico pol tico militar y vi que la industria forestal se gasta toda la plata que sea necesaria para acallar a cualquier persona que se rebele contra el sistema los allanamientos a las comunidades mapuches son constantes y terribles yo creo que algunos todav a buscan entre los mapuches a ese terrorista que imagin pinochet un terrorista que nunca van a encontrar en la zona mapuche porque no existe
261305 no me dejaron hablar con un abogado en 24 horas no me dijeron de qu se me acusaba
261306 estoy presa por mi trabajo profesional como cineasta por la informaci n que manejo por interactuar con activistas mapuches que luchan por lo que creen por entrevistar a personas de comunidades mapuches que han sido muy reprimidas y que no se atreven a decir nada porque s muchas cosas tan crueles que me llegan a enfermar el pueblo mapuche ha sido humillado ha sido perseguido he visto tanta gente aplastada emocionalmente siqui tricamente tanta gente que no se atreve a hablar por eso estoy presa
261307 los ni os enfermos de temucuicui comunidad mapuche de la zona de ercilla sometida a constantes allanamientos de las fuerzas especiales de carabineros se ve en sus dibujos en sus dibujos ellos pintan militares dentro de sus casas explosiones de bombas lacrim genas eso es lo que no quieren que se sepa y quieren saber adem s d nde est n los mapuches que est n luchando para exterminarlos como quieren hacer conmigo yo quise hacer una pel cula y me encarcelaron esta es una manera de exterminarme de silenciarme
261308 las autoridades la han detenido en un intento de frenar las investigaciones sobre este conflicto y de intimidar tanto a ella como al pueblo ind gena mapuche la polic a confisc en su casa art culos como cintas de v deo equipo de sonido c maras fotogr ficas y tel fonos m viles as como vestuario que se necesita para filmar el documental adem s se llev los materiales de la investigaci n que elena varela hab a realizado y documentos relacionados con la financiaci n de la pel cula por parte del fondo de fomento audiovisual del consejo nacional de la cultura y las artes amnist a internacional teme que esta informaci n pueda ser utilizada por las fuerzas de seguridad chilenas para intimidar y acosar a activistas mapuches y a quienes contribuyen con su opini n a la investigaci n
261309 dos periodistas franceses christopher cyril harrison y joffrey paul rossj fueron detenidos el 17 de marzo pasado en collipulli mientras filmaban a un werk n autoridad tradicional del pueblo mapuche la polic a requis los equipos de filmaci n as como las cintas que conten an el trabajo realizado hasta ese momento aunque hubo un intento de expulsi n el c nsul franc s evit que eso ocurriera dos d as despu s fueron agredidos en la calle junto al werk n por un grupo de doce personas algo similar ocurri el s bado 3 de mayo con giuseppe gabriele y dario ioseffi dos documentalistas italianos en momentos en que hac an un registro audiovisual de una movilizaci n mapuche en un predio de forestal mininco reivindicado hace casi dos d cadas por la comunidad chupilko
261310 preocupaci n por la situaci n de la libertad de expresi n en chile
261311 por no poder mostrar lo que ten a para mostrar pero tengo que ser fuerte porque el dolor de los mapuches lo estoy sufriendo ahora yo en carne propia
261312 documentalista de film mapuche y las graves violaciones al trabajo documental
261313 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
261314 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
261315 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
261316 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
261317 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
261318 tengo la sensaci n de haber hecho todo lo posible y haberlo hecho bien en el fallo el tribunal le dio validez a la presunci n de inocencia que en los casos mapuches ha sido muy pocas veces respetada y ahora espero que ese fallo sea respetado
261319 the governor did an end run around the labor process and the government code
261320 its not simply flipping a switch and all of the salaries of identified employees go to 1 100 a month
261321 the state constitution and a supreme court decision clearly support the governors action
261322 he is prepared to defend this in court if necessary to protect the states ability to meet its obligations
261323 now i cant pay my mortgage i cant pay anything lights gas food so i guess im going on a diet

261326 in til buscar un programa de recuperaci n que sea consistente con el pago de la deuda fijada por nuestros acreedores
261327 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
261328 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
261329 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
261330 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
261331 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar
261332 el sector paraestatal continuar a siendo un riesgo para la exitosa implementaci n del presupuesto de 2002 03 las intervenciones del gobierno en la agricultura y otros mercados alimentarios est n socavando otras inversiones m s productivas

261336 insultar golpear y en ltimo caso humillar de la forma en la que se le hizo y no conformes con ello con el objetivo de eludir su responsabilidad en los acontecimientos se le acusa y se le imponen cargos sin fundamentos s lidos que son requerimiento esencial en este tipo de casos
261337 junto con lo mencionado previamente es menester mencionar y explicitar el hecho que el acusado est siendo procesado por el mismo tribunal militar regional que dej impune a los asesinos de los hermanos alex lemun y mat as katrileo por lo cual es clara la tendencia del tribunal en cuesti n
261338 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile

261341 emplazamos p blicamente a ambos consejeros a que si tienen algo que decir comentar o discutir las puertas de la comunidad siempre han estado abiertas al di logo y por lo tanto les invitamos p blicamente a visitarnos adem s necesitamos que cambien su actitud servil a los intereses del estado chileno y que le hacen un flaco favor a la lucha de nuestro pueblo mapuche
261342 todav a no se ha hecho la devoluci n pedida de las cintas y del respeto al derecho del secreto de las fuentes eso independiente que la ley no lo consigne porque esto no significa que no sea leg timo se ha pedido al ministerio de interior por medio de su subsecretario felipe harboe y a trav s de la ministra de cultura paulina urrutia pero la verdad estamos a la espera de una conferencia de prensa del ministerio de cultura la que todav a no se da

261350 los colonos pasaban a ser como due os ilegales los ruiz los castillo los acu a por eso decidimos entrar con nuestras familias pero apenas entramos ellos hicieron las denuncias por robo de animales por da os por usurpaci n de tierras f jese si la tierra habia sido de nuestros abuelos veranadas que ten amos y nos acusaban de estar usurpando no nos movilizamos solos tambien de malla malla de cau ic la gente comenz a moverse para recuperar su tierra es por esta raz n que me persiguen judicialmente

261402 as part of our annual august model year clearance we are leveraging the move from leasing to retail purchases to offer our customers the best deals of the year and make buying as affordable as renting
261403 we have re packaged our incentive spending typically spent on leasing into retail purchase packages to lower monthly payments on select vehicles from the dodge caliber and dodge charger to the chrysler town amp country and jeep liberty with the model year ending on 2008 vehicles the time to buy has never been better

261407 there are many changes taking place that give us at the new chrysler cause for optimism in the short term our 2009 model year vehicles with value packages will soon be arriving in dealerships and our august incentive packages are the best deals of the year helping to make owning as affordable as leasing within the product lineup our leadership in minivans is well timed as consumers look for fuel efficient alternatives to larger suvs two new fuel saving hybrid suvs the dodge durango and chrysler aspen will soon be hitting the streets the dodge journey and jeep patriot are gaining more customers on the appeal of fuel efficiency and affordability and the success of cars like the dodge avenger charger and challenger shows that customers still want their cars to stand out from the crowd lastly this fall we come to market with our best new pickup truck ever the 2009 dodge ram

261496 right now we are designing a prosthetic leg for cassidy that will have sensors in it to measure the force
261497 i just knew deep down that i was saving a life when i took him
261498 we let the bone rest and merge with the implant for the three month period or so it takes for that implant to be firmly anchored
261499 as we gain more experience with the surgical technique and the design of the limbs we see the possible benefits for humans implants that allow the prosthetic limbs to attach without chafing or irritation and limbs with more natural ranges of motion

261512 but ultimately were going to have to grow the business in a tough market
261513 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations

261531 four hamas militants including mohammed ghazal a member of the hamas leadership in the west bank have been released on abbass orders
261532 it is insufficient because around 200 hamas members have been arrested in the past few days and we expect these political prisoners to be released

261601 friday afternoon we completed the on scene examination weve collected some exhibits they will be sent off to the lab they will take some time to get back several weeks maybe even a month
261602 we will be reviewing the photographs from the scene along with the evidence statements by witnesses on the scene well probably be having a preliminary report mid to late next week but we wont have a final report until we have the lab results back
261603 the city is certainly pleased also to announced that next year we will be offering 15 thousand dollars in each of two categories
261604 they kind of raced one day and the whole team was egging them on
261605 they took off and jahvid was right behind desean and looking at him then jahvid went past him a bit and then out of respect he kind of pulled off a little bit and desean went ahead but i think thats just because jahvids a nice guy
261606 after the way washington and stanford happened it was evident that we all needed to come together and look at accountability issues

261626 es geht uns darum vor allem jugendliche aufwachen zu lassen
261627 sie sind ja meist erst indirekt von der arbeitslosigkeit ihrer eltern betroffen wir wollen dass sie eigene protestaktionen gegen arbeitslosigkeit starten
261628 vergangenes jahr war der arbeitsplatz meines vaters bei bayer bedroht
261629 ich konnte deshalb nicht mit meiner familie in den urlaub fahren stattdessen waren wir dann auf unserer protestfahrt unterwegs
261630 aber es gab niemanden mit einer eigenen aktion deswegen fahren wir jetzt wieder
261631 aber ich will nicht schlappmachen denn ich will ein symbol sein f r das durchhalten im kampf um arbeitspl tze

261634 all my life my family has been in the business since the30s my father t g solomon started with gulf states he was considered a pioneer in the drive in business in the late 40s and 50s

261637 several reopening an old theater in downtown bogalusa in louisiana in 1973 opening a new twin in that town in 1974 i suppose selling in 1986 to united artists selling in 2002 to amc
261638 we dont have a lot of competition were generally far enough away from others even in the same city that we dont really need to worry about that
261639 we try to sell at a lower price than the national average we pride our theaters on being maintained cleaner and well kept
261640 the closer we got to election day the more opportunities developed sometimes as you get closer some fall off the list the last time we went through this in 2006 the closer we got to voting day the more competitive
261641 the short answer is that were very impressed with what theyve done and we see that campaign on an upward trajectory
261642 its always hard to do the monday morning quarterbacking so what weve done this year is just focus on this cycle and weve identified this race very early as one we thought we could win which is why we began to run our radio ads in these districts even before the incumbent decided to retire
261643 i dont think that kind of tactic is going to work
261644 i think it will simply highlight the fact that he has been unable to attract much financial support
261645 i think that the two republican candidates in the two districts are working hard and running good competitive campaigns
261646 the democrats are running with a very heavy load on their backs from their low approval ratings and they left town today without doing one thing to lower energy prices i think that will have a drag effect for some of these democrats running for congressional seats

261651 refuse any gifts or take home packets distributed by the maternal health care facility that contain commercial advertising or product samples
261652 codifies mothers rights to breastfeed into a single concise document and bans commercial interests from influencing new mothers choice of breastfeeding
261653 has kept the breastfeeding bill of rights bottled up in committee for too long
261654 it s a fine idea but the implementation is something you have to be very cautious about
261655 i think we should leave the practice of medicine to people who are licensed to do that
261656 we need to be worthy of the vocation that we have which is belonging to the catholic church to those to whom much is given much is expected
261657 be the wheat in a field of wheat and weeds
261658 thats what i hope you do here at the defending the faith conference defend it against distortion and misunderstanding and show people the truth
261659 atheism isnt really a new trend we see forms of atheism throughout history whats new is that they are no longer very polite they are agitated and militant
261660 its important to defend the faith against them because they have no qualms at all about attacking the faith you dont want to leave the realm of reason and philosophy open because thats what richard dawkins and his friends are trying to undermine usually we have to defend the dogmatic realm of faith but we also have to defend the reasoning of faith and philosophy as well
261661 as you find out reading his material chance for dawkins is a kind of miraculous power and he uses it to destroy the faith that is to destroy the belief in god
261662 then you are swallowing a very unhealthy dose of rhetorical swindling and error
261663 the media makes a very big issue on this as it looks to them like a major injustice that women are being excluded
261664 in the catholic church we believe that christ himself instituted a ministry that would carry forward his own teaching through the ages through the sacramentality of men who would represent him as bishops and priests
261665 theres a distinction between the catholic understanding of the priesthood and the protestant understanding of the ordained ministry many people have lost sight of it
261666 its not a power struggle between men and women its that some men have been chosen for an office in which they act not by reason of their own holiness of competence but because of the sacramental consecration that christ entrusts to them
261667 this has been the norm and when anyone departed from the norm even in the second and third centuries they were denounced immediately as unfaithful
261668 courage to stand and tell people to follow god this is something that we must do as well
261669 has anyone seen cnn lately paul says that it is not through rhetoric that the truth can be found but through the wisdom of the cross

261679 ive felt like ive not been contributing and letting the team down so today was very special
261680 its a day i will never forget because its been hard in the last few months
261681 professional sport is a difficult industry and when you havent scored runs you feel pressure
261682 having scored the number of runs i have so far this year in test cricket of course i felt a lot of pressure
261683 you try to keep believing thankfully it came around today for me
261684 michael vaughan said to me just go out there and be positive be the aggressor and it stood me in good stead
261685 the boys have been fantastic they all know its been tough for me over the last few months but the support you get in the dressing room is superb a lot of people dont know what its like
261686 everybody realised how difficult it has been over the past few months and they have said a score has just been around the corner and today proved that
261687 i havent read the papers for some time but you always tend to find out
261688 i have a friend i like like that and i don
261689 my claim to fame is ive done the rough water international championships in california for 18 years in a row and thats 10 miles and thats the longest ive ever done at a time
261690 when i lost my leg a lot of doors were closed but a lot opened
261691 i still do anything i still snow ski and i dont have to wait in the lift lines because they just let me cut through you have to look for the positives in life
261692 when we take the boat across from the start its really depressing because its like we have to swim back this far
261693 one of our primary goals in developing a campaign is to match the marketing to the personality of the individual show so 90210 will have its own unique look and feel as does gossip girl and privileged and top model
261694 for the 90210 campaign were using a lot of vibrant colors and natural sunlight to give it a southern california appeal to communicate a fun inviting atmosphere that will appeal to our target audience
261695 he did it flawlessly starting out with a teen audience and making the transition

261697 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
261698 right now we are designing a prosthetic leg for cassidy that will have sensors in it to measure the force
261699 i just knew deep down that i was saving a life when i took him
261700 we let the bone rest and merge with the implant for the three month period or so it takes for that implant to be firmly anchored
261701 as we gain more experience with the surgical technique and the design of the limbs we see the possible benefits for humans implants that allow the prosthetic limbs to attach without chafing or irritation and limbs with more natural ranges of motion
261702 on a regular basis we see this process becoming even faster and more cost effective in the future
261703 be able to receive a ct scan from a hospital and probably within days turn this around
261704 it would of course be impractical to suggest living in a less hygienic environment or changing living conditions in order to afford possible protection from future development of ibd
261705 for men its less of a shortfall when they are older because thats when they tend to be married and when women have already experienced things like divorce and widowhood
261706 usually people who are married have a better financial situation since often they have double incomes
261707 they also are more likely to fulfill their financial aspirations
261708 in economic theory one of the assumptions is that preferences are stable so you basically dont change your wants but we see the wants do change that people really adapt to achievement
261709 so when they attain goods then they want more goods
261710 what that means for happiness is quite interesting it means that when you acquire something in the material goods domain it will not really increase your happiness because you just adjust your aspirations
261711 if hes not very good with ball security then he wont play tailback at florida
261712 hes got talent but theres no chance youll see him play regardless of whatever dot com says and all the e mail ill get and everything else he will not play football if theres a chance its falling on the ground
261713 if chris rainey was 215 pounds and kestahn moore ran 10 4 100 meters put those two together and youre good
261714 our staff has done a great job staying one step ahead adding a fullback going no huddle adding a formation with two tight ends
261715 there might be a possibility hell be starting in that first game
261716 i thought it was as good as theyve played all spring
261717 i think i am more motivated than in the past
261718 not even just because of the national championship hopes or anything like that i just know what kind of talent we have i know what kind of hard work it takes
261719 im certainly disappointed in a few of our players who have made poor decisions during the offseason it is of great concern and we take it very seriously they will be dealt with accordingly and will pay a price each one will be disciplined based on the severity of their actions
261720 the good news is that i think they both did some really good things and i feel very confident that our offense is not going to fall off the face of the earth with either one of them at quarterback
261721 i am pleased with the level of play from both of them
261722 to me it is always better to have two good quarterbacks and i think that is where we are i feel a lot better about this position at the end of spring practice then i did at the start
261723 we need to get a lot better at that we have been very good at the past couple years is the vertical passing game
261724 we had a few wide open people that we missed and honestly we didnt work on that as much this spring and it will be a point of emphasis going into fall camp we will be working on giving receivers a chance to make a play and getting the ball to them when they are open even when they are tightly covered
261725 this is clearly the best pass coverage that we have had in the spring since i have been here
261726 we have more talent and more depth in the secondary than we have ever had it is obvious in the passes that were caught and in the passes that were dropped that the coverage was there for the most part and very aggressive
261727 anything can happen well see how they work this summer is very important for these guys but coach steve spurrier wanted to name a no 1 guy and tommy beecher earned it
261728 id like to have about 30 more days of spring practice
261729 i think it signifies our belief in them in what theyve accomplished and what we think they will accomplish i think it signifies their value to the university of tennessee
261730 we didnt get a chance to play some guys because of injuries and couldnt substitute as much as wed like but i thought the kids overall attitude was really good
261731 were not at the point of saying who will start at some positions but its not for a lack of competition
261732 our goal was to get every player to improve as we can have more guys play to their potential
261733 we wanted to improve relative to effort togetherness and responsibility and we made a lot of progress in those areas
261734 our second goal was to make some decisions about what our strengths are and what our needs are for the future
261735 weve made some progress in that area it starts with everybody understanding what the expectation is as far as representing this institution and understanding why that is important
261736 were seeing more players starting to affect other players were seeing that peer pressure can work in some cases and that does have an effect
261737 weve got some young guys coming in with ability my role will be to establish a time when i can tell them what to do because i already understand the defense ive already talked to a lot of the recruits i think they are humble and understand what their role will be but they are ready to go were going to do something good the way the season ended last year well now a lot of guys saw what coach nick saban had been telling us about finishing strong
261738 we certainly have a long way to go weve got a lot of new faces in there i feel good about our front on both sides offense and defense
261739 hes had a good spring ive been impressed with his spring hes worked hard at really understanding the offense i think hes worked just as hard at trying to understand defenses and what coverages are doing now hes starting to put the two together
261740 this group has a great opportunity but it all depends on the next few months
261741 how hard do they want to work to get to atlanta and win in atlanta for the sec championship game theres a lot of other teams out there with a lot of talent
261742 this could be a good group if they come together continue to get better do all their work in the offseason come back and have a positive two a days
261743 everybody has the same type of athletes everybody has good players everybody works hard and everybody is well coached
261744 its just a matter of are we going to be special are we going to go the extra mile are we going to be unselfish and pass up personal things for the team thats how you win a championship
261745 i think this defense is more athletic than any defense i was associated with at pittsburgh
261746 without a doubt theres enough talent here to win a lot of football games
261747 in this new offense we are running he uses his athletic ability the problem he was having was throwing the ball well consistently he has a great work ethic his high school coaches did a good job hes really gotten better i dont know if hes going to be the starter but hes going to play a lot its going to be a battle i like his leadership hes been here a year but it seems like a lot longer hes been a big part of our team so far and hes going to be a huge part of it the next few years
261748 the 2007 team was the national champion no question we want to compete and see how good we can be in 2008 the experience we have will certainly benefit them they understand how hard they have to work that everyone will be playing their best against us as they have for several years the motivation should be a healthy one
261749 if i could do it all over id change a lot of things i did
261750 i watched to see how the young guys would progress in the spring and i think they progressed extremely well both lee and hatch will play a lot of football at quarterback and have really improved i like the two guys that i had in spring
261751 change is hard for some its something new whether it is a new coach a new system or the new terminology
261752 we had to change their attitude and to me that is changing the little things it is about winning in everything you do some of the guys are used to losing on the field and in life and i want to change that going to class sitting up in your seat being on time
261753 all he needs is repetitions and game time he has a quick release and throws a pretty ball this is a guy where everything is in front of him
261754 jevans had an excellent spring i love his way of standing in that pocket he has a quick release and he doesnt flinch he doesnt care if someones coming full speed he knows hes going to take a shot for the team theres a lot of quarterbacks that will turn and run and hide but he doesnt he sits in there strong with confidence and finds our receiver he gives us a chance offensively to keep people off balance
261755 we have worked extremely hard on our play action passing game and throwing the ball up the field we intend to throw the ball down the field this year
261756 i think with our receivers were capable of throwing the ball up the field more
261757 i feel were good with wes carroll at quarterback wes got a lot of snaps for us last year but the big question mark was who the backup was going to be i think this spring and today tyson lee showed us what he can do i mean he can make a lot of things happen especially getting outside of the pocket keeping the play alive being a mobile type guy so i think weve got a good nucleus to start to start off with coming back weve got a lot of work to do over the summer with quarterbacks and centers making sure we get a good clean exchange and all those guys working together especially in the passing game this summer when they start doing the seven on seven against the defense i feel well make a lot of progress there
261758 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
261759 while we were watching he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stared at us and dropped the head right in front of us
261760 there was no rage in him and he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
261761 he was taunting police with the head in his hand out the window
261762 at this time im not aware of what may have provoked this attack
261763 i can confirm the victim was stabbed and that the victim was pronounced dead at the scene
261764 this is one of the most horrific crimes i have ever heard in my life
261765 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
261766 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues
261767 i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues
261768 it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world
261769 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
261770 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations
261771 we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
261772 we are less concerned with their public comments than we are with actions on the ground in china
261773 we would like to see an improvement in human rights freedom and democracy in their country and they know where the president stands
261774 your wow score would be just one factor that will go into your blizzard level and rather than call it a score we just wanted it to be like youre leveling up on blizzard games youll have this blizzard identity and youll be able to see things like oh this guy was great at diablo iii but he never played starcraft and he was mediocre in wow that sort of thing

261790 everywhere there are people carrying burdens cultivating gardens preparing meals striking a bargain for some goods from far away conducting ceremonial dances playing games with either sacred or gambling intent or both and in short living their daily lives in the metropolis
261791 i am thanking you for doing your part in helping to save these people it will always be remembered this you have done the time will come when another world will be destroyed and when wicked people know their last day on earth has come they will sit by an anthill and cry for the ants to save them now having fulfilled your duty you may go forth to this second world i have created and take your place as ants
261792 make your emergence now to this second world i have created it is not quite so beautiful as the first world but it is beautiful just the same you will like it so multiply and be happy but remember your creator and the laws he gave you when i hear you singing joyful praises to him i will know you are my children and you will be close to me in your hearts

261795 frankly there was a lot of dispute at the time it was granted to them
261796 circumstances have changed with oil at these levels we dont think that manufacturers credit is necessary to encourage them to explore and produce oil and gas
261797 it is the responsibility of the people to vote the congress out of office for good we need action not talk
261798 we are giving our wealth to the middle east because we refuse to provide our own energy why because our congress represents the corporate state and not the people
261799 in fact every new promise that the new members of congress ran on to get elected remains exactly that an empty promise i have to laugh when i recall the self righteous finger waving of house speaker nancy pelosi and company now go on and enjoy your vacation you earned it
261800 we have all been wringing our hands about energy and our dependence on foreign oil for the past 30 years
261801 and we wonder why the public is cynical and the wrong track numbers are at an all time high
261802 members of congress and in this example i mean the majority have refused to take any action because it is easier to wait out the presidential election and then see what the climate is like because unfortunately for the people congress can choose to vote only when it is convenient to do so
261803 because there is nothing they can do for immediate energy prices and they have profound differences for the long term that are not easily reconcilable
261804 right now the publics anger at washington is mainly being taken out on the party of the president
261805 and its not likely that is going in change due to congresss failure to act during the august recess
261806 allowing offshore drilling will have no impact on gas prices its a drop in the bucket
261807 but the idea that this is a conspiracy by the big oil companies is wrong as well
261808 even though our initial plan does not entail a re zoning of the site from industrial we feel it would be foolish not to explore other uses based upon having a commuter rail stop down the street
261809 references made to blueprint denvers plans for the site to remain an industrial area of stability are irrelevant since the report was published two years before fastracks was even approved by voters
261810 it is clear based on changes since the inception of blueprint denver that the document is descriptive and not prescriptive
261811 we couldnt be happier with the results the addition of trym s legendary drumming and the experience on the production mixing end that james brought to us has been priceless this album wholly eclipses everything weve recorded in the past and we cant wait to begin playing the new material live

261827 its sort of the olympic scoring system eliminate the best and the worst and hopefully you get a median on how things are on average
261828 considering how the economy is doing earnings arent falling off the table

261838 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him

261850 one day while i was still young i entertained committing a sin with another youth whose habit it was to fall to his desires and as soon as the notion came to me my whole body broke out in blisters i quickly begged gods forgiveness and the blisters vanished as quickly as they had appeared by the grace of god and his blessing
261851 i used to spend time in the shrine of moulay idris the second
261852 what is the matter why is it i see you in such as state
261853 dont you worry i will point you the way to him as long as you dont consult the people who are short of insight and lacking in intellect
261854 he is the most noble master and descendent of the prophet allah bless him and give him peace he is the succour of our time and the vast ocean abu al hasan ali b
261855 it was my practice never to approach an action until i consulted god through the well known prayer of the prophet allah bless him and give him peace istikh ra
261856 one of the first lessons i learnt from my teacher was when he placed two baskets full of berries in my hands he did not place them on my shoulders like my peers even so it bore down so heavy on my ego that i felt intensely constricted deep inside i was so disturbed shaken and felt so indecent that i became to weep i swear to god i wept out of the humiliation abasement and utter wretchedness of the situation as my ego could not bear to take such a lesson it would not bow down to the test ever in a thousand years i was so oblivious of my own arrogance haughtiness malignancy and stubbornness and i had previously had no idea whether it was arrogant or not i had never learnt this lesson from any teacher of law throughout all my previous studies and i had studied with many a teacher whilst in this state my teacher saw what had come over me because of his deep insight into the hidden secrets for which he was well known to all he came over took the baskets and placed them right on top of my shoulders just like my peers who were so much more righteous and advanced on the path than me then he said this is for your own good in order to chase away some of that arrogance of yours instantly a door of understanding opened for me and things became clear i was now able to distinguish the truth in everything i could discern the arrogant from the humble the serious from the lax those of knowledge from amongst those of ignorance those who follow the way of the prophet peace be upon him from the people of innovation and those who practice what they preach from those who do not no one was able to get the better of me after this event because my teacher had taught me how to distinguish truth from falsehood may god reward him and protect him amin
261857 we believe and god knows best that the state of annihilation can be achieved in a short space of time god willing by invoking gods majestic name allah in a specific manner
261858 the method is to picture the five letters of the name when reciting it
261859 i immediately turned my thoughts away from it back to the invoking of the name as i had done so to many other notions that had come to me
261860 from that point i realised that there was nothing present but god alone and there is nothing in the creation but him thanks and praise be to him
261861 after i had become firm and sure in the path and i had attained a clear opening and my master wanted me to benefit others he told me to go back to my homeland with my family and children
261862 i visited him on seven different occasions whilst i was still a youth on one visit i found him surrounded by a huge group of people yet he moved the people aside for me and ushered me forward i kissed his hand and knee and proceeded to place two tablets of quran in his lap on one of them was sura he took hold of it and read a section of it silently whilst pressing his palm upon my forehead he was overjoyed at my being there and he prayed that god grant me much good after that visit much good and blessing came to me i was able to memorise much after being very weak at retaining information i consider him one of my teachers
261863 i met with him seven times in ban zarw l and once or twice in fez also
261864 off you go we have given you the highest of stations
261865 go i have given you all that is in the east and west i left the gathering and when i came back i found that he had passed away he is buried in the z wiyah of his uncle s d muhammad al h jj al baqq li in fez
261866 if you want to visit the people of the path of fez then start with ibn al arab al ma raf then al b hirzihim abd all h at touwdi yusuf al f si muhammad b abdull h ahmad al yamani al al jamal abu al b ytousi abu yaza in t ghya abu silh m on the coast close to umm ar rab abdull h b ahmad in meknes abu zakariya of meknes moulay abd as sal m abu yaz d the shaykh of abu madyan in maziyy t and finally abu madyan in tlemcan
261867 whoever makes his ablution before making sure all the drops of urine have gone does not have any ablution prayer or religion for that matter
261868 sitting on the earth without a rug brings about enrichment
261869 o god you are peace from you ensues peace and to you returns peace bring us alive though peace and enter us into the abode of peace you are most blessed and you are most high o one of majesty and generosity there is no god but god he is alone he has no partner to him belongs the dominion and to him belongs all praise he is upon all things able o god there is no one to hold back what you grant and there is no one to grant what you hold back and no one can repel what you have already ordained and might can benefit him against you
261870 after reading the wadh fa in a circle the shaykh or muqaddam who has the permission of the shaykh initiates the invocation of unity l ill ha illall h
261871 i saw a group of people who told us of the descent of jesus peace be upon him and they said that he had already descended and that he will have in his hand a wooden sword with which he struck stones and they became men and when he struck animals they became human now i was conscious in my vision that i knew the man who had descended from heaven that he had written letters to me and i to him then i made ready to meet him and when i reached him i found that he was shaikh s d ahmed al alaw but in the guise of a doctor tending the sick and with him were more than sixty men to help him may god be pleased with him
261872 what i saw in the shaykh and his disciples compelled me to cleave to his presence and in the longing for a possible means of opening my inward eye i asked him permission to invoke the supreme name until then i had simply been an initiate of the order and nothing more but i had heard that my ancestors used to rely on the order as a means of direct attainment not merely of attachment to a spiritual chain after i had practised the invocation of the name according to his instructions i had certain experiences which compelled me to persevere in it and before long had direct knowledge of god if i served the shaykh as a slave for ever and ever i should not have given him back a tenth of what i owe him in a word it was what compelled my great grandfather to follow s d moulay al al jamal which compelled me to follow shaikh s d ahmed al alaw i paid no attention to those of my family who blamed me for following him for they did not know the truth of the matter but when i explained things to my uncle s d moulay abd al rahm n he showed no opposition to my following the shaykh on the contrary he often gave me to understand that he had no objection
261873 when he was around twenty eight years of age in the year 1315 he travelled with some local fuqar to visit the sheikh of the darq wi order in bou bar h sheikh abd al rahm n who was the grandson of moulay al arab al darq wi he was the youngest of the travellers but when he arrived at the sheikhs home the sheikh cried welcome my beloved welcome my beloved he sat him at his side and he was given the litany of the order he visited his sheikh 25 times in his life when setting off to visit he would gather the fuqar and travel as a group on foot from n dur to ban zarw l singing out odes on the road ahead they would rest from village to village until they arrived at the z wiyah of the sheikh his sheikh always sang his praises he used to call him the stallion of the order one day he was sitting by the side of moulay abd al rahm n in a gathering with the fuqar when the sheikh put his hand on moulay sulaim ns back he called out this is the stallion of this order everyone repeat after me by god this is the stallion of the order so they repeated the words of their sheikh one day he was with his sheikh and he said to him this order holds direct knowledge of god and i want a portion of that knowledge the sheikh replied to him invoke god until the knowledge comes to you from those words moulay sulaim n knew that the future would hold great things for him he was highly respected in the order and all the brethren loved him and honoured him after the death of moulay abd al rahm n moulay sulaim n travelled to take from sheikh al alaw he came to know of sheikh al alaw through his friend s d muhamm d bil h jj
261874 whilst in this dilemma he dreamt one night that his sheikh moulay abd al rahm n visited him saying give me my letter that you have moulay sulaim n took out the letter and gave it to him the sheikh then signed it with his signature and returned it to him when he awoke he interpreted that it meant he had permission to visit sheikh al alaw and join his order
261875 verily he who hath made the quran binding upon thee will bring thee home once more
261876 then you have no path coming together is necessary even if it is just once in a week
261877 if you found paradise opened up before you and the fuq ra were besides its door invoking god which one would you choose would you sit with the fuq ra or enter the door into paradise
261878 nay i would choose to sit with the fuq ra their company is the gardens of paradise
261879 o sir i am apologise i am just imparting some words to these brothers
261880 your knowledge is dry they will not accept it nor digest it
261881 my brothers the state of someone suffices one from needing to ask about them if again you see a scholar like this one clean shaven and dressed in western attire then take him and his knowledge and throw it to the waves
261882 women have many chores in the day such as having to educate the children clean the house and so forth therefore it is enough that she read ten of each invocation instead of the prescribed one hundred
261883 if one intends to teach others how to recite the litany then it is preferable do so in group otherwise it is better to recite it individually
261884 i used to know a sheikh called s d hamu of the family of the prophet he left his home and went for several years to morocco and when he returned many people attached themselves to him he used to speak with authority about the path of the mystics but to try him god sent against him a man who did him much harm so that he found himself faced with all sorts of opposition and now he is as subdued as any disciple without a trace of his former spiritual activity however i think that he is one who could be relied on for guidance upon the path no true spiritual guide has ever appeared whom god did not try with someone who wronged him either openly or behind his back
261885 his talk is far above what one finds in books
261886 can you bring me one now and charm it here in front of us
261887 i will show you one that is bigger than this and far more venomous and if you can take hold of it you are a real sage
261888 i mean your soul which is between the two sides of your body its poison is more deadly than a snakes and if you can take hold of it and do what you please with it you are as i have said a sage indeed
261889 go and do with that little snake whatever you usually do with them and never go back to such practices again
261890 if you live long enough you will be god willing like sheikh s d muhammad ibn is
261891 there is no place better for being alone than the cemetery
261892 i did not give you a binding order i merely said there was no place better for being alone than the cemetery
261893 they are on the doctrine of unity at tawh d and i am now at the realization of proofs
261894 s d so and so used to call it the doctrine of turbidity at tawh l
261895 you had better busy yourself now with purifying your innermost soul until the light of your lord dawns in it and you come to know the real meaning of unity but as for scholastic theology it will only serve to increase your doubts and pile up illusion upon illusion
261896 you had better leave the rest of those lessons until you are through with your present task for it is an obligation to put what is more important before what is of lesser importance
261897 i am he whom i love and he whom i love is i
261898 take them out of your mind and put them in a book and then they will let you rest
261899 now you must speak and guide men to this path inasmuch as you are now certain where you stand
261900 you will be like a lion whatever you put your hand on you will take hold of it
261901 it was through his blessing and with his permission that i went to morocco
261902 go to morocco i have smoothed out the way for thee
261903 but morocco is full of poisonous snakes i cannot live there
261904 go and fear not i will protect thee from any mishap that might befall thee
261905 when i returned from morocco i taught our doctrine as i had taught it there
261906 s d act on our behalf and take care of our interests in the next world before god and i will act on your behalf in this world and take care of s d mustafa
261907 it is for you to appoint whom you wish for this function and i will support you
261908 we had better leave this question for the moment and meet again next week in the meantime if any of the fuq ra has a vision let him tell us about it
261909 s d to whom have you left the fuq ra
261910 it was i who planted the shoot but it is s d ahmad bin al wah who will tend it and it will come god willing to all fullness of fruition at his hands
261911 in this water which is left over from the sheikh there is a cure for all sickness

261926 thou hast attained unto that which is attained to by the perfect among men
261927 i have made thee the instrument of my credit with god and a link between me and his prophet
261928 during that time i met with the perfect sheikh the gnostic s d ahmad ibn idr s i found him on a most exalted footing as regards following the wont of the prophet and i so marvelled at his state that i took initiation from him for the blessing of it
261929 i quivered and shook at the sweetness of that utterance and i understood it to be an authorization from the apostle of the all bountiful king
261930 and just now while i was looking at you as i have been for some time i suddenly realized that you must be that very man
261931 i am the only man of this art in all of erba
261932 here is the sheikh himself at the door asking if he can come in

261952 many people have argued that having a legitimate hypervisor installed prevents installation of virtualization based malware we will show that this is not the case
261953 years ago other vendors tried to downplay the importance of microsoft windows kernel rootkits saying that one needed to already be an administrator in order to install one as we know over the last couple of years kernel rootkits became a very serious security problem
261954 it is automatically created when the system boots and does a lot of the management of the system it builds all of the other user domains and manages all of their virtual devices
261955 the subverting techniques we will be presenting at black hat indeed assume that the attacker first obtained access to domain 0
261956 domain 0 being an administrative domain requires certain services to be run inside it one such service is an secure shell daemon this makes the attack surface on domain 0 quite large
261957 over the last year it has been shown that domain 0 is far from being bulletproof with our presentations we take the game to the new level by studying how to compromise the hypervisor and what we can do to prevent it
261958 we will show how to bypass those protections and subvert xen hypervisor memory

261979 il fait pr sumer que cette personne a recouvr compl tement son int grit morale
261980 la ligne de force de ce jugement est de renforcer la valeur du pardon en disant quun pardon il faut que cela veuille dire quelque chose cela instaure une pr somption que la r habilitation dune personne a restaur son int grit morale
261981 la cour supr me dit que cest le fardeau de lemployeur donc de la police de mener une enqu te suffisamment rigoureuse de se constuituer un dossier et de faire une analyse personnalis e de la situation pour d cider si cette personne nest pas de bonnes moeurs la cour reconna t que le pardon nefface pas le pass et que lemployeur peut quand m me regarder les circonstances de linfraction mais quil ne peut pas arr ter son analyse en disant quil nembauche pas une personne parce quelle a t d clar e coupable dune infraction

261983 ll faut faire son chemin cest ce quil faut faire pour entrer une fois que tu es dedans a va je ne pense pas que les kyle busch jeff gordon et jimmie johnson doivent trouver des commanditaires a soulign villeneuve lors dun point de presse vendredi mais cest comme a il y a beaucoup de pilotes qui sont habiles qui veulent courir qui sont issus de courses am ricaines
261984 les jeunes am ricains se retrouvent sur terre battue l ge de six ans puis ils gravissent les chelons et se retrouvent vite l chelle nationale ce qui fait que rendu 17 ans ils sont de vraies fus es cest donc tr s comp titif et cest ce qui explique quil y ait moins de places pour les canadiens en nascar a expliqu carpentier vendredi au canada on conduit des moto neiges en hiver
261985 cest plus une question de montrer quel point jai envie de faire ce m tier l les quipes de nascar ne veulent pas dun pique assiette
261986 un bon r sultat aiderait du c t des commanditaires mais a naurait aucun effet sur les quipes parce que la course de samedi sera disput e sur circuit routier a d clar villeneuve ce qui importe aux quipes cest ce quon peut faire sur les ovales
261987 ca peut toujours aider si tu domines tout le week end a dit carpentier qui avait justement fait cela lann e pass e en obtenant des bons r sultats aux essais en d crochant la position de t te en qualifications puis en terminant deuxi me dans la course
261988 mais en m me temps cest plus dificile maintenant que a l tait je ne pense pas quon va voir autant de pilotes issus des circuits de monoplaces samener en nascar chaque ann e comme a t le cas cette ann e
261989 ils ont tent lexp rience avec plusieurs pilotes cette ann e mais la moiti dentre eux ne sont d j plus l

262008 if they are sufficiently complete to live they do live and it is well they should live if they are not sufficiently complete to live they die and it is best they should die
262009 of course in so far as the severity of this process is mitigated by the spontaneous sympathy of men for each other it is proper that it should be mitigated
262010 the upshot of the entire section then is that while the operation of natural selection is beneficial its mitigation by human benevolence is even more beneficial

262067 crossing the public mood on energy prices could be risky
262068 what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
262069 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
262070 but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years
262071 the issues that people care about have changed dramatically since 2006 here and not incidentally in a way that is beneficial to republican candidates
262072 is engaged to carolyn murphy theyve been together for over a year
262073 it was really cute first heather proposed to carolyn then carolyn proposed to her
262074 we were sitting in my pink room with pink carpeting

262076 with this funding we will support treatment for at least 3 million people
262077 was accurate voluntary and intelligent and supported by the evidence
262078 i would take his call now i will take his call when hes president any time remember no matter who is president i dont see this as a political thing i see this as we always have to help no matter what the administration is
262079 if obama is running around talking about change maybe this is the year of change
262080 this is our opportunity lets take the word change yes lets change the system in california because there needs to be change
262081 hes never been afraid to throw nominees under the bus
262082 in his own election in 06 you know he abandoned every republican on the ticket so the fact that hes wishy washy in his comments now is nothing new for him
262083 arnold doesnt like to back losers his whole career was based on being a winner and he doesnt put his money on long shots
262084 america is so addicted to oil that it will take years to wean ourselves from it
262085 finding new ways to feed our addiction is not the answer
262086 both of the candidates are interested in looking for a plan and they are interested in solving global warming the problem they are strong on the environment
262087 they may have issues particularly on the offshore drilling issue but hes specifically said that difference of opinion is not driving him away from this endorsement
262088 then we can gather through discovery all of the physical evidence and witness statements from the san diego police
262089 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
262090 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
262091 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
262092 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
262093 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
262094 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
262095 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
262096 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
262097 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
262098 i respect and admire sen obama we just have stark differences
262099 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run
262100 im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
262101 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
262102 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
262103 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
262104 i think its sort of a fun way to show the other side of celebrity and a sort of semi normal life

262115 this is not my preferred way to roll out anything
262116 but when things start leaking and then the stories say that we are hiding something which were not only not hiding but were scrambling to get out there its a bit unfair its a bit crazy
262117 frankly as rollouts go i so would have like to see this go way differently and way better
262118 human health in a changing climate a canadian assessment of vulnerabilities and adaptive capacity
262119 the test is a measure of long term glucose control but doctors dont typically use it to screen for or diagnose the disease
262120 theres reason to believe it could help identify many of the estimated six million people in the u s who have diabetes but dont know it
262121 if a patient is scheduled for a physical he or she may tune up by changing their regimen for a few days and throw off their test results causing doctors to miss the patients usual pattern of high blood sugar
262122 could greatly enhance how well were able to identify people with diabetes

262135 some people have dismissed the cold boot attack as a minor issue but thats not true to pull off the attack all you have to do is literally stick a usb into the laptop you get your hands on
262136 it doesnt require any technical skill you can easily get automated tools to perform the attack for you
262137 and all the information on those machines is vulnerable to cold boot attacks
262138 so if someone grabs the device they cant access anything
262139 this uses advanced techniques that take advantage of how memory works in hardware
262140 since cold boot attacks can boot an alternative operating system to which they dump the contents of the memory to sift through it for keys we make sure the keys are erased before the os is booted
262141 we can detect when people try to cool down the machine so they can keep the memory from fading and the method destroys the keys and shuts down the computer
262142 its a virtual protected area for keys to be used in a system so cold boot is not able to access any of the keys for encryption
262143 its as if we created a virtual piece of hardware where the keys would be stored and utilized
262144 it is clear that much further action is required by government to address the entrenchment of disadvantage indicated by the data

262149 if you do that then hopefully that will contribute to a positive result
262150 you just work hard and toil away adding to what you do try and retain what youve built
262151 thats been great in terms of how weve added things but retained them
262152 these guys have a great work ethic great passion for what they do and theyre sharp theyre quick on the uptake and the fact that we havent had those undulations has been really encouraging but also a necessity
262153 its slowly been gradual that belief and thats whats been really good about this group its pretty tight and weve been spending a lot of time with each other and everybody pretty much gets on

262314 scientists and engineers might be the most devastated by the discovery of relatively superior creatures since these professions are most clearly associated with mastery of nature
262315 evolution is not just an inert piece of theoretical science

262317 even if the whole universe consisted of organic soup the chance of producing merely the basic enzymes of life by random processes without intelligent direction would be about 1 over a 1 with 40 000 zeros after it a probability too small to imagine
262318 darwinian evolution is most unlikely to get even one polypeptide sequence right let alone the thousands on which living cells depend for survival
262319 most scientists still cling to darwinism because of its grip on the educational system
262320 every time i write a paper on the origin of life i swear i will never write another one because there is too much speculation running after too few facts
262321 an honest man armed with the knowledge available to us now could only state that in some sense the origin of life appears to be almost a miracle
262322 the real paradigm shift is to consider that the universe is a life producing nursery and that the genesis and evolution of life is not earth centered but rather is distributed among the stars of the galaxies

262333 by calling work coveralls a prison outfit i think is rather insulting to all those people that work out in the economy every day in some kind of business that requires them because of the nature of their work to wear a coverall
262334 public school dress codes should be limited to whats necessary to guard against actual disruption to the educational process and threats to safety
262335 the jumpsuits may be just as distracting as the clothing theyre replacing

262381 i think an election is highly likely around the end of the year to the beginning of next year but its possible that itll be earlier than that thats what we will be calling for
262382 it sends a signal that the ldp is not coming up with fresh new ideas that i think is going to be a losing strategy

262738 buying the uptown is one thing rehabbing it is another
262739 this will have to be a partnership between the city the state and ourselves
262740 no private entity could afford to put that amount of money into a theater
262741 the uptown can only reopen with the necessary funding from the city
262742 we would first want to see a solid redevelopment plan
262743 just because the theater is located away from downtown doesnt mean it doesnt deserve the same kind of funding as the loop theaters
262744 this is a theater that will serve the entire metropolitan area
262745 a lot of people will be looking over the new owners shoulders
262746 if jerry is smart hell form a non profit to run and renovate the building while he acts as the booking agent

262752 but this is good enough for government work its better government work than i had expected at this point
262753 i made it my prayer and my hope that this is the end of it

262762 there is no guarantee that it wont be repeated at some time in the future

262764 that is not a conviction right now all we have is an accusation
262765 facing an overweight electorate barack obama might find low body fat a drawback
262766 in a nation in which 66 percent of the voting age population is overweight and 32 percent is obese could senator obamas skinniness be a liability despite his visits to waffle houses ice cream parlors and greasy spoon diners around the country his slim physique just might have some americans wondering whether he is truly like them
262767 these days he stays away from junk food and instead snacks on met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and drinks black forest berry honest tea a healthy organic brew
262768 the mail is safer its not totally safe but its safer

262778 it doesnt jive with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
262779 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets
262780 a quiet man he was always very helpful and pleasant
262781 one time he demonstrated his juggling skills by lying on his back in the department and juggling with his hands
262782 the roman catholic church should learn from other equally worthy christian denominations and eagerly welcome female clergy as well as married clergy
262783 there are people who you just know are ticking bombs
262784 it has become clear that americas civilian institutions of diplomacy and development have been chronically undermanned and under funded for far too long relative to what we spend on the military and more important relative to the responsibilities and challenges our nation has around the world
262785 the nonpartisan congressional quarterly calls the marshall institute a washington based think tank supported by industry and conservative foundations that focuses primarily on trying to debunk global warming as a threat
262786 americas immigration system is outdated unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of our country we should not be content with laws that punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their families and deny businesses willing workers and invite chaos at our border
262787 i believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally

262852 lazy and parasites who rely on other regions for survival there is no reason to run away from the truth
262853 no nation has ever enjoyed lasting peace and stability or could ever survive when only a few of its citizens wallow in wealth and affluence at par with the rich of other nations while the rest of its citizens are entrapped in poverty the simple truth is that the above reality obtains more in the north than other parts of the country

262920 some studies conducted by bronston college which is also located in a small town reveal that both male and female professors are happier living in small towns when their spouses are also employed in the same geographic area therefore in the interest of attracting the most gifted teachers and researchers to our faculty and improving the morale of our entire staff we at pierce university should offer employment to the spouse of each new faculty member we hire although we cannot expect all offers to be accepted or to be viewed as an ideal job offer the money invested in this effort will clearly be well spent because if their spouses have a chance of employment new professors will be more likely to accept our offers

262997 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
262998 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
262999 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
263000 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
263001 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
263002 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
263003 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
263004 the land thata these people intend to use is the
263005 its hard to think about draining the swamp when youre up to your a in alligators
263006 the government has to pay our salaries and we want to provide security for the population
263007 we aim for that the dominican republic at least in the next 10 years becomes self sufficient in wood production
263008 but another important element is the economic mechanisms and incentives to protect forests
263009 we are here to address rampant unregulated speculation conducted in the nasdaq trade market
263010 speakers blamed the staggering gas prices on the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 which opened the door to speculation on energy commodities u s gas prices have more than doubled since the act was passed
263011 this winter in new england is going to be a difficult one
263012 we are stepping up not only for congressional action but to build an alliance with dominican republic president fernandez
263013 our goal is to let the speculators on wall street know we will not be invisible we are being impacted by oil prices not only in this country but in the dominican republic
263014 i dont remember who said it but im reminded of the comment that goes
263015 i am sure there is a community collge near where you live ask your parents for money and take a economic class until then let us adults take care of things ok sonny boy
263016 movement of the oil prices is completely explicable by economic news of the last few weeks
263017 shorting oil is not a bad bet for the next 6 months the price is likely to trend down as global demand decreases
263018 no question in the long run it will return up unless china collapses completely quite possible
263019 as for espaillat he would be better off promoting conservation alternative energy and efficient mass transit in nyc not only is it the right response it is an area where his middling powers could actually be useful
263020 in the shadow of nasdaq dominican americans decry gas speculation
263021 new york a group of dominican american and other latino elected officials with dozens of community members protested petroleum speculation here in times square july 30 called by the league of dominican american elected officials and hosted by new york state assembly member adriano espaillat the protest was held outside the headquarters of nasdaq which trades oil futures
263022 interestingly that the pww and dt covered the da action while most of the us capitalist propaganda apparatus remained silent even though nyc is the hq of the capitalist media worldwide
263023 digression why did the anti speculative das protested and marched at nasdaq rather then nymex
263024 the venue is less important than the anti speculative message these people are not stupid rather they are the best and brightest
263025 your multiple double and triple spaced posts are taking up a lot of bandwidth on these pages

263030 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
263031 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
263032 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
263033 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
263034 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
263035 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
263036 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
263037 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
263038 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
263039 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
263040 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
263041 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
263042 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
263043 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
263044 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
263045 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
263046 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
263047 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
263048 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
263049 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
263050 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
263051 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
263052 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
263053 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
263054 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
263055 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
263056 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
263057 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
263058 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
263059 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
263060 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
263061 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
263062 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
263063 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
263064 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
263065 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
263066 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
263067 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
263068 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
263069 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
263070 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
263071 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
263072 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
263073 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
263074 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
263075 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
263076 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
263077 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
263078 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
263079 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
263080 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
263081 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
263082 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
263083 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
263084 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
263085 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
263086 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
263087 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
263088 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
263089 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
263090 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
263091 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
263092 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
263093 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
263094 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
263095 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
263096 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
263097 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
263098 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
263099 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
263100 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
263101 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
263102 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
263103 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
263104 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
263105 who are open to doing something on the production side
263106 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
263107 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
263108 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
263109 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
263110 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
263111 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
263112 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
263113 i want you to know if it wasnt for you i would have gone all my high school years without getting my ass fondled
263114 well you know so much about swedes already that we dont have anything to hide any longer

263116 perhaps that is the reason i like you perhaps is your careless tonuge that has taught the minimum of vocabulary as to survive in this fucking world or perhaps is your look which scared me the first day i saw you
263117 so what do you say to the weirdest guy that you know that actually has the same fears dreams and shoelaces as everyone else
263118 heck mrs james class was great without your morbid stories and happy attitude it just would not have been so tolerable anyway i wish you all the best im sure my kids will be reading some of your happy poetry in their senior english class
263119 its been interesting knowing you by now i should be used to you teasing me i am at first you made me mad but now you make me laugh
263120 in my mind you are the finest guy in the 300 quad school heck the world dye your hair back you dont give me the creeps
263121 words just cant express what i think of your perverted demented twisted kind endearing charms i think that you are one of the most stupendous guys i have ever met though you enjoy sucking on young innocent girls ears we i love you for it i dont understand i mean im totally unable to comprehend you nor do i want to
263122 good luck with your little house in the forest shared with that special cat
263123 people kind of forget and we want to kind of seize this opportunity take control and say were going to prepare people for an earthquake
263124 it is inevitable all the statistics will show that we will have a major earthquake in this region and so we need to be prepared
263125 nobody can be prepared for what we believe is coming in the next two decades or so
263126 there could be a loss of 10 000 lives downtown and the biggest fault comes from flying glass
263127 thats what these wake up calls are about to look at how we can do it better
263128 you have survived this weeks eviction and i will not be coming to get you

263136 he actually couldnt believe that ive been playing this long with this injury you can imagine that i was not very thrilled to hear that my medical team did not see this tear in my shoulder back in april
263137 the good news is that it didnt get much worse since april but we could have started the healing time back then instead of now
263138 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
263139 once im healthy im sure ill look at this as a blessing in disguise
263140 right now its a bit painful of course but every athlete goes through these patches and im just grateful that this isnt as bad as it could have been
263141 clearly it depends on the exact positioning of the ambulance
263142 but certainly the crews when they know theres a cardiac arrest as it is in this case will do everything possible to get there as quickly as they can as safely as they can
263143 expressing the sense of congress regarding the threat posed to international peace stability in the middle east and the vital national security interests of the united states by irans pursuit of nuclear weapons and regional hegemony and for other purposes
263144 h con res 362 calls for a blockade of iran which i am totally opposed to until all diplomatic options are fully exhausted
263145 the lesson to be learned from the iraq war which i opposed form the beginning is that we should not rush to imprudent actions when it comes to world diplomacy
263146 a blockade is an act of war and i do not believe we have reached that point with iran
263147 the initial attack will do more damage then would be with the kukri however the second attack since the spy is injured

263153 are mounting an increasingly vigorous systematic terror campaign of threats abductions and executions aimed against members of the civilian population
263154 searches conducted by afghan and international forces have on some occasions involved excessive use of force extra judicial killings destruction of property and or mistreatment of suspects
263155 we are sad to bring you the news that our upcoming shows in the uk are going to be our last as a band we thank you for all your love and support these past few years its been a blast but the time has come for the 4 of us to go our separate ways
263156 you are correct in that the trenching is for the connections from the internet to the central bpl equipment and the connections to the three electric circuits that take off from the martins store substation these circuits distribute electric energy north along route 151 south along route 151 and southeast along route 6 to woods mill and beyond once the preliminary work at the substation is complete installation crews will follow the electric circuits out from the substation installing bpl equipment as they go this equipment will be hung about every 2 3 mile along the distribution lines and next to each customers electric transformer either pole top or pad mount bpl will become available to different customers on different days and will depend on two factors the distance from the substation and to the customers home and how many customers have enrolled for bpl along the way from the substation an ibec service representative will contact each bpl customer when service has been made available at their home to guide them through the bpl modem activation process there has been robust enrollment over the past four weeks ibec has updated their deployment maps and is focused on getting underway once the field deployment has begun it will be easy to track the progress of the installation crews as the proceed along the circuits
263157 the importance of the internet for rural education employment and health care cannot be overstated and is underscored by the fact that the internet has only be in use by the average person for less than 15 years
263158 the process begins at martins store substation where installation crews connect the internet to the bpl system at the head end of three electric circuits one circuit travels along route 151 south another circuit travels along route 151 north the third circuit follows route 6 to route 29 at woods mill then splits to follow route 29 north and south one of these circuits deliveries energy to your home or business installation crews will follow each circuit attaching bpl equipment about every 1 2 mile along the circuits and at the premises of the customers who have pre enrolled for bpl service the bpl equipment controls the radio frequency signal that carries the bpl data from the substation to your home or business one crew should be able to cover about 5 miles per day and the crew will work each line section until deployment is complete

263170 substantial progress has been made in the investigation by bringing to bear new and sophisticated scientific tools
263171 we are unable to provide additional information at this time the department the fbi and the uspis have significant obligations to the victims of these attacks and their families that must be fulfilled before any additional information on the investigation can be made public in addition investigative documents remain under court seal
263172 we anticipate being able to provide additional details in the near future
263173 it uses lye 300 degree heat and 60 pounds of pressure per square inch to destroy bodies in big stainless steel cylinders that are similar to pressure cookers in addition to the liquid the process leaves a dry bone residue similar in appearance and volume to cremated remains it could be returned to the family in an urn or buried in a cemetery the coffee colored liquid has the consistency of motor oil and a strong ammonia smell but proponents say it is sterile and can in most cases be safely poured down the drain provided the operation has the necessary permits

263182 90 per cent of the decreasing sea ice extent is empirically accounted for by the increasing co2 in the atmosphere

263185 decreasing arctic sea ice mirrors increasing co2 on decadal time scale
263186 the extreme record low minimum sea ice extent observed in september 2007 may represent crossing such a threshold towards a new state

263200 in order to revive and re energise efforts for nuclear disarmament we need to challenge the persistent notion that nuclear weapons are a necessary evil
263201 we need to remind people that even when these weapons are not actually used they exact an enormous cost in the form of monetary technological and human resources consumed to develop deploy and maintain them
263202 the only complete defence is the elimination of nuclear weapons and the assurance that they will never be produced again

263232 we are clearly in some cases reaching down in our academic standards to recruit black students
263233 but i was peeved that no one includes the second sentence of my quote
263234 we do not want to give up on affirmative action but we have to do it in a way that is legal
263235 i tell our first year students that they are miracles having them come to uva was never the plan when you lock people out 400 years the plan is for you to do nothing but chop cotton and sugarcane and clean peoples toilets
263236 if daddy gives money to uva its all right for his child to get in thats not considered affirmative action

263240 the question we have to ask ourselves is are her personal qualities enough to offset this
263241 this person is going to get a rude awakening here
263242 are we really doing her a favor by admitting her were saying its okay youve taken a really weak program and now you have to take five courses plus a lab here
263243 we always create stories about people when we read their folders
263244 the story i get here is the sense she would be disillusioned from her first bad grade and give up
263245 you should take more comfort admitting a student like this ive seen hundreds of african americans come in here with scores like this and we lose very few
263246 she has a 3 7 grade point average on the cusp
263247 when other first generation college kids write unsophisticated essays we say shes first generation thats okay but when shes asian we say oh no
263248 its hard not to be moved when you see something like that

263251 i suppose with black students who have turned the corner and pulled up in the 11th and 12th after a mediocre ninth and 10th its fair to say theyd have a better chance of getting in than someone who is not black
263252 there are probably more seats being filled by alumni children than affirmative action cases

263268 we had knowledge of fabians situation prior to the trade we made for him
263269 based on the nfls personal conduct policy and fabians agreement with the authorities we knew that a suspension was a possibility fabian knows his actions were a mistake and has taken appropriate actions since then
263270 i put myself in a bad situation and i did not handle it the right way i was wrong and made a mistake my girlfriend my attorney and i wanted a quick resolution and knew that a suspension could happen
263271 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and this final decision is in the best interest of our program

263275 please fuck me hard oh god get up in there and fuck me
263276 this is a place that is very close to all of us
263277 for a lot of parents in general they would love to see their children be able to be raised in the united states but those are decisions that the family makes
263278 over there if you dont have money you dont have work you dont eat over here you dont have work you can go to the church you can go to other places to help you
263279 what were going to see happen as the years of this play out and as children get older is that a lot of families are going to take their u s citizen kids with them when they get deported
263280 were going to have a lot of kids moving to latin america or whatever country it is growing up in that country not really becoming accustomed to the laws and everything that we have here not really being acculturated to this country yet theyre u s citizens
263281 some parents are deciding to leave their kids here because conditions are so bad in their home country that they dont want to bring their kids there they want their kids to be left here even if its in the foster care system
263282 they think that if children stay in this country theyre going to have a better future
263283 we can talk about economics but the trauma is key
263284 weve got all these traumatized u s citizen children that are either growing up without their parents or growing up in another country with their parents
263285 its not unlikely to think that theres going to be a many people who strongly resent the united states government who are u s citizens
263286 in general for a child this is the worst thing that could happen
263287 they look to the parents to bring stability and the sameness and predictability whenever you have a disruption divorce death deportation you have the potential to have a lot of problems
263288 its easier for them and theyre already having a pretty tough time whatever the situation may be
263289 at this point we dont know how big of a problem it is
263290 it has the potential to become a very very big problem depending on how much more ice is going to increase their enforcement activities
263291 i dont know what the answers are exactly but we have to figure out a way to protect these children because theyre traumatized when their parents are deported
263292 we have to take into consideration that a lot of people who come here to work dont want to immigrate
263293 their primary concern is to work to make money to feed their children they love their homes and would prefer to stay
263294 theres a lot of really nasty anti illegal talk out there right now illegal criminal border security terrorist it triggers a big emotional response in people
263295 its not just a problem of the immigrant community this is something that the whole nation is facing
263296 i prefer visiting them every once in awhile to visiting them every week in jail
263297 wir lieben uns alle und wenn wir keine frauen h tten w ren wir auch miteinander verheiratet

263300 i thought id be able to keep my composure but no such luck
263301 i think that my dad can help me now more than he ever could before
263302 i thought id be able to keep my composure but no such luck
263303 its going to be a celebration of life but i also think its going to be a remembrance of what people went through
263304 i think were going to get an opportunity to feel some of that
263305 frankly there was a lot of dispute at the time it was granted to them
263306 circumstances have changed with oil at these levels we dont think that manufacturers credit is necessary to encourage them to explore and produce oil and gas
263307 it reinforces the idea that were seeing a steady but not dramatic decline in employment which is likely to last for some time
263308 deference to its general policies does not require us to find substantial justification in this particular instance

263316 i feel like we have cars that are faster or as fast as anyone at least thats really the hard part in racing is getting all that stuff to work
263317 our pit crew is doing really well weve challenged for wins at almost every type of track this season so this is the best season ive had so far and the best ive felt
263318 the way some of these guys have been running theyre just really strong
263319 im not surprised where were at in the points i feel like were right where we deserve to be
263320 this part of the season has typically been a stretch where i havent been productive in any of the seasons that ive been around
263321 ive been more productive this year i think at the poconos and indys in car owner rick hendricks cars hes given me an opportunity to do that we werent able to capitalize really but weve been able to maintain
263322 that part of the season is almost over i get the opportunity to try again next year during the heat of the summer to try to do better at the poconos
263323 even the michigan win we need to run more dominant at those places
263324 were going to start going back to tracks that i traditionally have had a lot of success at and do better at and im really anticipating that and am excited about it
263325 were all learning so much with it over the span of the season so i cant expect to go back and be just as good as i was at atlanta and places like that we just have to hope that weve learned enough and stepped our game up enough
263326 ill take a little bit of the responsibility sure itd be pretty stupid not to take some of the responsibility
263327 we run pretty good here at pocono weve got some second place finishes and stuff theres a couple tracks in there that we struggle at the sonomas i dont feel like i get it done during the summer like i do at the beginning of the year and the end of the year i feel like thats been the case maybe over the next couple years i can erase all that but yeah the summer seems to be if there is a part of the season where we have to buckle down to watch out for a slump thatd be it
263328 the motorist assist was almost ended its unfortunate that within minutes both of these people would have been down the road sanders said
263329 we think about it every week those top 10 finishes we keep getting just get us closer and closer and we just need to continue to do that and not make mistakes to get top 10 runs
263330 getting top 10s are good as long as the nine guys youre trying to beat to get in arent in front of you were just paying attention to them and what were doing and trying not to make mistakes
263331 i think the biggest thing is we have a lot of confidence in chad and his abilities and hes hopefully going to be part of our future and we just feel weve got to keep giving him opportunities
263332 when you look at this race track this is the track we brought him to last year and he won the arca race for us and finished 25th in the cup race we just feel like hes got to develop the stomach for qualifying and be able to do those tough things so we felt like it was a good way to evaluate him
263333 its definitely a step easier than being when weve had him in the past some
263334 we feel like its the confidence that he has in this place as much as anything its just fun to be able to come to this track with somebody young that hasnt felt all the nuances of this car and listen to their feedback
263335 we felt like with terry running the first michigan race for us already having the one race under his belt that we needed to go back with another common denominator in it and it would be just asking too much we felt like to have kyle come into the fold with the bump stop situation
263336 kind of like we did at indy with kyles road course record hes great on the road course he tested road atlanta the other day really had a good test and we feel like it will be more constants for kyle and the team versus where we were at
263337 i think mears is probably to me one of the top guys available in the garage
263338 we seek protection of allah they are killing us all we stand no chance against this powerful army we need a cease fire we need out now they our leaders want this to end we are loosing
263339 this jihad will bear fruits for your organization in the future the donors will see to that we will re supply you we will take care of you may allah bless your fighters and leaders
263340 our organization has no chance but to surrender soon the zionist dogs would already have set up base in beirut
263341 with the help of allah in the next 24 hours the hizbollah organizations political and military leadership would begin to call on all its fighters to pull back retreat
263342 the zionist enemy is succeeding in annihilating the moqwama moqwama
263343 al moqwama has been destroyed in bint jbeil tens of our brothers have been killed by the zionist thugs
263344 just blend them in with the rest of the dead make them disappear with gods help we will claim victory for the resistance in bint jbeil be brave like the almighty hussein the father of shiite islam
263345 when the war is over divide the zionist death toll by half plus or minus a few and that will be your death toll this is a war not only for us but for the shiite world the prophet muhammad and hussein of karbala
263346 good will gestures by hizbollah purportedly according to the unnamed source every time throughout these cease fires hizbollah would try to use them as loop holes in order to not have to resume the fighting but the iranians would constantly force them to continue
263347 brothers contact the europeans we need a cease fire by any means necessary even if it means calling on all our fighters in lebanon to wave a white flag admitting defeat we shoot rockets at their tanks most of the time they miss sometimes they are deflected sometimes they cause damage even a few times we succeeded in destroying them but nevertheless the enemy are advancing like wildfire
263348 its like 1 10 we kill one of theirs they kill ten of ours for every tank we blow up they bring back ten your iranian fighters agents blew up their ship they brought back ten there is no winning with this american british backed enemy
263349 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months

263382 ill tell you what when youre thinking about those three things when the building starts to shake its too late because if youre not prepared before then you wont be prepared for the catastrophe that you may be facing
263383 if this happens and youre working in los angeles and your kids are in school what are they going to do
263384 what you need to know is that the sheriffs departments involvement particularly during the early part of the catastrophe is to get out there and do an assessment of the community what that means is were going to have a real tough time getting involved in personal rescues of families and individuals out there who are in terrible trouble
263385 its each persons responsibility to ensure that you are properly prepared
263386 if we have that 7 8 earthquake the big one that were supposed to have anytime in the next 30 years its going to be a huge disaster we dont want to scare you but at the same time you need to be prepared

263692 people wanted to know how far this went into the department of justice
263693 the president could simply say this is inhumane and we dont have to do it this way
263694 since hitting a peak in the summer of 2007 the illegal population may have declined by 11 percent through may of 2008
263695 it seems that increased enforcement is at least partly responsible for this decline
263696 the census bureau does not produce estimates or counts of illegal immigrants living in the united states
263697 the persuasiveness of cis argument is undermined not only by an absence of hard data but by the faulty logic and contradictory statements of the report itself
263698 the authors report confidently about a population that is nearly impossible to accurately measure
263699 undocumented migration clearly responds to changing u s economic conditions with steep increases in the flow toward the end of expansion phases of the business cycle and significant decreases during economic downturns
263700 there is no evidence of an exodus either because of economic conditions or greater enforcement
263701 several demographers who specialize in estimating the illegal immigrant population expressed concern about the limits of the studys methodology but said they found the possibility that the illegal immigrant population is decreasing plausible determining the actual amount of that decline however is a far more controversial matter
263702 that does not support the argument that people are leaving but rather that people here are spending less money because of economic conditions and future plans
263703 while it is clear that a large share of illegal aliens are included in census bureau surveys there is always the question of those who are missed although dhs as well as most researchers assume a 10 percent undercount there is debate about the number of illegal immigrants who are not counted
263704 the center for immigration studies cis has a history of misrepresenting facts concerning immigrants and latinos
263705 but heavy producers and consumers as well since we are tripling on average the production of drugs including marijuana and heroin
263706 the kids use drugs at the same time in the same event and in the same entertainment space
263707 they make a mixture and suddenly dont know what they are consuming and this is very risky
263708 they are recycling old drugs while new ones are on the market and a very frequent modality is the consumption of mixtures
263709 youth unemployment exceeds 6 percent which is a reflection of a serious problem in the linking of school with the job market
263710 its also clear that the rigid nature of the federal labor law does not encourage the hiring of young people on the contrary it discourages and stops it
263711 effective control over the production trafficking and consumption of drugs
263712 certainty of the permanence of work of the permanence of income
263713 human beings capable of confronting the risks of organized crime

263723 previously noted the recent passing of mildred loving however i thought on the day honoring both mildred and her husband richard it was worth remembering their bravery once again with this commentary from morning edition
263724 it is contrary and averse to every sentiment of pure american spirit it is contrary and averse to the very principles of a pure saxon government it is subversive of social peace no more voracious parasite ever sucked at the heart of pure society and moral status than the one which welcomes or recognizes everywhere the sacred ties of wedlock between africa and america
263725 believe people could get so bent theyd actually write laws restricting affairs of the heart
263726 for a lot of you youngsters raised in a multi cultural society im sure its hard to believe people could get so bent theyd actually write laws restricting affairs of the heart
263727 they just were in love with one another and wanted the right to live together as husband and wife in virginia without any interference from officialdom
263728 coming after you obama because youll be representing a government whose policies grind under people
263729 there aint no way some white dude is going to go to africa and become the king of the jungle
263730 honey african american brothers dont take kindly to being fronted on you need to talk to jeremiah and make sure yall are still good
263731 obama disrespected the reverend by not keeping it real with him even if he would have had to do so in private
263732 im concerned about obamas relationship with someone such as rev wrigt
263733 poverty not the rising cost of food threatens with starvation the third of the worlds people who earn less than 2 a day since theres still plenty of food to go around at this point todays crisis is caused by lack of money not lack of food the most efficient way to mitigate the effects of the food crisis is to find ways to raise incomes not ways to suppress food prices which only makes the poor poorer and hungrier
263734 you can talk about anything through the lens of food
263735 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago
263736 and if you dont do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush

263765 this has been a 10 year project to show the coral reef resources conditions now and how buck island as a marine protected area has impacted that
263766 certainly if the interest is there we can expand on it develop it more and put so much more information out there
263767 this video is just the first step to how we can give back
263768 showcase what theyve done for the summer and get their feet wet
263769 uh thats obvious aaron if you thought while you wrote thered be much less nonsense here
263770 oh yeah well the jerk store called and theyre running out of you
263771 this has to stop it is going to take the entire community to get this done
263772 please dont wait until the victim to one of these senseless killings is one of your relatives or loved ones
263773 had we not moved fast enough to apprehend him he would have been in santo domingo
263774 there are no salary increases no vehicles no fluffs and frills it just goes back into the community
263775 i feel like ive been flanked youre coming at me from all sides
263776 we have the best equipment and if anything happens in the virgin islands we are ready to assist we are self sustaining we just need some local support
263777 the principal mission of vitema as the state coordinating agency is to reduce the loss of life and property and to protect our territorys critical infrastructure
263778 this is accomplished and achieved through a comprehensive risk based all hazards emergency management program of mitigation preparedness response and recovery all of which is maintained at a high level of readiness
263779 we expect to start implementing the agreement at new facilities in 2009
263780 facilities will be notified by india to the agency in stages and the secretariat will keep you informed when facilities are submitted for safeguards as with other safeguards agreements between the agency and member states the agreement is of indefinite duration
263781 i think this deal is americas attempt to bring india closer to the non proliferation treaty
263782 but clearly many indians feel this will reduce their ability to respond to what they see as a nuclear threat from pakistan so its trying to tread a very narrow line between on the one hand ensuring that the world nuclear security is protected as far as possible but doing it in such a way that the indian people will accept some curbs on their nuclear activities
263783 it was tough this team i really have a lot of respect for these guys
263784 the coach came before the game and said he was looking for me to lead them and thats what i did
263785 i was much more aggressive i went to my strength which is penetration and also finding the guys in the corners
263786 we talked to probably at least half of the board members down in the virgin islands before we hired him
263787 what we found is maybe a loophole that i dont know how were going to close but the criminal background checks that are done did not include military justice
263788 it deteriorates the confidence of staff whom i met with yesterday who are getting called four letter words on a routine basis by patients
263789 rather than analyzing the amounts to determine how much were actually due to overpayments medical center officials allowed these possible refunds to increase to 8 8 million
263790 medical center officials acknowledged that it was likely that they may owe patients and insurers refunds for overpayments but claimed they did not have the personnel necessary to conduct the analysis
263791 thus the medical centers level of patient overpayments was allowed to grow because all of the payments received including overpayments were entered into their operating account as revenue and used to support the medical centers normal operating expenses
263792 employees with access to the computerized accounting system could potentially issue themselves refunds because refund requests were not verified for proper authorization
263793 as a result there was no assurance that refunds were accurate or paid to appropriate persons
263794 in addition the system was not set to restrict the posting of refund requests to only the cashiers office we found that as of august 2007 108 accounting system users from various departments were allowed to post refund requests
263795 our review of 12 instances totaling 249 100 where the medical center billed insurers and patients for independent air ambulance services revealed that the medical center had a pattern of overbilling for those services
263796 in 10 of the 12 instances reviewed the medical center overbilled by charging over 122 200 more than the actual invoice amounts submitted to the medical center by the independent ambulance suppliers
263797 attributed the overbillings to the utilization of incorrect medical procedure codes by employees
263798 did not possess adequate education to process claims for air ambulance charges
263799 we reviewed 20 patient accounts and found 13 instances where contractual discounts were either not applied or were applied incorrectly as a result patients may have been billed for amounts greater than they should have owed in some instances the medical centers accounting system showed patients owing a bill when instead they may have been entitled to a refund
263800 we have nothing to hide with respect to this audit
263801 consumed an extraordinary amount of time and effort by the medical centers personnel
263802 the auditors candidly admitted from the outset that they had little knowledge sometimes no knowledge of medicare and health insurance reporting and reimbursement process and months were consumed in training and educating the auditors in this complicated area of health care finance
263803 the inspector general was never forced to seek judicial intervention and did not in fact have to issue subpoenas to receive any of our records
263804 the facts that are pointed out in the report basically speak for themselves
263805 however after several attempts it was not until a subpoena was issued in july 2007 that the chairperson of the district board wrote they would reluctantly produce copies of the ceos agreements
263806 in november 2007 auditors were forced to initiate court proceedings in the superior court of the virgin islands to obtain the information necessary to complete our audit
263807 i can however state with absolute certainty that no patients life was lost because of a lack of medication or treatment at our charlotte kimelman cancer institute
263808 to the extent that specific chemotherapy medications were not immediately available when demanded it reflected an early challenge to efficient management of a new cancer treatment facility
263809 we have been able to overcome those initial challenges devise and implement an effective system
263810 that is something we have been doing and that is something we continue to do
263811 let me make it quite clear that i speak on behalf of the staff and not on the behalf of senior leadership
263812 the patient care staff of schneider regional medical center are deeply disturbed by the reports that have appeared in the v i daily news this week nonetheless as patient care providers we must continue to do the job that we have been tasked to do and that we do so well
263813 as health care providers we take pride in the care we provide to you we are proud of the fact that we have increased the type and quality of care that we as health care providers provide here at schneider regional medical center we have a patient care team here that is second to none
263814 we ask as a community that you continue to let us serve care protect and love you
263815 a tropical wave is moving to the south of the island

263817 other than that it looks pretty quiet for the extended forecast
263818 you cannot shift the bar each time concessions are made
263819 we would very much like to arrive at a successor agreement and avoid any unnecessary job actions
263820 the panels decision shall be final and binding on both parties to the dispute and the parties shall immediately take whatever action is necessary to carry out and effectuate the decisions

263849 it is our understanding that with regard to khalid sheikh mohammed he is intending to invoke self incrimination rights and not appear
263850 from my experience of the bible studies and the indaba discussions i see a great wall being put up by the revisionists against those orthodox who believe in the authority of scripture the revisionists among us push upon us the view that current secular culture and not the bible should shape our mission and morals in this we are not divided by mere trivialities or issues periphery of faith but on essentials i am shocked to say that we are finding it very hard to come together on even the essentials of the faith we once received from the apostles everywhere we go here we meet gay amp lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their many events many seem to be supported by north american churches they are intent to push their agenda on us no other lobbying groups seem to enjoy similar access or be able to have their literature prominently displayed all over the campus and at the entrance to every residence they are determined that their way is the only right way and that everyone else should follow they are not at all open to listening to us or the historic church teaching yet it is surprising that they push all these sexuality issues so intensively into the conference and then blame us for talking about them too much through the advocacy of unscriptural practices i would say they are inviting the church into a new form of slavery a slavery to modern secular culture and to immoral desires and lusts simply because people feel desires to do certain things or to live in certain ways has never before of itself meant that the church should bless them in doing so some say that same sex unions that are faithful relationships are alright but i feel we cannot be truly faithful to each other unless we are faithful to god and his purpose is made clear in the creation of man and woman for each other we cannot endorse an inadequate substitute that is not open to the transmission of life the church must offer a welcome to all and offer every loving support but this does not mean it must endorse whatever temptations and lifestyles people desire the church must uphold its moral teaching and call society to account this is the true nature of the its prophetic witness to the world i was shocked to hear a lady bishop saying that we should not preach the gospel but work only for social justice ultimately there can never be full social justice without the gospel mankind needs the salvation that only jesus christ can provide the world needs redemption not simply secular improvements economic development is good but it cannot replace salvation
263851 on christ the solid rock i stand all other ground is
263852 dont turn on the light god dont turn on the light
263853 and after awhile the mans penis becomes stiff and hard and much bigger because it has lots of work to do
263854 the man pushes his penis up and down inside the womans vagina so that both the tickly parts are being rubbed against each other
263855 when a man and a woman have been wriggling so hard you think theyre both going to pop they nearly do just that
263856 a spurt of quite thick sticky stuff comes from the end of the mans penis
263857 hell no she doesnt need to hear all that shes six years old
263858 given the totality of the circumstances it was absolutely the right thing to do we need to talk about the team no pointing fingers things were real not just imagined
263859 this put us in the best possible position to make the playoffs do damage in the playoffs going forward and standing for something we just had a meeting and its now 25 guys that feel like a team
263860 very reminiscent of 2004 crazy day many different versions died and this happened with seconds to go tito ownership baseball ops all were in agreement
263861 delay in announcement was because mlb computers crashed the paper work was not finished and we didnt announce until it was
263862 undeniable that the environment was not conducive to winning we wanted to change that and we did that with a good baseball trade
263863 we are not looking to catch lightning in a bottle we have the best run differential in the american league we only need to get back to being a team and stop underperforming
263864 we put nothing on the back burner working on the manny trade there was just nothing we could accomplish in this market the trade we made was the most pressing issue
263865 no second thoughts but ahead of time we put 2nd 3rd and 4th thoughts into the deal before we did it we decided it was the right thing to do
263866 we met with manny and all his different representatives we were always honest even if its not what they wanted to hear
263867 we didnt make this trade because of last week its a longer story than that we will listen on every trade offer for any player
263868 bays makeup is good because he knows who he is and will not try to change how he plays or acts he can be productive in any environment no guarantees with a small sample size over a couple of months though bay will be productive though he wants to play in a pennant race
263869 we only ask him to be a contributing member of the baseball team emphasis on team
263870 remarkably consistent outside of last year but injuries and other things explain that
263871 not many guys this winter would have fit the lf spot in 2009
263872 manny run was remarkable key part of 2 world series teams no one will take that away we wish him well but it is now in the past
263873 exciting in the meeting a while ago it was a good feeling
263874 at some point we want ellsbury leading off and the lineup can change
263875 ive barley met bay i am not going to make up next weeks lineup tonight things could change though
263876 the trade i was pleased very pleased all i care about is the team and i feel very good about that today
263877 moss great opportunity watching him learning is good we are pleased that he can play we hope he does real good
263878 hansen not perfect in his time here but he will get a different opportunity now i hope he runs with it
263879 mental peace are you quoting manny hahaha we just want to go about our business of winning we reminded ourselves of that today
263880 hiding my giddiness what are you guys talking about i didnt look over the dodgers matchups this morning i looked at the as i dont care about the dodgers
263881 this is not a short term jolt of energy its a long term thing today was just the right time to talk to the team
263882 i followed the same way everyone else did at the end it seemed like nothing was goign to happen but im happy
263883 i couldnt have picked a better place if i was a free agent than boston i couldnt have hand picked a better place
263884 im wearing 44 eric davis was an idol of mine
263885 everyone has been nice everyone trying to help me out at the airport best fans in baseball i cant wait to be part of the home team
263886 last year was a down year no excuses i played though injuries and it just didnt work
263887 i know people will compare me to manny i was traded to pitt for giles i am just going to go play the game
263888 i remember in boston everyone was singing sweet caroline i know it is stupid but i liked it the atmosphere i wanted to be here
263889 i am looking forward to a lot less running pnc was huge behind me fenway looks like it will be great for me offensive and defensively
263890 how weird this may be my dad was a huge red sox fan i grew up with yaz and rice posters on my wall they are still in the house
263891 i went to a class this week to learn more about using my cricut things that i didnt know like changing the blade
263892 if you can only have energy when the sun is shining youre in deep trouble and thats why in my opinion photovoltaics havent penetrated the market
263893 if i could provide a storage mechanism then i make energy 24 7 and then we can start talking about solar
263894 i can turn sunlight into a chemical fuel now i can use photovoltaics at night
263895 opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
263896 on the oxygen side it doesnt work well and you have to put way more energy in than needed to get the oxygen out
263897 its cheap its efficient its highly manufacturable its incredibly tolerant of impurity and its from earth abundant stuff
263898 for the last six months driving home ive been looking at leaves and saying i own you guys now
263899 unlikely scenario 1 me wearing a skimpy spaghetti strapped sport top in public

263919 what makes you think i want to hear you talk
263920 i have every realtor you can think of said the 10 year old who is collecting business cards in an effort to someday be included in guinness world records
263921 every day he receives cards and they brighten his day its been very nice to see him cope with his illness except for about 15 minutes his spirits have always been high
263922 i didnt think it would go this far she said about her sons collection
263923 ever since he was 2 he wanted to collect something but it would only last a short period of time
263924 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
263925 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
263926 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
263927 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
263928 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
263929 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
263930 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
263931 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
263932 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this bloodcurdling scream
263933 we want to make sure that the process is followed as aggressively as possible a full legal process and the perpetrator is definitely dealt with the full force of the law
263934 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
263935 we have seen a marked increase in these graffiti tagging gangs taking to weapons and fighting to protect their walls their territory their name

263943 people who wear crocs go on and on about how comfortable they are and how its supposedly odor resistant because its made out of some kind of anti bacterial foam you know what else its resistant to you getting laid
263944 ive given fashion the finger and joined the dorcs revolution
263945 which were once so popular that the company couldnt keep pace with demand are now piling up in warehouses
263946 today crocs shoes are available all over the world and on the internet
263947 today ill leave the house wearing these neon green dutch bubble shoes with swiss cheese holes in them maybe ill even buy some little plastic strawberries or bananas and jam them in the sweat holes just to jazz things up and make the bacteria incubate faster
263948 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
263949 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
263950 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation

263955 wiccans celebrate the sexual polarity of nature for example the fertilizing rain is one manifestation of the male principle the nurturing earth symbolizes the female females are respected as equal and sometimes at a slightly higher rank to males a priestess is often the most senior person among covens a local group of wiccans they aim for a female male balance in most of their covens local groups although men are typically in the minority

264065 there are some that only chew the cud or only have a split hoof but you must not eat them the camel though it chews the cud does not have a split hoof it is ceremonially unclean for you
264066 of all the creatures living in the water of the seas and the streams you may eat any that have fins and scales
264067 these are the birds you are to detest and not eat because they are detestable the eagle the vulture the black vulture
264068 all flying insects that walk on all fours are to be detestable to you
264069 you will make yourselves unclean by these whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean till evening
264070 every animal that has a split hoof not completely divided or that does not chew the cud is unclean for you whoever touches the carcass of any of them will be unclean
264071 of the animals that move about on the ground these are unclean for you the weasel the rat any kind of great lizard
264072 if an animal that you are allowed to eat dies anyone who touches the carcass will be unclean till evening

264075 now i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract
264076 i never told anyone i would be leaving this club never ever im very happy weve found a solution
264077 i have three years left on my contract and im putting two or three years more so im very happy being part of this family
264078 a lot of teams want me to play for them
264079 when we started talking about my contract i never told him id be leaving this club and he knew my desire
264080 my desire was to stay at this club so for me hes like my father hes my boss so whatever he tells me ill do it
264081 our relationship at the moment is always strong there is no doubt about that
264082 adebayor is an arsenal player and will play for arsenal next season
264083 for me there has been no trouble because when a player is a true professional he goes onto the pitch and tries to play the football he loves
264084 what is very damaging sometimes is that the player gets bad publicity against his own fans for things he has not said that is sometimes difficult to repair there is disappointment from the fans because they feel the player wants to go
264085 but all i can say is that when i was face to face with him he always said his priority was to stay at the club and i told him that he has got his priorities right
264086 weve got a lot of people who are coming theyll be in wheelchairs some are blind
264087 he is the most unlikely evangelist he dresses like a hippy hes short bald headed obese not billy graham suave and sophisticated

264091 this type of thing shouldnt be the exception sadly it is
264092 around the world christians are being increasingly targeted and even persecuted for their religious beliefs now one of the largest organizations in the united nations is pushing to make a bad situation even worse by promoting anti christian bigotry
264093 we must put an immediate end to this most recent dangerous attack on faith that attempts to criminalize christianity
264094 which states that all rights are subject to sharia law and makes sharia law the only source of reference for human rights
264095 the position of the eclj in regards to the issue of defamation of religion resolutions as they have been introduced at the u n human rights council and general assembly is that they are in direct violation of international law concerning the rights to freedom of religion and expression
264096 the defamation of religion resolutions establish as the primary focus and concern the protection of ideas and religions generally rather than protecting the rights of individuals to practice their religion which is the chief purpose of international religious freedom law
264097 furthermore defamation of religion replaces the existing objective criterion of limitations on speech where there is an intent to incite hatred or violence against religious believers with a subjective criterion that considers whether the religion or its believers feel offended by the speech
264098 what should be most disconcerting to the international community is that laws based on the concept of defamation of religion actually help to create a climate of violence
264099 to prevent participants in an online chat room from posting or submitting harassing comments that blasphemed and defamed plaintiffs islamic religion
264100 the implementation of domestic laws to combat defamation of religion in many oic countries reveals a selective and arbitrary enforcement toward religious minorities who are often christians those violations are frequently punishable by the death penalty
264101 which condemned the growing trend of islamophobia and systematic discrimination against adherents of islam
264102 in which the organization expressed concern at the systematically negative stereotyping of muslims and islam and other divine religions
264103 adequate protection against acts of hatred discrimination intimidation and coercion resulting from the defamation of any religion
264104 islam has been the subject of very deep campaign of defamation
264105 theyre attempting to pass a sinister resolution that is nothing more than blatant religious bigotry
264106 this is very important to understand this radical proposal would outlaw christianity it would make the proclamation of your faith an international crime
264107 in his recent dissent on the supreme courts ruling on guantanamo bay justice scalia said america is at war with radical islamists never has this rung more true than today never have christians been more targeted for their religious beliefs and never have we faced a more dangerous threat than the one posed by the oic
264108 the united nations 160 cannibals and 17 civilized people taking a majority vote on what to have for dinner
264109 this resolution is incomplete inasmuch as it fails to address the situation of all religions
264110 we believe that such inclusive language would have furthered the objective of promoting religious freedom we also believe that any resolution on this topic must include mention of the need to change educational systems that promote hatred of other religions as well as the problem of state sponsored media that negatively targets any one religion

264115 on the financial front todd recently told the crowd that god had
264116 thats the flavor of what im finding theres a lot more im so
264117 what i am saying is that we need to back up and not identify
264118 need to back up and not identify ourselves closely with lakeland
264119 as a member of ica peter wagner actually caused many questions to come my way because of my membership there i will no longer be involved with that organization and actually have not tracked well with them and some of their agendas since i have been involved with them however i have enjoyed the many relationships i have developed from going to the annual meetings most all of those relationships are also disengaging from their affiliation with ica because of many issues beyond lakeland
264120 i think that there is a chance that many may disassociate with the ica depending on todd continuing to reveal his deceptive doctrine and peter continuing to support such doctrine
264121 what samak needed to do is to remove or relocate certain liabilities like interior minister chalerm i think hes done that but he also needs to bring in respected outsiders non partisan outsiders to show up and boost the governments credibility
264122 overall things are not moving thailand is at a standstill because of this crisis and samak thinks the way forward is to amend the constitution
264123 he thinks its unfair for one member of a party to commit vote fraud and for the entire party to be dissolved this could decimate an entire generation of politicians

264154 machiavelli and sun tzu working in tandem couldnt have put together a week for john mccain that would have rivaled the favorable coverage that obamas getting from his foreign tour
264155 which was a comfortable 15 to 17 points for most of last and this year has shrunk significantly
264156 mccains narrowing lead traces not to any sudden up swelling in support for obama whose support has hovered around 38 percent for the past year and remains at that level today rather it traces to a decline in support of mccain especially among men registered independents and latinos simultaneously the proportion of voters who are uncommitted rose to 16 percent from only nine this may and ralph nader drew a small but important three percent mostly from mccain
264157 the motor behind his operation now is steve schmidt the shaven headed strategist who earned his bones running karl roves war room in 2004 frenchifying and de war heroizing john kerry what schmidt and his associates have apparently concluded is that mccains weaknesses on the elections most salient issues and as a candidate are so pronounced and obamas vulnerabilities so glaring that the low road is their guys best and maybe only route to the white house theyve concluded in other words that even if mccain may not be able to win the election in any affirmative sense he might still wind up behind the big desk if he and his people can strip the bark off obama with sufficiently vicious force

264161 according to data from the google adwords website advertisements targeted to users searching for john mccain on the internet cost nearly twice as much as those targeting users searching for barack obama
264162 whats more google predicts that the term barack obama will generate 153 to 191 clicks per day on related advertisements but john mccain does much better as advertiser bait google estimates that those ads get 213 to 266 clicks per day

264217 on july 9 i was surprised to learn from the media that my name was mentioned in the communication to the president without any intimation to or discussion with me
264218 it is for the speaker to decide his course of action
264219 in the computation of the strength of either the ruling party or its allies or of the opposition no responsible person or authority can treat the speaker as belonging to or extending support either to the government or its allies or to the opposition thus the question of the speaker withdrawing support to the government can never arise
264220 does not and cannot represent any political party and in the discharge of his duties and functions the speaker does not owe allegiance to any party
264221 for the first time i was verbally told by a politburo member that it was the decision of the party that i resign and vote against the motion when i refused subsequently it was suggested that i resign as speaker and not attend the house to cast my vote
264222 it will seriously compromise the constitutional position of the speaker
264223 the party should have appreciated that as speaker i did not represent it nor could it give any direction to me with regard to the discharge of my functions as speaker
264224 i reiterate this with all the emphasis at my command
264225 i could not and cannot in my conscience accept a position which would totally compromise the sanctity of the most important legislative office in the country
264226 after weighing the pros and cons i have consciously taken the principled decision to uphold the constitution of india at the risk of being unjustifiably dubbed as anti party
264227 in view of the controversies that are now being raised based on a partys contention that while as speaker a mp should continue to be under the direction and control of the party a convention should start now that during his tenure as speaker an mp should temporarily resign from the membership of the party and not face a situation which compromises the position of the speaker vis a vis his party

264268 more than three years have elapsed since the offender was discharged
264269 under the police act being of good moral character and not having a criminal record are separate criteria the facts giving rise to a conviction are therefore on their own an insufficient basis for rejecting a candidate for not being of good moral character however a pardon does not erase the past
264270 no further inquiry or interviews were conducted that would have made it possible to counter the presumption that the pardon had restored n s moral integrity

264278 it doesnt jive with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
264279 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets

264298 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
264299 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

264309 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
264310 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
264311 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
264312 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
264313 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
264314 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
264315 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
264316 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
264317 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
264318 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
264319 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
264320 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
264321 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
264322 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
264323 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
264324 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
264325 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
264326 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
264327 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
264328 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
264329 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
264330 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
264331 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
264332 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
264333 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
264334 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
264335 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
264336 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
264337 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
264338 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

264340 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
264341 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
264342 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
264343 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
264344 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
264345 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
264346 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
264347 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
264348 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
264349 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
264350 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
264351 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
264352 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
264353 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
264354 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
264355 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
264356 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
264357 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
264358 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
264359 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
264360 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

264362 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
264363 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
264364 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
264365 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
264366 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
264367 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
264368 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
264369 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

264379 i think that our fan base is a pretty knowledgeable fan base so i think theyll believe their eyes
264380 and i think this is a great football town ive said that a million times so i think the more they can see and the more they get a feel for this group i think theyre going to like what they see
264381 i think what it does is were not working against ourselves were not slowing down for the last guy to get on board what does that mean i think it speaks to attitude i think that attitudes a huge part of it i always did
264382 our expectation is we will be disappointed if we dont win 10 games because that will mean that were not in the playoffs and that stinks
264383 obviously theres going to be more pressure on my position in terms of getting us into the right things at the line of scrimmage whereas before coach martz watched all the film and broke it down
264384 the pressure was on him to get us to the right play calls and to really be a step ahead of the defense
264385 now its going to be on me to be able to do that stuff at the line of scrimmage and that counts for preparation during the week
264386 this year i know exactly whats happening with the offense
264387 i know whats going to go on in practice and i know how to practice we have a great locker room situation the chemistrys there
264388 i want to shrink the width of this field i want to narrow it with speed
264389 the thing about speed is when you have it you have to be tough enough to use it all the time thats the mental toughness
264390 its a lot of familiarity for me here ive been watching the guys play for the last couple of years theres a lot of similarities of what we do in tampa and what theyre doing here its a simple system guys that believe in each other and know that this man is going to take care of his position and this guy is going to take care of his position
264391 now they just have to get familiar with us theyve been around the scheme and they know exactly what to do the experience is the big part putting the tampa 2 system in a couple of years ago everybody was trying to figure out where theyre going to fit in and its tough at times
264392 everybodys moving quicker because those guys are bringing their knowledge from playing in the system
264393 when they get out there and run it right and run it fast the other guys behind them see how its supposed to be run
264394 but you have to buy into the system because the system works
264395 i think rod has done a tremendous job of doing it his way and getting what he wants out of us and making changes when changes need to be made im excited to see what happens this season
264396 ill tell you what with the plays that weve got in were going to be real good at them
264397 regardless of who we take whos out there playing the main piece of this thing is still rod
264398 and it has to be it has to be like that across the league
264399 thats your guy hes the face of your football team hes the guy who dictates how that team is supposed to be i happen to agree with that approach thats the right way to do it
264400 he wants a team that works hell study you to death he wants a team that studies is he the best coach in the nfl i dont know how you measure that but if hes not hes always working through that
264401 all were asking them to be is a reflection of him and what he espouses i think thats good enough to win if we do that get players that play players to play like rod coaches well be successful
264402 rods having a lot more input this year in the process than he did the prior years
264403 i think one of the reasons he hired rod is rods philosophy is something that appeals to him i think rod has really put his stamp on the organization in terms of the process and football character hes looking for
264404 i think our scouts have a much clearer idea now of what theyre looking for i think last year they started to get it rod spent a lot of time with scott mcewen the director of college scouting and the scouts as have his coaches delineating the football skills and the character that he expects and wants i think it makes the scouts job a lot easier
264405 using il 8 as a biomarker to screen low risk septic shock patients from clinical trials of experimental or potentially high risk therapies is an effective strategy to improve the risk to benefit ratio of a given intervention
264406 excluding patients who respond to standard care would enable investigators to focus clinical trial enrollment on patients least likely to respond well to conventional methods and find the most effective new therapies

264432 i play 15 good holes and again i leave shots out there i cant do that in these tough conditions these tough championships its costing me too much and then i always have to do catch up ive not been able to do that
264433 its my decision to quit youd think id be relieved having shared my thoughts with everybody i felt it was the right thing to do
264434 i have pride and i know what im capable of in my mind im as good as ive ever been the scores dont reflect that but in my heart and in my head i believe it for me its more about keeping on fighting thats what ive been doing since i came out here and im not going to change it until my last day for me its all or nothing through thick and thin

264485 from the heart of our identity as anglicans and that deepest centre which is our awareness of living in and as the body of christ

264527 well ladies and gentlemen as you watched i didnt prepare a number one contender
264528 so whats a general manager to do we just cant allow rey mysterio to hold onto my wwe title till wrestlemania without defending it can we that is why i am going to have a 5 man battle royal for number one contenderhip it will be edge vs chris jericho vs hhh vs shawn michael vs chris benoit good luck to all men
264529 so i know that all of you are thinking chris who is your special guest tonight well like regis i have the answer and the final one at that he is an old friend of mine from wcw he rains from the sky like hail on steriods he is the current wwe champion my guest tonight ladies and gentlemen is rey mysterio
264530 thanks for having me chris but one must wonder why am i your guest
264531 well the answer is simple i want to wish you a good title defense at vengence is all
264532 thanks chris weve known each other way too long to let this title come between us
264533 cmon chris when i asked to be on the first ever highlight reel you laughed at me and said that the highlight reel was a show that was based on controversy
264534 now what kind of general manager would i be if i didnt hold you to your word seeing as how this was going to be a highlight reel to wish each other luck in the title match why dont i help add controversy to your show chris sound good
264535 true i did laugh at you when you asked to be on my highlight reel and i even said that the highlight reel was a show that was based on controversy however tonight that is not the case
264536 i dont want any poison in my friendship with rey
264537 if you 2 are such good friends then this statement shouldnt effect anything the title match between chris jericho and the wwe champion rey mysterio will not take place at vengence
264538 what are you talking about i won my battle royal contendership match i deserve my shot
264539 thanks for not interrupting me rey your title match will take place in 2 weeks right here on raw however tonight you two will face off in a match think of it as a preview of things to come but im adding stipulations to this match chris if you win tonight you can choose the match type in your title shot however if rey is to come out victorious you forfeit your shot and i will bump you down to the intercontinental division
264540 oh one more thing i cant believe i didnt think about this till now man you think of the best things when you are walking away rey if you are to lay down tonight or if i think you did i will personally strip you of the wwe championship
264541 i dont know what you are going to do mysterio
264542 but i plan to come out victorious tonight lay down if you want but if you do and that title is vacated i will be there to pick it up

264578 figure out how to make money off label web sites
264579 we innovated the advertising on artist sites and its revenue stream was successful enough to gain the notice of the labels obviously someone at columbia wanted to realize some revenue from their site based on our example and put ads without thinking of the possible results
264580 the money we generated got the attention of management and we are now responsible for over 50 of the sites things change when your group starts making money though they are throwing everything they can at us to try and get revenues up

264660 its been a very good evening i was hoping for a winner and now ive got three with one in the feature race its great
264661 the key to her is get her some cover so i told danny to keep her on the rail if he could he rode the race to a tee and gave her a super ride
264662 johnny murtagh rode her the last day and said she got no cover early on and she was a bit keen
264663 she was listed placed in england warwickshire oaks i got the mare last christmas when she came to the yard to be covered she didnt get in foal
264664 shell go for a listed or group race next between a mile and a half and a mile and six
264665 that was a brave performance she was in front for a long time and a lesser filly would have been beaten
264666 shell have a small break now as she had a hard race we may go to the sportsmans challenge at the curragh

264671 to all of our fans we are sad to bring you the news that our upcoming shows in the u k are going to be our last as a band we thank you for all your love and support these past few years its been a blast but the time has come for the four of us to go our separate ways

264673 for far too long in this country we have failed to adequately protect the right of our troops to participate in our democratic process our men and women in uniform make tremendous sacrifices in the defense of freedom and the american way of life and they deserve the u s governments very best efforts to promote and protect their voting rights
264674 as such we respectfully request that the department of justice directs the necessary attention and resources to correct the unacceptable and well documented deficiencies in the military voting system specifically we ask that the doj investigate and determine whether the federal voting assistance program fvap is fulfilling its legal obligations to provide overseas u s military service members and their dependents with the necessary information and assistance to register to vote request and receive absentee ballots and vote
264675 only 59 percent of surveyed military service members knew where to obtain voting information on base and only 40 percent had received voting information or assistance from a voting assistance officer
264676 moreover only one third of the requested ballots were cast and counted in other words only 5 5 percent of the total eligible military and overseas citizen voters cast a ballot in the november 2006 election
264677 the right to participate in democratic elections is fundamental to the american experience our men and women in uniform have stepped forward to defend that right often at great personal cost to them and their loved ones we have a duty to ensure these americans have a voice in choosing their elected leaders and we urge you to help us protect their rights
264678 as the chief elections officer for the state of texas it is important to me that we make every effort to protect the voting rights of the men and women who are risking their lives on foreign soil to preserve the liberties and freedoms we enjoy in the united states i look forward to working with sen cornyn in his efforts to ensure the secure transmission of ballots to and from our troops overseas
264679 the legislation is very welcome more soldier cast ballots will count our military service members deserve every assistance in helping them to exercise their right to vote a right they sacrifice for every day in service to our country sen cornyns legislative initiative will help reduce the time mail in ballots from our soldiers take to transit back stateside to local election authorities

264719 the initial ct scan on the day of admission february 25 1990 was normal but further ct scans documented a progression of widespread cerebral hemisphere atrophy eventually resulting in ct scans of 1996 and 2002 showing extreme atrophy ct scans 1996 2002
264720 diffuse encephalomalacia and infarction consistent with anoxia hydrocephalus ex vacuo neural stimulator present prior to these most recent two ct scans ct scans had been performed on february 25 1990 february 27 1990 and march 30 1990 with an mri scan on july 24 1990
264721 terri had a ct scan done which morin says is analogous to a poorly focused photograph it only has use as a diagnostic tool when dealing with major acute trauma to the brain not in determining chronic brain death and does not reveal the hydrocephaly that schiavo and his doctors claim terri has

264730 according to michaels own testimony available online in the malpractice trial he narrates a video tape of him walking with her
264731 i wouldnt want to have my life maintained like that
264732 the ability to orally ingest food and water to swallow substances other than saliva is predicated on a level of cognitive capacity without cognitive capacity the intentional act of oral nutrition and hydration is likely to lead to aspiration eating and drinking are not unconscious processes therefore theresas neurological status is directly linked to her ability to swallow
264733 a spouse cannot be forced to be a witness as to what the other spouse said
264734 is a statement other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted
264735 a spouse has a privilege during and after the martial relationship to refuse to disclose
264736 communications which were intended to be made in confidence between the spouses while they were husband and wife
264737 the privilege is presumed in the absence of contrary evidence

264739 finally the schindlers argue that the testimony which was conflicting was insufficient to support the trial courts decision by clear and convincing evidence we have reviewed that testimony and conclude that the trial court had sufficient evidence to make this decision the clear and convincing standard of proof while very high permits a decision in the face of inconsistent or conflicting evidence see in re guardianship of browning 543 so 2d at 273
264740 despite our decision that the appropriate standard of review is abuse of discretion this court has closely examined all of the evidence in this record we have repeatedly examined the videotapes not merely watching short segments but carefully observing the tapes in their entirety we have examined the brain scans with the eyes of educated laypersons and considered the explanations provided by the doctors in the transcripts we have concluded that if we were called upon to review the guardianship courts decision de novo we would still affirm it
264741 the fundamental right of self determination regarding decisions pertaining to his or her own health including the right to choose or refuse medical treatment
264742 1 an advance directive may be amended or revoked at any time c by means of an oral expression of intent to amend or revoke
264743 a living will executed pursuant to this section establishes a rebuttable presumption of clear and convincing evidence of the principals wishes
264744 a state may apply a clear and convincing evidence standard in proceedings where a guardian seeks to discontinue nutrition and hydration of a person diagnosed to be in a persistent vegetative state
264745 a proxys decision to withhold or withdraw life prolonging procedures must be supported by clear and convincing evidence that the decision would have been the one the patient would have chosen had the patient been competent
264746 re oral statements after a written living will the parole evidence rule would mean that the living will would override the oral declarations

264751 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and this final decision is in the best interest of our program
264752 we outlined for josh the expectations we had for him when he arrived and unfortunately those expectations have not been met josh needs to learn from this experience we hope he can move forward in a positive manner
264753 we have already stressed to him that his citizenship is of the utmost importance he understands that anything less than exemplary behavior will not be tolerated
264754 he said for 10 you could have gotten a half case
264755 four cans of natural light only cost 3 or 4
264756 then the suspect went to the kitchen got a big butcher knife and came back and stabbed him
264757 these are good results and we feel were on track to reach the 12 000 goal
264758 well see what the doctors have to say when they actually want him to go
264759 hes right on schedule in terms of practicing and running and when we want the live work in a game whether it will be preseason week three or week four well see

264768 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
264769 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
264770 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
264771 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
264772 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor

264789 i noticed something very upsetting today my iphone was beginning to crack
264790 im starting to wish that apple hadnt cheaped out with the plastic backs on the iphone 3g
264791 lets be honest here for a second cracks dont appear cracks dont form they dont develop your iphone 3g cracked because you dropped it fess up its not a manufacturing defect if your phone takes a tumble down a flight of stairs this is why we cant have nice things
264792 just kidding apple could have has another ipod nano or g4 cube problem on its hands careful users are seeing cracks and fissures on their new iphone 3gs macrumors has a thread about new white iphone 3gs which havent been dropped or pressed that are beginning to show hairline cracks around the edges and near the buttons and headphone jack
264793 apples iphone 3g is not all its cracked up to be
264794 apples 3g iphone was met with much fanfare when it launched earlier this month
264795 all is not well in iphone 3g land however the folks over at engadget noticed that a number of people are noticing stress fractures cracks in their iphone 3g casings the cracks seem to mostly affect owners of white 16 gb iphone 3g models but owners of black iphone 3gs have reported problems as well but to a lesser degree
264796 the more time i spend with my new iphone 3g and the new mobileme software the more i find that neither of these upgrades were worth the bother now before you start sending me hate mail let me be clear
264797 i still consider the iphone to be one of the greatest technology inventions of the decade
264798 so whats the problem the problem is this the new hardware features in the iphone 3g and the new options in mobileme are largely irrelevant to me and i suspect to a lot of other people as well
264799 your mobile phone is lying to you according to daniel rutter at dans data on tuesday mobile phone battery indicators are designed to hedge towards the full side to keep the user making calls and spending money
264800 after investigating the issues behind the mobile phones signal strength bars mr rutter turned his attention to the battery indicator
264801 its possible to monitor the charge in a battery any kind of battery with considerable accuracy
264802 with that technical knowledge mobile phone makers given a choice would like the user to think that theres just a little more charge than there really is theres ample motivation for this
264803 guess what the more you use your iphone the faster its battery drains this is hardly a surprise
264804 further certain iphone features require a bit of extra power and will drain the phones battery even faster again not much of a surprise its simply a matter of physics
264805 still its worth pointing out exactly what these battery eating features are it may be of particular interest to iphone 3g owners many of whom claim that the 3gs battery life is significantly shorter than that of the original iphone
264806 remember back in the day when you would tell all your friends and family how the mac rocked
264807 this pattern would inevitably repeat itself a few times until when recommending the mac if you were a good soul you would get a slight lump in your throat
264808 os x has thankfully obviated any concern for guilt the occasional kernel panic aside the operating system is rock solid
264809 which brings us to the iphone and more specifically version 2 of the iphone operating system
264810 i recognized yesterday as i needed to make a phone call and had to reset my iphone for the third time that day that familiar feeling of dread waiting for my iphone to reboot brought me back to those classic os days it isnt quite as bad as running extension conflict and waiting for the computer to reboot 20 plus times to tell me which extensions are in conflict its utterly amazing to think such a product existed isnt it but a phone is different than a computer in how we need it
264811 a prominent american cancer doctor has warned his colleagues to limit their use of cellphones because he believes they might pose a cancer risk while other experts disagree
264812 dr ronald b herberman of the university of pittsburgh cancer institute wrote a memo to the hospitals 3 000 faculty and staff urging them to take precautions when using their mobile phones the associated press reported
264813 he said that although current medical data does not indicate a clear link between cellphones and cancer he believes people should not wait for current and future studies to be concluded
264814 herberman said future research could yet prove a link between the electromagnetic radiation produced by cellphones and an increased risk of cancer
264815 want to use an iphone to deliver data to your notebook or other device apple and the phone companies didnt want us to have this capability but smart users have found a way
264816 were not going spell out in detail how its done for that you should go to cre ations net for some illustrated and reasonably detailed step by step instructions nb the method requires a jailbreaked iphone but thats not likely to be a surprise to anyone
264817 we had an opportunity to test the new iphone 3g in both 3g an edge mode in the middle of san diego where both coverage is strong for both is 3g really 2 times faster
264818 iphone apps are wrapped with apples delicious flavor of drm called fairplay that has some fairly open terms of use you can authorize up to five computers to access items purchased from the
264819 fairplay makes it clear that those apps should be able to run on multiple iphones
264820 if youve ever had the urge to add functionality to your iphone a new program called datacase can help you do that in fact this nifty app will turn your iphone into a wireless drive you can store your files on it just like an external drive it will even show up in your finder window as such
264821 the new iphone 3g has a nicer shape gps and of course 3g speeds in the big cities
264822 but its the iphone 2 0 software and the app store that really change the game
264823 body and screen scratches regardless of how careful you are with your iphone are inevitable
264824 we built a full solid screen cover into our new xylot3s enclosure thats specifically designed to protect the whole device from scratches wherever iphone users go

264838 potassium k is the major positive ion within cells and is particularly important for maintaining the electric charge on the cell membrane this charge allows nerves and muscles to communicate and is necessary for transporting nutrients into cells and waste products out of the cell the concentration of potassium inside cells is about 30 times that in the blood and other fluids outside of cells potassium levels are mainly controlled by the steroid hormone aldosterone for more information see the aldosterone test aldosterone is secreted from the adrenal gland when levels of potassium increase aldosterone in turn causes the body to rid itself of the excess potassium metabolic acidosis for example caused by uncontrolled diabetes or alkalosis for example caused by excess vomiting can affect blood potassium small changes in the potassium concentration outside cells can have substantial effects on the activity of nerves and muscles this is particularly true of heart muscle low levels of potassium cause increased activity which can lead to an irregular heartbeat whereas high levels cause decreased activity either situation can lead to cardiac arrest in some circumstances in normal people taking potassium supplements or potassium containing drugs is of no consequences because the kidneys efficiently dispose of excess potassium
264839 scans of terri schiavos brain show that the great majority of her gray matter where thinking and feeling occur has died off and been replaced by watery fluid with no chance of growing back neurologists said
264840 this is as severe brain damage as ive ever seen
264841 i doubt theres any activity going on in the higher levels of her brain
264842 the chance that this person is going to recover is about zero
264843 the longer a person goes on the less likely it is they will recover
264844 there is no radiologist or neurologist or neurosurgeon in the world that would dispute this
264845 well maxbob soon youll get your wish shell be dead and then there will be no way to examine or test her how nice for you
264846 many many people agree that this poor woman would not wish to be forced to be kept alive in such a condition
264847 do you really want public polls to decide the value of your life posted by march 25 2005 01 25 am
264848 and just because a judge rules against you or you disagree with his opinion doesnt mean he is corrupt
264849 i found her ct odd in that she has profound global atrophy in her anterior circulation but not her posterior circulation the fore parts of the brain look like the expected result of a global insult such as hypoxia or hypoglycemia the metabolically more active gray matter where the bodies of the brain cells reside has died and only the connecting white matter remains
264850 the paramedics were called amp it took several minutes for resusitation she needed to be defibrillated several times at home and was also severely hypotensive
264851 serial cpk and other enzymes did not reveal evidence of myocardial infarction compliment studies were within normal range
264852 there are an 4 extensive number of focal abnormal areas of nuclide 5 accumulation of intense type
264853 several of the thoracic vertebral 14 bodies the l1 vertebral body both sacroiliac 15 joints
264854 most likely the 9 femoral periosteal reaction reflects a response to a 10 subperiosteal hemorrhage
264855 and the activity 17 in l1 correlates perfectly with the compression 18 fracture which is presumably traumatic
264856 the 10 presumption is that the other multiple areas of 11 abnormal activity also relate to previous trauma
264857 acceleration deceleration injury head could have struck a soft relatively object at speed and height to inflict the damage
264858 if terris brain ct was normal 2 days after she entered the hospital than there is no possible way she suffered a massive infarction or global ischemia on 2 25
264859 summary this study investigated whether or not early electroencephalographic eeg findings and brain computed tomographic ct features
264860 seven of the 14 patients with almost normal features in ct scan died or remained in a persistent vegetative state this means that although it appears true that severe abnormal features are prognostic factors it cannot be said that ct scan is more useful than eeg since the rate of detection is very low
264861 the paramedics were called amp it took several minutes for resuscitation she needed to be defibrillated several times at home and was also severely hypotensive
264862 serial cpk and other enzymes did not reveal evidence of myocardial infarction compliment studies were within normal range
264863 later the patient developed persistent sinus tachycardia and the cardiologists were reconsulted and work up was done and we started her on lopressor which did improve the tachycardia to some degree but she persisted with significant sinus tachycardia for which no obvious reason was noted and was most likely secondary to central origin
264864 serial ekgs in the first few days did not show any evidence of myocardial infarction
264865 seizure disorder secondary to hypoxic encephalopathy brought about by the initial incident
264866 later on as it became difficult to control her seizures with dilantin alone phenobarb was added
264867 we do not know what she wants it is what we want
264868 what if terri was shaken so violently it caused her brain trauma
264869 we should fight that these kind of people never come again

264872 although there certainly may be other explanations for the findings i believe that one would be obligated to exclude abuse
264873 i am not happy about the fact that there is a one month delay between the two ct scans when the abnormality finally showed up
264874 if foul play led to her collapse then what sort of foul play might go unsuspected
264875 often the first manifestations of an eating disorder appear in the mouth
264876 the other obvious sign that theresa had a closed head injury is the fact that she had a very stiff neck on entry into the hospital and it remained that way after she had come out of the coma
264877 were peeking through the keyhole of the patients clinical condition so we tend to throw in a few other things that might be something to think about we dont attempt to be exhaustive because there is a list of probably 30 or 40 things that could cause abnormal bone scans of this wide nature
264878 the circumstances surrounding her initial anoxic episode and subsequent neurological status are consistent with a victim who has been strangled
264879 the circumstances surrounding her initial anoxic episode and subsequent neurological status suggest strangulation to the reasonable exclusion of other causes

264893 excessive amounts of the herb licorice not licorice candy and caffeine containing herbs such as cola nut guarana and possible green and black tea can lead to loss of potassium
264894 paula showed remarkable courage and innovation in dealing with her disabilities
264895 so many people would tell her she was an inspiration to them
264896 she spent more time thinking of other people baking for people she spent more time doing nice things for other people than anybody ive ever known
264897 she was a testament to the fact that a person can live fully with disabilities
264898 she would misplace things and be able to laugh about it and about other challenges she faced
264899 many prescriptions in kitchen but only 2 belonged to terri
264900 multiple gamma 15 camera images of the axial and proximal appendicular 16 skeleton
264901 there are an 4 extensive number of focal abnormal areas of nuclide 5 accumulation of intense type
264902 several of the thoracic vertebral 14 bodies the l1 vertebral body both sacroiliac 15 joints
264903 multiple areas 12 of abnormal scintigraphic accumulation some of which 13 are radiograph for differential as discussed above
264904 the records released do not include the subject of the most recent allegation under which the department sought a 60 day delay in the removal of terri schiavos feeding tube so it could investigate greer refused to allow the delay and the matter is still pending before the 2nd district court of appeal in lakeland
264905 once again my only contention when i reported this finding was that it needs to be explained thats all like the bone scan it is difficult for me to understand how results like these could be left alone and not commented upon this was the crux of my issue if one does not explain why the bone scan was abnormal or why the ct scans did not fit the clinical history then by everything i know and have learned one is obligated to investigate and pursue
264906 but if the er staff suspected that any bruises were a result of foul play they are required by law to report it so i think it is safe to assume that there was no serious trauma
264907 look over here terri terri there you go can you follow that terri there you go can you follow that at all terri come on terri no no can you see that okay look over here look over here thats fine look over here
264908 you see that dont you huh you do follow that a bit dont you
264909 terri come on terri no no im using both sound and
264910 one edited tape segment shows a doctor saying terri open your eyes and a closed eyed mrs schiavo opens her eyes again at first blush one may falsely assume that mrs schiavo is aware what that small segment does not reveal is the 80 or 90 times the doctor gave a verbal command and mrs schiavo had absolutely no reaction
264911 theres my measure and then theres your measure and maybe somewhere between the two will be the actual measure
264912 theres the results i got and then theres the results you got and somewhere in between the two might be the accurate results
264913 when they didnt get their own way in the courts they sought out the monetary and other resources of the pro life movement some might say they whored themselves and their daughter to the pro life professional deception engine as a last ditch effort to get their own way
264914 carefully chose what issues you would respond to because in essence what you cannot refute you simply ignore
264915 med student have you ever seen a low potassium cause that severe of a problem
264916 at autopsy there is no anatomical cause for the death though minor injuries e g abrasions may all caps are my emphasis be present in the cases involving the police toxicologic testing will usually reveal drugs t he lapse into unresponsiveness and development of cardiopulmonary arrest almost invariably occurs after the struggle has ended
264917 most not all deaths are caused by the combined effects of the physiological consequences of violent physical activity and the effects of the drugs during high intensity e g a struggle there is release of catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine from the adrenals into the circulation the effects of these substances are to increase the rate and force of contraction of the heart the conduction velocity and the blood pressure this results in an increase in demand for oxygen by the heart the highest levels of catecholamines occur not during physical activity a struggle in this case but approximately 3 min after cessation of the activity
264918 during the struggle not only do the levels of the catecholamines increase in the blood but so do blood potassium concentrations the increase may be as much as 5 meq l or more in some individuals following cessation of exercise there is an immediate rapid drop in blood potassium to concentrations that approach 2 meq l five minutes after cessation of the exercise potassium levels may be lower than when they were at rest there may be a pronged hypokalemia lasting 90 miin or more these extremes in potassium concentrations can have cardiac arrhythmogenic effects the arrhythmogenic effects of the hyperkalemia however are neutralized by the cardioprotective effect of the elevated levels of catecholamines thus the danger time for arrhythmias is immediately following cessation of physical activity when blood catecholamine concentrations continue to rise while potassium levels drop dramatically to hypokalemic levels this period has been referred to by dimsdale et al as the time of post exercise peril in that there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias during this period
264919 following cessation of a violent struggle the levels of catecholamine continue to increase fro approximately three minutes while the level of potassium drops dramatically these two factors predispose to the development of an arrhythmia this is the time of post exercise peril described by dimsdale stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine can can cause excited delirium if the individual has taken amphetamine cocaine or another stimulant the physiologic effects of the struggle can be magnified by the drugs and a fatal arrhythmia more readily ensue
264920 her tea drinking habits may also have played a role and she may have consumed as much as 1 gram of caffeine per day caffeine was not tested for in the hospital toxicology caffeine has been somewhat associated with cardiac arrhythmias and hypokalemia however considering her activities on the night prior to her collapse and the time of her collapse caffeine toxicity is unlikely unless some sort of pill or supplement containing caffeine was consumed
264921 while virtually all deaths in manic delirium are probably caused by the physiological reactions to a violent struggle with or without interaction with drugs in occasional cases positional asphyxia may play a role in a death
264922 petechiae of the face sclerae and conjuctivae were virtually always absent petechiae of the epicardium or pleural surfaces of the lung were sometimes present but these are so nonspecific that the authors do not give any weight to them if the bag is removed prior to notification of the authorities a medical examiner cannot determine the cause of death by the autopsy
264923 in the elderly there may be congestion of the face with scattered fine petechiae of the sclerae conjunctivae and skin of the face this has not been the case in young individuals in whom petechiae are usually absent it is the discovery of the gag obstructing the airways that makes the diagnosis not alleged signs of asphyxia
264924 there are usually no marks on the face the face is not congested and there are no petechiae of the sclerae or conjunctigvae abrasion injuries of the face will occur only if the victim puts up a vigorous resistance
264925 burking a combination of suffocation and traumatic asphyxia burke knelt or sat on their chests expelling the air and interfering with inspiratory efforts he then put one hand over the victims nose and mouth and used the other hand to press the lower jaw towards the upper visible injuries were virtually nonexistent
264926 someone would have heard such a struggle if it took place
264927 that level of activity the kind detailed above is more of flat out running a mile or more or a life and death struggle level of physical activity thrashing kicking bucking and twisting trying to scratch the kind of reaction one would expect from a concious able bodied 26 year old female fighting for her life
264928 oh lets not forget the latest claim of the schindlers that michael waited 40 70 or even as long as 120 minutes before he called the medics
264929 and still the medics found her in ventricular fibrillation thats quite an accomplishment for a normal cardiac muscle nothing extraordinary there at all
264930 t he lapse into unresponsiveness and development of cardiopulmonary arrest almost invariably occurs after the struggle has ended
264931 thus the danger time for arrhythmias is immediately following cessation of physical activity when blood catecholamine concentrations continue to rise while potassium levels drop dramatically to hypokalemic levels this period has been referred to by dimsdale et al as the time of post exercise peril in that there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias during this period
264932 the highest levels of catecholamines occur not during physical activity but approximately 3 min after cessation of the activity
264933 five minutes after cessation of the exercise potassium levels may be lower than when they were at rest there may be a pronged hypokalemia lasting 90 miin or more
264934 or maybe the killer strangles her on the bed because it is already cushioned then quietly drags her body out and down the hall to the bathroom door where he leaves her face down and with her legs inside the bathroom or maybe the killer strangled her on the couch no matter
264935 subtle trauma related to commotio cordis or nontraumatic asphyxia is also possible but no evidence of these exists
264936 in 8 of these 18 cases relatively modest chest blows caused death when an adult struck either a child as part of parent child discipline ages 3 months to 11 years or an adult struck another adult in gang related rituals seven of these 8 cases triggered a homicide investigation with charges of first degree murder 1 prosecutor sought the death penalty each perpetrator was convicted of murder manslaughter or reckless homicide
264937 seems much more plausible to me than the idea that she collapsed from an arrhythmia induced by bulimic hypokalemia
264938 it appears that she received approximately 1250cc of fluid in the field and or at least by the time she was being worked up in the hospital she had also received epinephrine and had suffered a periods of ventricular fibrillation all of which are known to cause factitious changes in blood electrolytes and other substances
264939 factitious potassium levels as low as 2 0 mmol l have been reported and average decreases of 0 8 mmol l have been documented experimentally potassium reductions of as much as 2 mmoll have been reported the dosage of epinephrine she received was sufficient to cause such factitious lowering of potassium
264940 revealed patients with measured antemortem post resuscitation potassium levels as low as 2 6 mmol l with various causes of death
264941 the most significant other blood values were decreases in her hemoglobin hematocrit urea nitrogen albumin total protein globulin and calcium dilution of her blood proteins and electrolytes from excessive fluid consumption is possible and many of her low blood values may reflect the large fluid bolus she received during resuscitation such anomalies have been described in patients in similar clinical settings therefore these values are unlikely to be clues to the etiology of her initial insult although in the malpractice proceedings the low protein values were suggested as indicators of malnutrition this is unlikely and not generally characteristic of bulimia nervosa
264942 strangulation is no more or less true or correct than the hypokalemia bulimia theory or any other theory out there to explain why she collapsed we will never know what truly happened that morning
264943 as he very eloquently states in the well reasoned autopsy report neither theory trauma vs bulimia is refuted or backed up by the findings
264944 the coroner has a sworn duty as part of his office to be objective and make sure that justice is served

264988 this is as severe brain damage as ive ever seen
264989 results of brain imaging studies depict the sequelae of the causative injury but are not diagnostic of a persistent vegetative state
264990 do you really have to have a brain the reason for my apparently absurd question is the remarkable research conducted at the university of sheffield by neurology professor the late dr john lorber
264991 when sheffields campus doctor was treating one of the mathematics students for a minor ailment he noticed that the students head was a little larger than normal the doctor referred the student to professor lorber for further examination
264992 also ive seen a neurologists record in a patients chart disagreeing with the radiologists interpretation of an mri
264993 in the period immediately after a global hypoxic ischemic insult the brain may appear normal both grossly and microscopically in the case of patients who survive the acute insult within 24 to 48 hours the brain is softened and edematous
264994 shes clearly pvs b c ive seen that ct slice
264995 they dont go on the record alone in written legal documents stating their impressions about cts of the brain
264996 i didnt say they were composing symphonies or designing rocket launchers no they are impaired many severely but dont you see what im trying to say what are we going to do with those people starve them
264997 what im saying is that terri schiavos ct could be the brain of an eighty or ninety year old person who is not in a vegetative state
264998 as another poster stated the eeg results are inconclusive because they filtered out tremor
264999 im always amazed well by now just disgusted at the propensity of people to think that they can make judgments as good as the involved parties despite their almost total lack of information
265000 clinically patients in a persistent vegetative state have signs associated with an intact reticular formation they open their eyes and have sleep wake cycles although these are irregular in timing
265001 results of brain imaging studies depict the sequelae of the causative injury but are not diagnostic of a persistent vegetative state
265002 i thought mris were needed to determine pvs as well as clinical evaluations
265003 he didnt know what ts wishes were but this is what we want
265004 finally the schindlers argue that the testimony which was conflicting was insufficient to support the trial courts decision by clear and convincing evidence we have reviewed that testimony and conclude that the trial court had sufficient evidence to make this decision the clear and convincing standard of proof while very high permits a decision in the face of inconsistent or conflicting evidence
265005 to me it sounds like a radiologist whining about someone else reading his scans just like a neurosurgeon complaining about the ortho guys stealing his spine cases
265006 besides your main point is that they arent giving a full report on the ct but youre not either
265007 as far as the corpus callosum goes not all of it is an anteroposterior band have you heard of the genu and the splenium granted i definitely dont know as much as you do about radiology but im pretty sure that the level of this scan would include the genu of the corpus callosum why do i think this well the corpus callosum pretty much frames the lateral ventricles along the midline so if were not seeing the floor of the ventricles the genu should still be present anterior to the ventricles and even though you might not be able to demarcate it very well in a regular ct in this image there is very little tissue present where it should be
265008 also lets think of the pathogenesis of mrs schiavo and the 80 90 year olds you keep bringing up even though the scans may look similar the path the patient took to get there is totally different the atrophy present in an 80 year old person usually develops over a long period of time decades allowing time for the plasticity of the cns to adapt to the changes mrs schiavos changes happened more in terms of weeks which doesnt allow for new connections to be formed before theyre lost entirely therefore despite similarity in appearance her injury is probably much more severe so to compare her scan to that of an 80 year old is blatantly irresponsible
265009 i put in the comment about neurologists commenting on images in the chart because the connotation that comes across in your original post is that they arent qualified to decide things from a ct
265010 i think the gap in ability to read cts between neurologists and radiologists is a lot smaller than you imply it really sounds like a turf war honestly
265011 in all the years ive seen terri ive never seen such a look of peace and beauty upon her
265012 the student in question was academically bright had a reported iq of 126 and was expected to graduate when he was examined by cat scan however lorber discovered that he had virtually no brain at all
265013 this scan is the worst ive seen of someone in mrs schiavos condition
265014 this is more complicated than what you have seen in the press here are some other things you should be considering
265015 in the emergency room a possible diagnosis of heart attack was briefly entertained but then dismissed after blood chemistries and serial ekgs did not show evidence of a heart attack similarly a pulmonary or lung cause of the disorder was ruled out in the emergency room after normal blood gases and chest x rays were obtained the possibility of toxic shock syndrome was also entertained the diagnosis of the cause of her condition was unknown her admission laboratory studies showed low potassium level markedly elevated glucose level and a normal toxic screen without evidence of diet pills or amphetamines
265016 was it terris wish not to be kept alive by outside means
265017 the authors emphasise the importance of getting the diagnosis right and few would argue with them but it is interesting to note that all 17 patients who were found to be conscious were severely disabled all were severely paralysed and anarthric most were either blind or severely visually impaired some were substantially cognitively impaired and all were presumably dependent on feeding tubes reasonable people may differ in their views of the quality of life of these conscious individuals but i would speculate that most people would find this condition far more horrifying than the vegetative state itself and some might think it an even stronger reason for stopping treatment than complete unconsciousness
265018 when you say im always amazed well by now just disgusted at the propensity of people to think that they can make judgments as good as the involved parties despite their almost total lack of information you discount all of the people who have spent time with her who say she is conscious
265019 and if her ventricles are blown up like a balloon under acute pressure obstructive hydrocephalus why are they still blown up when theres a shunt in place
265020 reasonable people may differ in their views of the quality of life of these conscious individuals but i would speculate that most people would find this condition far more horrifying than the vegetative state itself and some might think it an even stronger reason for stopping treatment than complete unconsciousness
265021 other than the death judge greer no other judge actually looked at the evidence
265022 have you met any of those people have you been able to verify that they actually spent time with her that they are qualified to judge the mental state of someone in her condition
265023 other than the death judge greer no other judge actually looked at the evidence
265024 given the vehemence with which he has been fighting to prolong terris life it is a little surprising to learn that robert decided to turn off the life support system for his mother
265025 a 250 000 bounty for the murder of michael schiavo
265026 whether local police had enough officers to hold off the florida national guard
265027 i advocate the use of force to rescue terri schiavo from being starved to death
265028 the radical democratic left is an army of soulless ghouls being of the living dead they live in a world of death and try to impose it on we the living what is difficult for we the living to comprehend is the reason they can engage in such anti life abominations is because they have no souls they can rip an emerging child from the womb murder it and call this a compassionate act like mengele the doctor of death from the nazi concentration camps the radical soulless democrats keep referring to the doctors as if a medical degree guaranteed humanity
265029 in response to mr pearses report michael schiavo filed a suggestion of bias against mr pearse this document notes that mr pearse failed to mention in his report that michael schiavo had earlier formally offered to divest himself entirely of his financial interest in the guardianship estate the criticism continues to note that mr pearses concern about abuse of inheritance potential was directly solely at michael not at the schindlers in the event they might become the heirs and also choose to terminate artificial life support further significant chronological deficits and factual errors are noted detracting from and prejudicing the objective credibility of mr pearses report the suggestion of bias challenges premises and findings of mr pearse establishing a well pleaded case for bias
265030 no matter what was presented they would have upheld greer
265031 med student you may know your medical lingo but you need to catch up a little on legal stuff other than the death judge greer no other judge actually looked at the evidence the appeals court the federal courts all the way to the supreme court they only checked to see if the judge was following procedures
265032 the rationale for the doctrine is ancient and fundamental litigation is burdensome enough the first time without redoing it again whenever one of the parties is unhappy with the result as at least one will be in every case parties must also get on with their affairs without the certainty provided by res judicata parties would not be able to rely on court decisions in planning their future conduct finally from the point of view of the system there is no justification for multiplying the costs and delay of litigation by allowing parties to go at it again once they have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate a claim
265033 notwithstanding the above the court has carefully read the 9 affidavits which support the petition
265034 the remaining affidavits deal exclusively with events which allegedly occurred in the 1995 1997 time frame
265035 call them mr and mrs schindler anyway because i thought they should know about their daughter
265036 now because the medical examiner intends to do an autopsy and not because michael allowed it as hed have you think
265037 the court has carefully viewed the videotapes as requested by counsel and does find that these actions were neither consistent nor reproducible for instance terry schiavo appeared to have the same look on her face when dr cranford rubbed her neck dr greer testified she had a smile during his non videoed examination also mr schlinder tried several more times to have her eyes follow the mickey mouse balloon but without success also she clearly does not consistently respond to her mother the court finds that based on the credible evidence cognitive function would manifest itself in a constant response to stimuli
265038 the court has not and will not make its decision on a simple head count but will instead consider all factors
265039 an inability to communicate or interact purposefully in the environment
265040 terri is a living breathing human being when awake she sometimes groans makes noises that emulate laughter or crying and may appear to track movement but the scientific medical literature and the reports this gal obtained from highly respected neuro science researchers indicate that these activities are common and characteristic of persons in a persistent vegetative state
265041 thus the quality of the evidence presented to the guardianship court was very high and each side had ample opportunity to present detailed medical evidence all of which was subjected to thorough cross examination it is likely that no guardianship court has ever received as much high quality medical evidence in such a proceeding
265042 the entire court file of thirteen years including items of evidence has been reviewed and studied with particular attention given to decision points in the case history that are reflected in motions to and orders by the court the case review has included clinical and medical records discussions with members of the family caregivers and with medical legal bioethical and religious practitioners and scholars and the conduct of independent research into the substantive issues in this case the gal has met regularly with ms schiavo his ward
265043 but if the evidence shows that many scientists are unwilling to be persuaded by experimental evidence then how are new discoveries ever accepted by science one answer is that of nobel prize winner and physicist max planck who said a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it
265044 the united states has thousands or tens of thousands of patients in vegetative states nobody knows for sure exactly how many
265045 an inability to communicate or interact purposefully in the environment
265046 thousands of ethicists and bioethicists as they are called professionally guide the unthinkable on its passage through the debatable on its way to becoming the justifiable until it is finally established as the unexceptional
265047 is there feasibility and value in swallowing tests and swallowing therapy given the totality of circumstances
265048 yes there is feasibility and value in swallowing tests and swallowing therapy being administered if the parties agree in advance as to how the results of these tests will be used with respect to the decision about theresas future
265049 you get two doctors from one side and two doctors from the other side and you have these four doctors dueling it out and the one who was the loudest the most authoritarian maybe has the fanciest curriculum vitae may win
265050 dont care what side of the fence he was on
265051 dont care what side of the fence he was on
265052 its not so certain that mrs schaivo didnt do well
265053 having read a gazillion studies is no longer enough physicans are under an increasing legal and practical obligation to either be familiar with or research the relevant literature pertaining to their cases
265054 the issue of credibility is a different one reading judge greers opinion leads me to think that the nurses affidavits presented facts which directly contradicted a vast body of previously submitted testimony or called for conspiracies so vast as to be unbelievable
265055 she was observed to have a very stiff neck when she arrived at the hospital
265056 so the problem is when someone comes into the er it may not be possible to know what kind of condition theyre in and how likely you are to be able to help so initially you have to try and treat then even once the patient is hospitalized there really isnt any reliable way to predict if or when their condition will improve so then the question becomes when do you decide to stop treating at 6 weeks what if this particular patient needed 7 weeks to show improvement so it might seem that you could just extend that argument to say in 15 years what if improvement would come in the 16th
265057 to someone who was taking care of her on a constant basis
265058 i could tell a definite difference between the way terri responded to olga and the way she reacted to me until she got used to my taking care of her
265059 when she was upset which was usually the case after michael was there she would withdraw for hours
265060 he didnt know what terri wanted that this is what we want
265061 angela in all of your digging do you know if the empty insulin botles found after mss visits were ever reported to anyone they nurses said tss blood sugar level plummeted at the time of these visits how in the hell could that not have been a big deal
265062 since ms has not demonstrated any qualties that he is a loving husband and has shown pure hatred towards his in laws is it not clear to you yet
265063 i know my daugther and she would not want this
265064 why is it so hard to believe that mrs schiavo did say that she did not want to be kept alive this way that is the central point here anyway not what her parents wanted or what mr schiavo wanted a court found that this is what she wanted
265065 also another thing that frustrates the hell out of me is the notion that mr schiavo wanted her to die what grounds does anyone have to think this
265066 i know my daugther and she would not want this
265067 taking people off life support in all cases is wrong
265068 who were unable to have their own independent expert observe her autopsy
265069 ill offer one final thought in this area i remain befuddled that while hundreds of documents and other items concerning terri and michael have been replicated time and again across the internet prompting people around the world to second guess the trials result the transcripts of the trial itself are not among the items in circulation how can that be surely the parties have copies of the trial transcript shouldnt it be the one thing everyone should want to see before attempting to cast judgment on the propriety of the trials result
265070 in making this difficult decision a surrogate decisionmaker should err on the side of life in cases of doubt we must assume that a patient would choose to defend life in exercising his or her right of privacy in re guardianship of browning 543 so 2d at 273 we reconfirm today that a courts default position must favor life
265071 if the proposal is not fully accepted within 10 days it shall automatically be withdrawn
265072 now this was not what patient advocates wanted and it wasnt what governor bush wanted however it was an important advance over the existing situation of no legal requirement of treatment pending transfer for any period of time the votes were not there in the texas legislature to accomplish a more protective bill so governor bush signed it because it was an improvement over the existing law
265073 as for it being inconsistent for delay and others to support terri being taken off feeding tubes when they had supported other cases of people being taken off life support that claim does not seem to have merit to me it shows that their support of terri was not based on a taking people off life support in all cases is wrong mentality but rather that they actually thought things through believed that in some cases it is ok to do and decided that in terris case the right processes had not been carried out to make that decision
265074 allow someone to die whose body is healthy but mind is
265075 please explain to me how attempted strangulation would be associated with hypokalemia ive tried to figure it out and im at a total loss
265076 the fact that the proposal to forgo inheritance form ts fund was made indicates that michael was not solely interested in the trust fund monies no his offer to divest was not a completely selfless act but it wasnt entirely meaningless either
265077 if terri wasnt vegetative was she suffering by staying alive likely so due to having no therapy in the last 8 years or so id modify this slightly from a purely logical standpoint im not sure the lack of therapy is the only reason why terri would be suffering being conscious and trapped in a situation like hers would be cause enough for suffering i think
265078 due to the morphine terri was receiving i dont think she would have felt any of the effects of either hunger or dehydration even if she were aware
265079 do we jump for joy at the mistreatment for terri schiavo because of all of the other people who are mistreated by the system does that makes things even im really sickened by the political opportunism on all sides im fed up with people who rail about lies and deception from the opposition only to defend those tactics when it serves their own end terri schiavo has been reduced by both sides to nothing but a political football
265080 reach over to the bedside table and grab a drink herself
265081 id forgotten about the morphine id read somewhere that the morphine wont blot out the pain of dehydration i dont know why they came to that conclusion because they didnt support it with more details but when i had orthopedic surgery to put a rod in my tibia it sure stopped the pain for me but alas i couldnt continue it due to extreme nausea i moved over to oral pain killers the next morning
265082 the court decision should be about what the person would choose to do if they were competent
265083 is there anything illogical about deciding that a patient without a written statement will continue to live until all relatives agree upon a course of treatment
265084 could you repeat what you said about the morphine this thread has gotten so long that i dont know where to look what is the morphine for if not pain does anyone know if dehydrating to death is painful or not how does anyone know except by actual experience of dehydration whether its painful or not just wondering
265085 these people simply refused to accept facts i e the florida law and the medical realities and not accepting the facts they then proceeded to keep mrs schiavo in suspended animation for more than a decade
265086 but this idea that withdrawal of food and hydration from a terminally ill patient puts them in a state of agony is a goddamned lie its exactly the opposite when you withdraw nutrition and water toxins build up in the kidneys and the patient goes into a state of euphoria and then into a coma
265087 if shes vegetative then whats wrong with keeping her in suspended animation for more than a decade if the money is there to pay for it shes not in there so shes not suffering right so even if they schindlers were delusional what does it matter in the long run
265088 but what about for a non terminal patient thats the answer im looking for
265089 whats right about it according to those closest to her and accepted by the court teri schiavo didnt want to live like that thats her business and by extension the business of her guardian in consultation with the doctors
265090 is it natural or unnatural for man to use technology to increase his physical comfort
265091 did terri schindler feel any pain when she was denied water to her mouth
265092 mr schiavo to the point where it will probably be necessary for him to have an armed guard for the rest of his life
265093 so he can afford it he made his bed he can lay in it
265094 i have ignored your drive by assaults until now mr
265095 this is a barbaric murder issue ordered by a tyrant legally blind judge and backed by the state of florida lawmakers that made that law he could commit this heinous crime of murder i as he thumbed his nose at every other agency authority in this country go take your sugar coating to msm and hope you are not next
265096 when someone has food and hydration discontinued they still get swabs of water and ice chips my loved one did not suffer from cracking lips cracked tongue and so forth no dry heaves or vomiting no dry skin because they applied salve
265097 two young children with hydrocephalus referred to lorber presented with normal mental development for their age
265098 according to traditional neurophysiologic theory consciousness requires neocortical functioning and children born without cerebral hemispheres necessarily remain indefinitely in a developmental vegetative state we report four children ages 5 to 17 years with congenital brain malformations involving total or nearly total absence of cerebral cortex but who nonetheless possessed discriminative awareness eg distinguishing familiar from unfamiliar people and environments social interaction functional vision orienting musical preference appropriate affective responses and associative learning
265099 even in classical hydranencephaly there is often a thin remnant of inferior temporo occipital cortex
265100 decorticate berntson et al 1983 deiker and bruno 1976 halsey et al 1968 and to consider them as necessarily vegetative multi society task force an pvs 1994a p 1504
265101 but it would be gratuitous to exclude a priori the very possibility of vertical plasticity
265102 four nurses have sworn that she became upset and withdrawn every time ms locked himself in the room with her
265103 there appear to be very different experiences of how someone dies by dehydration yours suggests that it was peaceful others suggest that it can be painful im at a loss as to how to reconcile these different opinions im not trolling just requiring more data
265104 i told him what was going to happen i told him how much i loved him how much we appreciated the gift of him i told him it was time now to bring him peace
265105 i think a study needs to be done to ascertain just what people are creating living wills for ill bet most are to try to help their families move on and not repeatedly try to resuscitate them in an emergency when theyre elderly or terminal with disease most people probably havent thought about the rare cases of indeterminate states or minimally conscious states nor are most people likely to give much thought as to what it would be like to dehydrate to death
265106 if terri was pvs she wasnt in that bag of biomass anyway so whats the rush to kill someone like that if theres family that wants to take care of them and the money to do it she cant have been suffering if she was pvs
265107 i did not say i wanted anyone to kill ms
265108 further tests should have been done to conclusively prove terris state of consciousness further rehabilitation should also have been done during the interveneing years to aid in muscle tone and prevent contractures thus reducing any suffering she might have while being alive
265109 second to wee willy winky the snout it looks as if you are bitter towards everyone because you have ms
265110 as such it seems to me that you have lacked any form of clarity in studying a case where a woman who had been improving with therapy was suddenly cut off from any form of rehabilitation for the remainder of the time that she was held under guard by her husbands orders illegally in a hospice
265111 every single bit of evidence regarding tss consciousness the conduct of ms the fact that she was denied even a mouth swab the four nurses who have made sworn statements the bias of greer anything that pointed to tss being abused or denied anything he has called
265112 to prove my point i am offering 100 000 on a 25 000 wager for any neurologist and 125 000 for any neurologist bioethicist involved in terri schiavos case including all the neurologists reviewed on television and in the newspapers who can accurately single out pvs patients from functioning patients with better than 60 accuracy on ct scans
265113 and where is the christian outrage at the texas law that while teri schiavo was dying
265114 permitted the disconnection of a childs life support over the parents objections the silence is deafening perhaps because the law was signed by a republican and the dead child wasnt a photogenic white woman
265115 although supporters of the schindlers have claimed the dehydrated woman is being denied comforts such as ice chips for her dry mouth or balm for chapped lips george felos the husbands attorney defended how schiavo is being cared for
265116 obviously the parents and the siblings are desperate desperation may lead to different perceptions
265117 i can only tell you what ive seen and terri is dying a very peaceful cared for death
265118 in the history of the case there were only 8 neurologists who bothered to take the time to do a complete evaluation of ts the ones who viewed 4 minutes of video dont count of those 7 agreed she was in a pvs
265119 even if you toss out cranford since you dont personally like him that leaves 6 who agreed she was in a pvs
265120 unfortunately for you hammesfahr has some significant issues including a disciplinary history with the state medical board for financially exploiting a patient
265121 judge greer actually signed a court order prohibiting all food and water by mouth
265122 the jewish people long ago in their collective consciousness agreed to play the role of the lamb whose slaughter was necessary to shock humanity into a new moral consciousness their sacrifice saved humanity at the brink of extinction and propelled us into a new age
265123 if our minds can conceive of an uplifting holocaust can it be so diffucult to look another way at the slights and injuries and abuses we perceive were inflicted upon us
265124 that weekend i experienced rage savage unadulterated and murderous rage
265125 to her i seemed unattractive sexually unexciting balding boring and just not enough fun to be with she didnt need me anymore for her marriage to me inflicted a fate worse than death she admitted that for the past year or so she had wished for my death and whenever i flew hoped the plane would crash
265126 i was on fire fueled by thoughts of bludgeoning and tearing her apart
265127 it consisted mostly of dreams of being tormented in some inferno
265128 mrs browning do you want to die do you want to die i nearly shouted as i continued to peer into her pools of strikingly beautiful but incognizant blue it felt so eerie
265129 whatever your opinion about tube feeding the hard fact was it now stood between mrs browning and her death
265130 i carried with me the resolute determination to sever the artificial cord that bound estelle browning to this earthly realm her agonized cry for release ran though my mind over and over again and i felt our spiritual bond
265131 i wonder what it would be like to die right now
265132 i still got a kick that evening seeing myself on the tv news notwithstanding my frequently displayed countenance in the media of late
265133 if i had to urinate i didnt wait until the next commercial i immediately got up and went on the first urge to defecate i left for the bathroom rather than making one more phone call
265134 i can truly say my wife was enamored with me
265135 mrs browning do you want to die do you want to die
265136 as these unprocessed experiences entered my throat i often felt absolute unimaginable terror like i was being murdered hacked to bits
265137 do you want to die do you want to die
265138 so many people myself included arent sure that terri made a statement thats strong enough to know for sure that shed have been willing to dehydrate to death if a person has taken the time to do a living will they most likely have thought in more depth about the possiblity of dehydrating to death in that case things are clear cut
265139 on a personal level im very concerned that terri may have suffered much more than was necessary to die
265140 i also personally feel that the laws should be modified to ensure that if a patient is misdiagnosed or a guardian is abusing his her authority there will not be a chance of suffering due to dehydration in order to die
265141 so hang around by the bed and talk to me a bit my last hospital docs saw me for seconds i dont think they even knew my nickname
265142 please explain to me how attempted strangulation would be associated with hypokalemia ive tried to figure it out and im at a total loss
265143 the problem were all having here is that terris case was indeterminate based on the evidence weve been allowed to see
265144 you appear to be able to confidently conclude that she didnt have consciousness or feel pain many of us here cannot during all those years well at least the early years of trial the money was there to run further tests and continue rehabilitation if this had been done the schindlers would have gotten to test their theory theories about terri in doing so they might have been able to come to the conclusion that they were in error but without giving people a chance to test their hypotheses most people dig their heels in and get combative
265145 given those facts is it ethical to dehydrate someone to death
265146 if we as a society are doomed to make mistakes is it better to err on the side of life or err on the side of quick euthanasia
265147 this case is bigger that terri shiavo alone so unlike most here im not interested in the specifics of cbbs reputation education or legalities
265148 malnourishment is the part of bulimia that would lead to all these things so if she was malnourished because of prolonged diarrhea vomiting etc she was still malnourished and the same results would be expected
265149 the bone is constantly being remodelled parts are broken down and replaced with new bone when youre in a malnourished state there is a lack of the necessary minerals for adequate remodeling to take place this leads to lower quality bone being produced when proper nutrition is restored through a feeding tube in this case the body is now capable of creating high quality bone again so youd see the evidence of bone healing
265150 judge greer actually signed a court order prohibiting all food and water by mouth and michael enforced it to include ice chips wet cloths and lip salve
265151 her husband and judge greer have not only ordered the removal of her feeding tubes but they have specifically forbidden any attempt at giving her food and water by mouth
265152 i am pretty certain that if i was a nurse taking care of her and i knew she was thirsty i would attempt to at least give her some ice chips even if it meant jail for me apparently a number of people have been arrested for attempting to give her food and water
265153 even ice chips are not allowed to be given her even though this is a basic comfort measure routinely given to terminal patients who cannot take food and water we gave my grandfather ice chips while he was dying of cancer and they did seem to bring him some comfort so this hits close to home for me how can this happen in our country
265154 given those facts is it ethical to dehydrate someone to death
265155 if we as a society are doomed to make mistakes is it better to err on the side of life or err on the side of quick euthanasia
265156 its all euthanasia you can label it what you want withdrawing life support passive suffocation etc its all euthanasia
265157 the reason we society accepts it do it is based on someones supposed directive that theyd want this done to themselves
265158 personally i dont see how this is different that what kevorkian did his patients were at least conscious and able to state that they wanted to die in their situation instead of speculating about future possiblities as is done in a living will in terris case we have even less of a directive to go on
265159 are you asking what i believe is ethical i think that you can probably tell what i believe in by my posts here i try to be transparent i may not succeed but its due to poor comunication not an attempt to bait or be clandestine
265160 willysnout you still havent shown anywhere where i said that judge greers order specifically mentioned ice chips as youre claiming i said or anywhere where i said judge greer mentioned ice chips at all
265161 all of these medical professionals who actually examined terri schiavo from head to toe dont know a damn thing about her condition since they commented on her ct scan which was probably interpreted to them by more than one radiologist that must mean they dont know jack
265162 but you who didnt examine her think that you know more and better about her case
265163 im not calling dr richard cheshire who has argued that terri schiavo is not in a persistent vegetative state a charlatan i think hes a reputable neurologist i think he examined her he interviewed her so just because i disagree i dont call them charlatans
265164 only gives you a tenth of the information an mri does
265165 a ct scan cant resolve the kind of detail needed
265166 a ct scan doesnt give much detail in order to see it on a ct you have to have massive damage
265167 he refused a non invasive test people trying to do the right thing want the best and most complete information available we dont have that in terris case
265168 it seems as though theyre fearful of any additional information
265169 the way it really works is that an attorney carefully selects an expert that will give him the outcome he desires
265170 two independent examiners may get an entirely different impression depending on when and how long he she has spent performing the examination for example one examiner may unknowingly attempt to evaluate the patient during a stage of sleep another examiner by chance may find a more responsive patient simply because the patient is now more aroused
265171 you cant do this to make a diagnosis of pvs based on one examination is fallacious
265172 any response to the outside world the patient isnt in a pvs
265173 only one examiner to discover the presence of higher brain function and the naysayers edit to add
265174 once a decision is made they dont want additional information
265175 although terri did not demonstrate during our 90 minute visit compelling evidence of verbalization conscious awareness or volitional behavior yet the visitor has the distinct sense of the presence of a living human being who seems at some level to be aware of some things around her
265176 the judge denied terri water by mouth ice chips and swabs of water on a cloth are water so yes i did say that an order denying all water by mouth would apply if carried to its logical conclusion to ice chips but i never claimed that juge greer specifically used the term ice chips anywhere only that michael was enforcing it to include ice chips
265177 i think that the difference is i dont have complete faith that the medical community can allieviate all the pain that might arise in a protracted death maybe they can maybe they cant but my conclusions are based on a belief that they are still fallible and there might be more suffering going on than anyone realizes in a person whos immobile
265178 permission to provide theresa schiavo food and water by natural means is denied
265179 on 19 july 1991 theresa was transferred to the sable palms skilled care facility periodic neurological exams regular and aggressive physical occupational and speech therapy continued through 1994
265180 proceedings concluded that there was no basis for the removal of michael as guardian further it was determined that he had been very aggressive and attentive in his care of theresa
265181 the only thing that im 100 sure of is that 99 of the people involved in this whole debate are acting and reacting out of conscience
265182 sorry i rambled but thanks to my experiences ill not ever see the medical profession as completely conscientious in relieving pain my faith in them got shot all to hell
265183 a ct scan is useful only in pretty severe cases such as trauma and also during the few days after an anoxic lack of oxygen brain injury
265184 a ct scan doesnt give much detail in order to see it on a ct you have to have massive damage
265185 in fact terri has had no attempts at therapy or rehabilitation since 1992 and very little had been done up to that point
265186 any response to the outside world the patient isnt in a pvs
265187 given the above misinformation i cant honestly take anything youve written seriously not only that but since youve essentially plagiarized an article by rev robert johansen i cant honestly take you seriously either
265188 ms will live in fear and need a body guard for the rest of his life
265189 he lives in fear and is surrounded by body guards
265190 amazing a baby was born in texas with no arms no legs half a brain with few very necessary facial features such as a nose to breath air basically shaped like a baseball and you are screaming bloody murder on her account that president g w bush murdered this baby
265191 fyi it is not a government policy that one must die if they cannot afford to keep one alive they can go to another hospital again you are bent on any amount of slander you can spew at your own agenda
265192 i dont adovcate the murder of anyone do you understand me in fact i have spent my life doing eveything i can to prevent it from happening i dont feel sorry for men that kill their wives
265193 the situation about withdrawing futile treatment in someone who cant pay for it or whether we should force a hospital to treat patients for free as long as they want treatment even if the treatment is long term and not helping the person is really a tough one but the fact that its not being discussed on a thread about terri schiavo has no relevance for all you know many of the same people may be passionately discussing this issue where it is appropriate on a board or post thats actually about that topic
265194 although terri did not demonstrate during our 90 minute visit compelling evidence of verbalization conscious awareness or volitional behavior yet the visitor has the distinct sense of the presence of a living human being who seems at some level to be aware of some things around her
265195 mona felos likes to conduct his own little psychic mind meldings of pvs patients too read his book
265196 dr cranford definitely does have a bias in a direction farther than i go however he conducts himself as a scientist
265197 i thought he was picked to evaluate terri because hes the doctor dcf uses for such purposes didnt dcf choose him
265198 he entered this case because he was one of the few neurologists the schindlers could find to testify as they wished
265199 this case should have had a jury probate judges shouldnt be able to sentence death bodies and life are not property go back to employment law you are better suited there
265200 im not ignoring the fact that obese people can be malnourished
265201 there is not enough information to base an objective opinion
265202 you know i really do not care at all about your alleged qualifications they can mean absolutely nothing if you cannot put into practice what you are learning or to put it another way when you stick with the obvious and forget to look for what else might be the cause
265203 this having been said theresa has a distinct presence about her
265204 there will also be people who abuse the guardianship laws across the land though i do believe it will be extraordinarily rare
265205 this case is bigger that terri shiavo alone so unlike most here im not interested in the specifics of cbbs reputation education or legalities
265206 unfortunately these same attorneys also funnel the unwary unprepared and unprotected into a system that strips them of their rights their property and their freedom
265207 when we have both guardians and judges trying to keep auditors out we have a system ripe for corruption and fraud
265208 this is an area ripe for fraud and where most fraud abuse has in fact occurred
265209 greedy professional guardians can wreak havoc on a far larger scale
265210 for those who are victimized by mis used guardianships the struggle to recover control over their loved ones very life health care and decision making often fails completely sometimes leaving the family in financial ruin and the patient sometimes involuntarily euthanized
265211 five years ago this month terri schindler schiavo was moved from the palm gardens nursing home in largo fl to the woodside hospice house in pinellas park on orders of her estranged husband without the knowledge of her parents
265212 in the case of terri schiavo according to the certification report on file for her admission to the hospice she was never properly certified and therefore her five year stay at the hospice done under orders of michael schiavo at the time his attorney george felos was chairman of the hospice board of directors was done illegally and may constitute medicaid and medicare fraud in addition to other possible violations of both federal and state hospice law

265225 no physician on the planet would make a diagnosis of a patient in 2005 based on tests and evaluations from 2002
265226 basing your opinion on clinical evidence that is 3 years old could be considered negligent
265227 you cant make an accurate diagnosis of a patient in 2005 based on clinical evidence and evaluation from 2002
265228 i do not consier ms schiavo to be comatose or vegetative
265229 based upon the rancho los amigos scale of cognitive functioning i believe she terri schiavo must be a level 3 to 5
265230 based upon my opinion ms schiavo is not in a persistent vegetative state
265231 although money having been specifically earmarked by the court in the 1992 malpractice suit for terris rehabilitation and despite michael schiavo having received well over 1 million in 2002 he petitioned the court and greer for permission to place terri on medicaid and permission was granted
265232 but the cardinal features that distinguish the vegetative state from other syndromes of lesser brain damage such as the minimally conscious state are the absence of sustained visual pursuit visual tracking and visual fixation
265233 the diagnosis of the permanent vegetative state is primarily clinical with repeated neurological examination necessary over a period of time to establish absence of cognitive functions and irreversibility laboratory studies may be useful and confirmatory in some cases for example eegs will show severe background slowing when monitored over a few years ct scans and mris will show progressive cerebral cortical atrophy while the degree of cerebral cortical atrophy does not necessarily correlate with the complete loss of cerebral cortical functions it does however help to confirm that the underlying process given the severity of destruction seen on these neuroimaging studies is irreversible thus establishing to a high degree of certainty that the condition is permanent clinical studies evaluating the usefulness of pet positron emission tomography have confirmed the absence of consciousness in these patients by conclusively demonstrating levels of oxygen and glucose metabolism in the cerebral cortex consistent with deep levels of coma and other forms of deep unconsciousness

265236 diazepam is in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines diazepam affects chemicals in the brain that may become unbalanced and cause anxiety seizures and muscle spasms diazepam is used to relieve anxiety nervousness and tension associated with anxiety disorders it is also used to treat certain types of seizure disorders and muscle spasms diazepam may also be used for purposes other than those listed in this medication guide
265237 the following is a brief discussion about the most commonly used treatments for back pain available today muscle relaxants such as cyclobenzaprine flexeril diazepam valium carisoprodol soma or methocarbamol robaxin are often prescribed for severe pain
265238 typically muscle relaxants are prescribed early in a course of back pain on a short term basis to relieve low back pain associated with muscle spasms there are several types of muscle relaxant medications that are commonly used to treat low back pain
265239 i know several people have said these changes can happen gradually over a period of time but how long would it take to show significant change in such a case would it be unusual to show hypothetically no change at all over the first few days profound damage a month later and no change in the 14 15 years after that if that were the case it wouldnt seem to support the gradual change idea would it wouldnt it be more consistent with an injury happening that caused significant damage sometime between the second and third ct scans
265240 at some point the effects of the insult cease to cause damage and it would make sense that youd get some stabilization of the injury
265241 someone once said to me why dont you pull the plug
265242 but it wasnt like he was ever on a respirator and it never would have occurred to me to remove his feeding tube i couldnt starve an animal to death much less my own son
265243 we should fight that these kind of people never come again
265244 if you found your young healthy wife faced down and unresponsive after hearing her hit the floor with a
265245 not realizing how fragile she is a large strong man grabbing her from behind and holding his hand over her mouth and nose intending just to scare her perhaps and does it just a little too long
265246 i believe that there is a heaven and thats where terri schiavo is going to go and thats a trip thats long overdue
265247 i believe that there is a heaven and thats where terri schiavo is going to go and thats a trip thats long overdue
265248 if there can be no fault divorces and no fault car accident rulings
265249 why cant we bring that same reasoning to family legal matters especially since so much hurtful emotion was inflamed by the schiavo case in order to prevent such hostile situations in the future i am joining a national movement for putting the legal mechanics in place for peaceful solutions in these matters
265250 having spent personal time with terri and feeling a strong sense of compassion for her plight
265251 i think that while people still remember this case we can use those memories positively to help other families in the future

265257 no prima facie evidence that terri schiavos mental abilities or or capabilities are completely eradicated
265258 20 years of seeing more than 10 000 cts of the brain
265259 looking into their eyes and letting their spirit speak directly to him
265260 how could they gage serial brain degeneration without serial follow up
265261 i have seen many walking talking fairly coherent people with worse cerebral cortical atrophy
265262 my girlfriend has done more for terri than her own mother
265263 throughout the course of the litigation deposition and trial testimony by members of the schindler family voiced the disturbing belief that they would keep theresa alive at any and all costs nearly gruesome examples were given eliciting agreement by family members that in the event theresa should contract diabetes and subsequent gangrene in each of her limbs they would agree to amputate each limb and would then were she to be diagnosed with heart disease perform open heart surgery there was additional difficult testimony that appeared to establish that despite the sad and undesirable condition of theresa the parents still derived joy from having her alive even if theresa might not be at all aware of her environment given the persistent vegetative state within the testimony as part of the hypotheticals presented schindler family members stated that even if theresa had told them of her intention to have artificial nutrition withdrawn they would not do it throughout this painful and difficult trial the family acknowledged that theresa was in a diagnosed persistent vegetative state
265264 that he has reached a point that he has no hope of the wards recovery and wants to get on with his own life
265265 mr schiavo will realize a substantial and fairly immediate financial gain if his application for withdrawal of life support tube supplied food and water is granted
265266 his credibility is necessarily adversely affected by the obvious financial benefit to him of being the wards sole heir at law in the event of her death while still married to him her death also permits him to get on with his own life
265267 given the inherent problems already mentioned together with the fact that the ward has been maintained the life support measures sought to be withdrawn for the past 8 years it is the recommendation of the guardian ad litem that the petition for removal be denied
265268 we know about the thalamic implants but a shunt is a completely different procedure from what i understand they have been using that argument to preclude her from getting an mri but other comments here would seem to indicate otherwise was a shunt placement part of the original experimental protocol
265269 if there is a electro stimulatory device it would be placed in the thalamus even allowing for incompetent placement doesnt change what we see on the image which is a shunt and nothing else perhaps the word stent was used
265270 granted it is severely thinned especially for terris age but i would be nonplussed if you told me that this was a 75 year old female who was somewhat senile but fully functional and i defy a radiologist anywhere to contest that
265271 its not about fill in the blank its about terri
265272 in late autumn of 1990 following months of therapy and testing formal diagnoses of persistent vegetative state with no evidence of improvement michael took theresa to california where she received an experimental thalamic stimulator implant in her brain
265273 sorry j2 no one with any expertise in this matter has claimed schiavo is dead by any recognized standard

265282 it makes no sense at to put a feeding tube in them
265283 of the trilogy of disease diagnosis prognosis and treatment prognosis is the most difficult to evaluate the accurate prediction of things to come is often most baffling perplexing and problematic
265284 im very deeply disturbed by what goes on at present
265285 this is me somebody who was not dying and yet was to a certain extent condemned to death given a hopeless prognosis
265286 we dont know as much as we think we do doctors and nurses
265287 although nearly everyone agrees that frank open and honest communication between a patient and his doctor is optimal on this one absolutely crucial issue it remains very much the exception
265288 as a consequence two out of three patients may have to make important medical and personal decisions based on missing or unreliable information
265289 if physicians infrequently provide frank disclosure to hospice patients with cancer who request it
265290 they may be even less likely to provide it to non hospice patients with or without cancer
265291 are physicians with strong conservative credentials who obviously dont know the facts of the case
265292 dont mind the restraints they are there for your protection
265293 this is setting personal right to die end of life movements back years because of this

265300 march 9 2005 judge greer denies schindlers motion requesting new tests
265301 they were requesting additional tests as a delaying tactic i suspect that had the motion been granted they would have continued to request additional tests year after year after year
265302 i suspect that had the motion been granted they would have continued to request additional tests year after year after year
265303 there is where you and i differ i believe it is cruel and unjust to keep her beautiful spirit trapped in such a nonfunctional body once released from her damamged physical vessel she can be whole again

265309 it occurs to me that you simply want publicity for your
265310 the fact that two eegs showed no electrical activity in the brain is more telling than the ct scan and the clinical judgment of 4 board certified neurologists is the best indicator of whether she is vegetative they agree that she is the chances of even minimal recovery after 15 years shunt or no shunt are close to zero and the chances of full recovery are zero
265311 if it were a wire electrode passing through the ventricle to the thalamus it would be oriented side to side or transversely

265349 are you just ignoring this information because it doesnt support your position
265350 terri might have been bulimic but i seriously doubt she had osteoporosis and thus had bone fractures given her age
265351 you know i can neither explain this further or better if you do not understand what blogging is about so be it i stand by what ive said
265352 there is categorically and absolutely no way terri could have suffered massive anoxic injury to the brain on 2 25 and have normal ct scan on 2 27
265353 ct scan shows noncommunicating hydrocephalus changes occurred since 2 27 exam
265354 so terri was hit on the head or dropped on her head during later february or early march while in that hospital

265357 it is irresponsible to assume that a medical imaging study which bears the name of a patient does not belong to that patient
265358 a clinical condition of complete unawareness of the self and the environment
265359 the primary basis for the diagnosis of pvs is the careful and extended clinical observation of the patient supported by laboratory studies
265360 pvs patients will show no behavioral response whatsoever over an extended period of time
265361 no evidence of sustained reproducible purposeful or voluntary behavioral responses to visual auditory tactile or noxious stimuli
265362 the length of the reflex depends on the direction sic of the stimulation
265363 testimony at prior evidentiary hearings did establish that patients in a persistent vegetative state like terri schiavo could utter words from time to time
265364 show no behavioral indication of any awareness of pain or suffering
265365 the chance of survival past 15 years is approximately 1 15 000 to 1 75 000
265366 but the cardinal features that distinguish the vegetative state from other syndromes of lesser brain damage such as the minimally conscious state are the absence of sustained visual pursuit visual tracking and visual fixation the eyes do not follow objects or persons nor do they fixate on these objects or persons and when patients do emerge from the vegetative state almost invariably the first and most reliable sign of improvement is the ability to visually track objects or persons in a consistent sustained and reproducible fashion
265367 likely risks and burdens of treatment ie feeding tubes would outweigh the expected benefits
265368 gosh this lady has more problems than terri did and she isnt being sent off to the cemetery
265369 i mean they think whats her name was in bad shape we got lotsamore patients worse
265370 hypokalemia has been suggested as a predisposing factor to the development of fatal arrhythmias in acute myocardial infarction evidence cited to support this concept has been derived largely from studies in which the determination of the serum potassium level was made following a cardiac arrhythmia and or arrest and often following cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr this postresuscitation potassium level has been considered to be representative of the prearrest value in the patient described herein serial determinations of serum potassium obtained fortuitously before and intentionally following sudden unexpected cardiac arrest in a hospitalized patient demonstrate that the prearrest serum potassium level cannot be inferred from electrolyte values obtained after cpr
265371 postresuscitation hypokalemia in a patient with a normal prearrest serum potassium level
265372 mrs schiavo was an attractive and fun loving individual what do you think she would have wanted
265373 the primary basis for the diagnosis of pvs is the careful and extended clinical observation of the patient supported by laboratory studies something that was not done in terris case
265374 a blood clot that lodged in her lung and caused her to stop breathing while her son was being delivered by caesarean section
265375 the vegetative state needs considerable skill to diagnose requiring assessment over a period of time diagnosis cannot be made even by the most experienced clinician from a bedside assessment accurate diagnosis is possible but requires the skills of a multidisciplinary team experienced in the management of people with complex disabilities
265376 first off no information were given about the 10 persistent or 13 emerging patients age time since injury type of injury etc
265377 second there were no rationale or criteria stated as to how a patient was categorized as one of the 17
265378 patients were considered to have been misdiagnosed if they could follow commands consistently within our initial assessment period of six weeks
265379 third all types of head injury were considered the same in the statistical analysis
265380 another thing becomes evident when analyzing the numbers another way by two years post injury only 3 cases were misdiagnosed 5 years post injury only 1 case 7 years none
265381 that bone scan describes her as having a head injury thats why shes there
265382 first off no information were given about the 10 persistent or 13 emerging patients age time since injury type of injury etc
265383 second there were no rationale or criteria stated as to how a patient was categorized as one of the 17
265384 patients were considered to have been misdiagnosed if they could follow commands consistently within our initial assessment period of six weeks
265385 third all types of head injury were considered the same in the statistical analysis
265386 another thing becomes evident when analyzing the numbers another way by two years post injury only 3 cases were misdiagnosed 5 years post injury only 1 case 7 years none
265387 from the get go this was nothing but a political intervention there was and continues to be no reason for them to have been involved
265388 the reports speaks for itself we have a duty to protect the vulnerable and investigate allegations of abuse
265389 the spouse has always been courteous and very compassionate toward his wife
265390 she stated that her information on current infections and lack of treatment was from yahoo chatline
265391 in the latest round dcf says he exploited her financially but as these records show they were well aware michael had no control over the money
265392 standing orders were that the family wasnt to be contacted but i would call them anyway because i thought they should know about their daughter
265393 from what i understand if a neurologist says that the patient is
265394 since she was only 26 at the time osteoporosis is not a possible diagnosis
265395 what you recover within 1 to 1 1 2 years is all you can hope for
265396 each of the following has been involved in some way with the promotion or administration of questionable health products and or services many of them have written at least one book that i believe contains invalid information most appear to hold sincere beliefs those marked with a red asterisk have been subjected to regulatory or enforcement action nonaccredited degrees are marked with black asterisks each asterisk represents one action or degree click on each name to see the reason they are on this list
265397 that is diffeent from cranfords and judge greers definition which would insert the word and where the aan and florida law say or
265398 during that time the gal was not able to independently determine that there were consistent repetitive intentional reproducible interactive and aware activities
265399 she terri would let you know when she had a bowel movement by flipping up the covers and pulling on her diaper
265400 you would always tell when terri had a bowel movement as she seem ed agitated and would sort of scoot to get away from it
265401 you did see that hacking out in utah finally admitted her went in the
265402 she had found out he had lied about his whole life that he had graduated from collete that he was registered for medical school the whole 9 yards
265403 as well as the food allergies heliobactor pylori can also cause a problem with vomiting until it is diagnosed and treated not all ulcers are caused by the heliobactor pylori bacteria and that leaves open the fact that untreated ulcers can cause a person to throw up after a meal it can also cause the stomach cramps and diarrhoea that were experienced by terri but that might not have been her problem
265404 they breathe blink move their eyes may make noises though no words and show reflex responses
265405 i still have questions regarding the acceptance of bulimia as the cause of the collapse she had just gotten out of bed a high blood glucose level at that hour of the morning does not add up
265406 correction in this item media matters previously wrote that the florida board of medicine disciplined hammesfahr in 2003 we have subsequently learned that the boards action was reversed on appeal in 2004 by the florida 2nd district court of appeal we regret the error
265407 given that ts was non communicative she presumably did not complain of pain so that the indication for the bone scan may have been based on abnormal laboratory values
265408 certainly on the infamous one slice ct brain that we were given the occipital lobes looked to be in poor condition therefore i doubt that she had any real visual interpretation going on
265409 there is no spared cortical tissue that can take over some of the destroyed brain function
265410 if she indeed at any point was able to make intelligible speech i believe that her family would have recorded it
265411 incidentally i believe that her long survival is a tribute to her fine hospice care not to her neurological status
265412 if mrs s had had an advance medical directive none of this would have come up
265413 when mae magouirk drew up a living will she believed that it would protect her in her twilight years and head off any family squabbling over medical care at the end of her life
265414 if her family had agreed on her wishes none of this would have come up
265415 persons in pvs and others who are dying starve themselves to death every day that is what my aunt and my husbands grandmother did
265416 the schindlers were not with mrs s when she died because her husband was with her they visited her shortly afterwards
265417 i await the results of her autopsy and postmortem xrays with great interest
265418 the vegetative is the most important and certainly is the single determining factor for overall quality of life for that patient
265419 i noticed that nothing was said about the other schindler children
265420 i am absolutely blown away when i have spoken to friends and strangers standing in line at the grocery etc and mention the schiavo case
265421 these people are very adamant that terri should have been allowed to die
265422 if that chair was inadequate and terri did fall out of it or she was roughly placed into the chair or she was made to fall out of bed yes that kind of injury is possible
265423 we didnt know what she wanted but thats what we wanted
265424 why would ms want terri dead and and not divorce her instead if he was abusive and there was any chance at all she would recover she might talk
265425 i havent brought this up before because i dont feel that i can explain it very well but i cant let it go anymore
265426 for a few seconds there 5 or 10 seconds 18 her eyes were going up and down to the right and 19 to left trying to follow that multicolored 20 balloon
265427 occasional reaction that implies the presence of some type of sensory input
265428 in many patients there are features that imply that perhaps there is a reaction that does take place but its not sustained
265429 it would draw into question as to whether or not that actually represented cognition
265430 it was a reproducible phenomenon when i observed the patient under three different days with her mother
265431 supposed mrs s had gotten her tube back she would have left the hospice and probably ended up in a medicaid facility the florida taxpayers paying the 80 000 100 000 year to support her
265432 some bulimics do not purge these people instead exercise excessively or fast such as voluntarily going on a liquid diet sound familiar so there would be no tissue damage in the throat or decay of the teeth
265433 i know many of you are going to hate this comment but it is the truth
265434 we cannot permit 3 the physician assisted suicide any more than we can 4 permit suicide
265435 she must be in a 13 persistent vegetative state or terminal or an end 14 stage
265436 when she suffered a heart attack that caused permanent brain damage
265437 rightfully think that heart failure was the cause of brain damage but this is not necessarily so
265438 for instance the nurses testified that their notes from the shift with terri were written on a separate piece of paper and transferred into her medical records by someone else at a later time this would make it far more simple to leave something out of the chart in that process than to remove it once it was officially in there
265439 the court finds that based on the credible evidence cognitive function would manifest itself in a constant response to stimuli
265440 patients in a vegetative state show no none nada zero in logic this is known as an
265441 an inability to communicate or interact purposefully with the environment
265442 the absence of voluntary action or cognitive behavior of any kind
265443 persistent vegetative state patients do not have the capacity to experience pain or suffering
265444 pvs can be judged to be permanent 12 months after taumatic injury in adults and children
265445 recovery of consciousness can be verified when a patient shows reliable evidence of awareness of self and the environment consistent appearance of voluntary behavioral responses to visual and auditory stimuli and interaction with others
265446 god doesnt give you the ticket before you need to get on the train
265447 this was not a case of witholding artificially life prolonging medical care it was a case of euthanasia or possibly assisted suicide
265448 i never believed that terri told her husband any such thing about
265449 what did you just say to her she just sat up and tried to get out of her chair
265450 funny how there is no mention of looking for a valium od when she had access to valium michaels and he is saying
265451 the hydranencephalic patients brains developed that way her brain was devastated by injury to look that way its not even apples and oranges its more like apples and skyscrapers
265452 oh and terri said she wants to be put out of her misery asap
265453 in 1992 attorney gary fox represented michael schiavo in a medical
265454 clinical practice shows how puzzling it is to recognize unambiguous signs of conscious perception of the environment and of the self in these patients this difficulty is reflected by frequent misdiagnoses of locked in syndrome coma minimally conscious state and vegetative state childs et al 1993 andrews et al 1996 objective assessment of residual brain function is difficult in patients with severe brain injury because their motor responses may be limited or inconsistent laureys et al 2002b in addition consciousness is not an all or none phenomenon but should rather be conceptualized as a continuum between different states wade and johnston 1999 there is also a theoretical limitation to the certainty of our clinical diagnosis since we can only infer the presence or absence of conscious experience in another person bernat 1992
265455 patients in a vegetative state usually show reflex or spontaneous eye opening and breathing
265456 clinical eeg evoked potentials ep or structural imaging data do not permit to reliably predict the prognosis of individual vegetative patients jennett 2002
265457 no evidence of awareness of self or environment and an inability to interact with others
265458 no evidence of sustained reproducible purposeful or voluntary behavioral responses to visual auditory tactile or noxious stimuli
265459 she wasnt demented and only somewhat incapacitated are you serious that is just complete denial i think its very sad what happened to her but that doesnt change the fact that it happened she had basically no cortex left
265460 she wasnt demented and only somewhat incapacitated are you serious that is just complete denial i think its very sad what happened to her but that doesnt change the fact that it happened she had basically no cortex left
265461 the family was removed from the room because they were making a scene her brother admitted that he was causing a scene on hannity and colmes
265462 recovery of consciousness can be verified when a patient shows reliable evidence of awareness of self and the environment consistent appearance of voluntary behavioral responses to visual and auditory stimuli and interaction with others
265463 i know many of you are going to hate this comment but it is the truth it doesnt matter if she was pvs or not the outcome would have been the same either way even if she wasnt pvs she still would have been ruled incompetent to decide things for herself and would have been placed under the care of a guardian
265464 ill say again that im not certain she was pvs but as ive said with that several times i dont think it really matters whether she was or not ive expounded on this in previous posts
265465 because their brain stem is still intact people in a vegetative state can follow things with their eyes but only slightly to the left or to the right bernat said
265466 even if she was responding in all of those instances i can still say with a fair amount of confidence that that was not the same terri schiavo
265467 they may be saying a word or smile but it is intermittent
265468 even if she was responding in all of those instances i can still say with a fair amount of confidence that that was not the same terri schiavo it wasnt her personality that was just unable to get out she had severely limited cognitive abilities as a best case scenario
265469 i think youre missing the point that this is a situation with a woman who is just barely functional at best and had expressed a wish as ruled on by many judges to not be kept alive in such a state
265470 the other problem i have with so many of the posts here is that they completely deny the fact that this may be what she wanted
265471 there are multiple witnesses documenting the fact that she responded by showing joy when someone she liked came to visit her and that she cried when they left she closed her eyes and attempted to bow her head for the duration of prayer when a priest came to visit her
265472 she always looks up and smiles when she hears his big booming voice
265473 she knows hes a priest and she knows what hes doing
265474 there was no testimony or evidence given in court by any doctor who had examined terri for more than an hour or so before diagnosing her with pvs
265475 would terri schiavos autopsy take approximately the same amount of time
265476 american congress of rehabilitation medicine advocated to abandon the term permanent
265477 vegetative patients can make a range of spontaneous movements including chewing teeth grinding and swallowing
265478 these abilities are also seen in another group of patients showing preserved wakefulness without awareness namely infants with anencephaly and are considered to be of sub cortical origin the medical task force on anencephaly 1990
265479 any evidence of communication including a consistent response to command or any purposeful movement rules out the diagnosis
265480 clinical eeg evoked potentials ep or structural imaging data do not permit to reliably predict the prognosis of individual vegetative patients jennett 2002
265481 the lack of cortex in hydranencephalics is the only thing that is relevant to terri schiavo it matters not how the brain got this way what matters is what functions are still plausible in the case of terri and my son jason is it just possible that the brain stem takes over for some of the functions thought only to be located in the cortex
265482 there was no testimony or evidence given in court by any doctor who had examined terri for more than an hour or so before diagnosing her with pvs
265483 i often wondered if she really couldnt swallow or if she just didnt want to do it for those weird people in some x ray room or whatever strange arrangement it evolved the way they described her holding the bolus in her mouth but they couldnt make her swallow while noting she did not aspirate it either i cant help wondering if it was merely her lacking consciousness or if she was not swallowing just like a baby conveying you cant make me they said she could taste
265484 it is perhaps significant that many of the instances in which gross enlargement of cerebral ventricles is compatible with normal life are cases where the condition develops slowly gross surgical lesions in rat brains are known to inflict severe functional disruption but if the same damage is done bit by bit over a long period of time the dysfunction can be minimal just as the rat brains appear to cope with a stepwise reduction of available hardware so too do the human brains in some cases of hydrocephalus
265485 the vegetative state needs considerable skill to diagnose requiring assessment over a period of time
265486 patients with a referral diagnosis of the vegetative state due to acute onset brain damage were included
265487 neurologists could tell from reading terris medical records and the trial transcripts and watching that 4 1 2 hours of video the exact same evidence that judge greer used to make his decision btw that terri was not pvs thats why there are so many affidavits from doctors willing to make a sworn statement that she was not pvs based on that evidence
265488 she did not have the benefit of readily available options such as list deleted
265489 terri could speak appropriate words in context and did it repeatedly
265490 these patients were being treated elsewhere before being transferred to the unit and the diagnosis of vegetative state was made by the referring physician before the patient was admitted thus the parameters under test were not only the initial diagnoses but also attitudes about referral to specialists andrews et al collected information about the referring physicians but did not report it so we are left to wonder if those docs were or felt they were uniformly qualified to make a definitive call by themselves
265491 herein we report the first fmri maps of brain activity of two mcs patients in response to language and sensory stimulation paradigms recent observations of fragments of cerebral activity in persistent vegetative state pvs patients provide evidence that at least some partially functional cerebral regions can remain in catastrophically injured brains such remaining cerebral activity in pvs however appears isolated to small regions of the forebrain that retain limited anatomic and functional connection based on previous findings in pvs patients we hypothesized that mcs patients would fail to activate the complete cerebral network identified in normal subjects in response to similar passive listening paradigms however we rule out this hypothesis for these two patients in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the networks remain largely intact but show significant differences in their level of responsiveness
265492 robert should be allowed to die so the family can grieve
265493 based on my review of extensive medical records documenting terris care over the years on my personal observations of terri and on my observations of terris responses in the many hours of videotapes taken in 2002 she demonstrates a number of behaviors that i believe cast a reasonable doubt on the prior diagnosis of pvs
265494 in summary terri schiavo demonstrates behaviors in a variety of cognitive domains that call into question the previous neurologic deagnosis of persistent vegetative state specifically she has demonstrated behaviors that are context specific sustained and indicative of cerebral cortical processing that upon careful neurologic consideration would not be expected in a persistent vegetative state
265495 while i have not physically examined terri schiavo i have looked at her medical records covering the period from 1991 to 1999 also i have studied the videotape of terri and her mother apparently taped in 1999 or 2000
265496 based on my experience and my observations it would not be my opinion that mrs schiavo is in a coma or in a persistent vegetative state in my opinion she exhibits purposeful reaction to her environment particularly her mother her eye movements easily observed on the videotape are particularly suggestive that she recognized family members and responded it is not my opinion that these movements are merely reflexive
265497 in my opinion and judgment based on my 26 years of practice mrs schiavo has a good opportunity to show some degree of improvement
265498 i have not physically examined terri schiavo however i have studied the video clips presented at the october 2002 medical evidentiary hearing the observations that follow are all within the parameters of the profession of clinical neuropsychology and are similar to the observations that i am called upon to make regularly in the course of evaluating patients as a clinical neuropsychologist all conclusions are based on standards used in the clinical neuropsychology profession in the evaluation and treatment of patients such as theresa schiavo 6 based on my experience and my observations mrs schiavo is clearly able to respond cognitively to environmental stimulii she interacts verbally and motorically with her mother and with doctors giving verbal instructions it is clear on its face that she has brain matter for these functions but has been deprived of appropriate therapy and stimulation this is documented in the following behaviors noted in the following video segments
265499 depriving brain damaged patients of medical physical occupational recreational and speech language therapy is both neglect and abusive
265500 it is my professional opinion within a reasonable degree of clinical therapeutic certainty that mrs schiavos cognitive function and ability to communicate and otherwise interact with her environment can be greatly enhanced by the modalities mentioned
265501 while i have not physically examined terri schiavo i have looked at her medical records at mediplex covering the period from january to july of 1991 including physical therapy speech and language therapy and occupational therapy
265502 i would specifically recommend that terri be given access to a system known as an environmental control system we use such systems at the rehabilitation institute of chicago to permit patients such as terri to exercise control over their environment such as to turn their television or radio on or off change channels and to control volume such environmental controls may also permit terri to control room lighting in my opinion terri could make use of such a system if it were made available and she received training in its use i would further recommend that a yes no system be implemented and that terri be trained in its use from the beginning of her rehabilitation regimen such a system could permit terri to more effectively communicate
265503 it is my judgement based on my training and clinical experience working with patients similar to terri that she would within a reasonable degree of clinical probability be able to improve her ability to interact with her environment communicate with others and control her environment if she were given appropriate therapy and training as outlined above these recommendations in my opinion would greatly improve terris quality of life
265504 once again cranford has advocated for the death of a disabled individual
265505 minneapolis neurologist ronald cranford a family friend and regular expert witness in favor of removing food and fluids in cases like nancys said joe had been chronically depressed for some time
265506 if you had bothered to read the transcripts of the malpractice trial you would see that theresa did not like to exercise
265507 the complainant stated in that report that theresa was awake in other words she was not in coma
265508 pvs and mcs both are not comatose states by definition she could not be either one and be in a coma no one is arguing that she was in a coma this is more evidence of a lack of understanding of the medical issues involved
265509 the fact that patient has said stop in apparent response to a medical procedure being done to her
265510 uses it meaningfully to answer questions although there is no basis to conclude that she is able to answer in the affirmative this manner in any consistent reliable manner
265511 functional neuroimaging comparisons of mcs and pvs patients have not been reported as evidence for conscious awareness is always indirectly inferred from behaviour further investigations of brain function in patients rising above a vegetative level will be an important next step future additional diagnostic imaging will not alter the potential for functional recovery in chronic vegetative patients however identification of less severely brain injured patients as measured by outcome with relatively high degrees of preserved metabolic activity and focal injury patterns may allow risk stratification for rational interventions
265512 it was found that the coupling between neuronal electrical activity and regional glucose metabolism was preserved in all the minimally conscious patients but was absent in all the vegetative state patients
265513 terri did not demonstrate compelling evidence of verbalization conscious awareness or volitional behavior
265514 functional connectivity assessment showed that the observed activation of primary sensory cortex seems to subsist as an island dissociated from higher order cortices that would be necessary to produce awareness
265515 in summary a residual cortical pain processing matrix could be detected in the pvs patients in which some parts of the medial and lateral pain system were activated whereas many other parts of the complex pain related network were missing there were no signs of abnormal activation in the sense of re mapping phenomena probably due to the general structural and functional brain damage what do the results of this study imply for our understanding of pain processing in patients in the pvs obviously it has to remain hypothetical if the residual cortical activity can demonstrate that pvs patients consciously suffer painful sensations
265516 can you definitively tell the difference between a traumatic or non traumatic brain injury after the fact from the clinical evidence i e the symprotms and test results
265517 i would also point out that this misrepresentation her being in a coma is pretty much the same thing as the schindlers repeatedly exclaiming that she didnt have a heart attack without explaining that she did in fact have cardiac arrest
265518 the burden of proof here is to strongly controvert the statements of doctors who have made use of all available information
265519 a cynical view may be that the information was carefully selected and presented in such a way as to be factually correct such that a certain conclusion could be drawn without perjuring the affiant
265520 affiant did not direct the course of the taped evaluation to apply the scientific method
265521 no significant changes vocalizing when prone in p t occ will say stop to nursing during procedures to t r groups more relaxed to therapists voice touch habituation
265522 he appears not to have read the judges 2002 ruling which would have made clear that statistical analysis does not support that these events could be distinguishable from coincidence
265523 the court finds that based on the credible evidence cognitive function would manifest itself in a constant response to stimuli
265524 the court has carefully viewed the videotapes as requested by counsel and does find that these actions were neither consistent nor reproducible for instance terry schiavo appeared to have the same look on her face when dr cranford rubbed her neck dr greer testified she had a smile during his non videoed examination also mr schlinder tried several more times to have her eyes follow the mickey mouse balloon but without success also she clearly does not consistently respond to her mother the court finds that based on the credible evidence cognitive function would manifest itself in a constant response to stimuli
265525 a variety of literature demonstrates that pvs patients do respond to pain with bodily movements and or facial expressions unsurprisingly this apparent discomfort can be relieved by analgesics
265526 one showed that in many patients diagnosed as vegetative communication could be established within 6 weeks of instituting an interdisciplinary program of physical occupational and speech therapy this group was considered to have been misdiagnosed and comprised 43 of the patients in the study
265527 affiant has reviewed patients medical records for january july 1991 noting that patient had physical occupational and language therapies
265528 the use of functional imaging techniques to discern pvs from minimally conscious state mcs is still in the experimental stages especially in the case of fmri the approach at this point is to find patients in pvs and mcs and see what the imaging reveals diagnostic use seems like it may be just around the corner with certain caveats
265529 functional neuroimaging comparisons of mcs and pvs patients have not been reported
265530 neurologists could tell from reading terris medical records and the trial transcripts and watching that 4 1 2 hours of video the exact same evidence that judge greer used to make his decision btw that terri was not pvs thats why there are so many affidavits from doctors willing to make a sworn statement that she was not pvs based on that evidence
265531 would you please name the neurologists who swore affidavits after doing all of what you say theyve done
265532 a cynical view may be that the information was carefully selected and presented in such a way as to be factually correct such that a certain conclusion could be drawn without perjuring the affiant
265533 affiant did not direct the course of the taped evaluation to apply the scientific method
265534 he appears not to have read the judges 2002 ruling which would have made clear that statistical analysis does not support that these events could be distinguishable from coincidence
265535 the court finds that based on the credible evidence cognitive function would manifest itself in a constant response to stimuli
265536 dr hammesfahr testified that he felt that he was able to get terry schiavo to reproduce repeatedly to his commands however by the courts count he gave 105 commands to terry schiavo and at his direction mrs schindler gave an additional 6 commands again by the courts count he asked her 61 questions and mrs schindler at his direction asked her an additional 11 questions the court saw few actions that could be considered responsive to either those commands or those questions
265537 a variety of literature demonstrates that pvs patients do respond to pain with bodily movements and or facial expressions unsurprisingly this apparent discomfort can be relieved by analgesics
265538 this single occurrence is sufficient in and of itself to rule out pvs regardless of how many times it was attempted and failed and it is different from the cases described in the literature because of reasons enumerated nothing like that happened
265539 one showed that in many patients diagnosed as vegetative communication could be established within 6 weeks of instituting an interdisciplinary program of physical occupational and speech therapy this group was considered to have been misdiagnosed and comprised 43 of the patients in the study
265540 reproducible but inconsistent evidence of perception communication ability or purposeful motor activity
265541 from none to unreliable and inconsistent yes no responses verbalization and gesture
265542 b assessment of responses complexity vs consistency even when the distinctions between vs and mcs as defined here are clarified the assessment of whether a patient with inconsistent or ambiguous responses fits the criteria for mcs can be difficult cognitive awareness or conscious intent may be difficult to interpret when responses are extremely inconsistent or simple there is an inverse relationship between the dimensions of complexity and consistency when judging whether behavior is evidence of consciousness when a behavior is more complex such as a verbalization fewer instances of the response are sufficient to diagnose consciousness when a behavior is less complex such as a finger movement a greater number of occurrences are necessary to establish a link to stimulus awareness or conscious intention
265543 mod ervador i thought the patients in the study were only evaluated for diagnosis of pvs twice once when the study was intitiated and once 6 weeks later after 6 weeks of therapy if they shoed cognition on the first set of tests they were considered misdiagnosed am i understanding it wrong
265544 patients received two half hour occupational therapy sessions a day for six weeks to assess responses to sensory stimulation and to identify the most reliable responses to command
265545 to avoid confusing spontaneous recovery with misdiagnosis we did not include those patients admitted within six months of their brain damage since spontaneous recovery is not uncommon during this period patients were considered to have been misdiagnosed if they could follow commands consistently within our initial assessment period of six weeks although we have previously shown in another group of our patients that recovery can occur after six months post injury none of that group showed responses within the first six weeks of admission
265546 it is disturbing to think that some patients who were aware had for several years been considered to be and treated as being vegetative
265547 you are arguing that the evidence is insufficient to disprove pvs i am arguing that it the examinations and testing were even more painfully inadequate in diagnosing pvs at all pvs by its very definition requires proof that she was never on any occasion responsive or aware we dont have that kind of proof when there is so much evidence suggesting that she was and there was never any testing using the scientific method statistical analysis or even basic accepted protocols generally used in diagnosing pvs
265548 there was never any testing or even basic accepted protocols generally used in diagnosing pvs
265549 both loss of parietal activations and alteration in strength of occipitotemporal covariation are identified with unconsciousness in vegetative patients utilizing simple auditory stimulation paradigms and functional pet in this context the observed activation of prefrontal parietal and occipital regions in our patients is suggestive of awareness but potentially consistent with other interpretations nonetheless the validity and reliability of behavioral indexes for discerning level of consciousness are also challenged by these findings that suggest functional imaging may provide evidence of cerebral integrative activity not available at the bedside these concerns amplify the need to improve diagnostic clarity in disorders of consciousness our data provide further evidence that the underlying physiology of the mcs brain is distinct from the vegetative state brain thus these findings raise important questions related to whether mcs patients have a greater capacity to experience subjective states but also to benefit from therapeutic interventions
265550 emergence from mcs is characterized by reliable and consistent demonstration of one or both of the following
265551 minimally conscious states this is the state above vegetative state where there are inconsistent responses which are above the reflex level but are not sufficient to provide evidence of awareness
265552 minimally conscious state mcs is a term which has been coined recently by the aspen consensus group on brain injury in the usa to describe people with severe brain injury who show signs which are not reflex in nature but do not occur consistently enough to be used to demonstrate awareness or to communicate
265553 a condition of severely altered consciousness in which minimal but definite behavioural evidence of self or environmental awareness is demonstrated
265554 there is a subgroup of patients with severe alteration in consciousness who do not meet diagnostic criteria for coma or the vegetative state vs these patients demonstrate inconsistent but discernible evidence of consciousness it is important to distinguish patients in mcs from those in coma and vs because preliminary findings suggest that there are meaningful differences in outcome mcs is characterized by inconsistent but clearly discernible behavioral evidence of consciousness and can be distinguished from coma and vs by documenting the presence of specific behavioral features not found in either of these conditions
265555 some patients with severe alteration in consciousness have neurologic findings that do not meet criteria for vs these patients demonstrate discernible behavioral evidence of consciousness but remain unable to reproduce this behavior consistently this condition is referred to here as the minimally conscious state mcs mcs is distinguished from vs by the partial preservation of conscious awareness this distinction is important for prognosis treatment decisions resource allocation and medicolegal judgements some studies suggest a high rate of misdiagnosis false positives and false negatives among disorders of consciousness
265556 an error that clinicians commonly make is under estimating the degree of a severely disabled patients awareness when that patients responses to stimuli are deficient indeed the mistake of diagnosing aware patients as unaware was made with disturbing frequency in three reported series of patients wrongly diagnosed as pvs when many of them in fact were aware similar errors have been re ported in children with severe congenital brain mal formations who were wrongly believed to be unaware
265557 patients in mcs may show clear signs of consciousness on one examination and then fail to produce the same behavior during a second examination conducted minutes hours or days later
265558 i would rather die from aspiration that laying on a respirator
265559 they could follow commands consistently within our initial assessment period of six weeks
265560 mod student i wish youd stop changing subjects on me i find it disrespectful
265561 fmri would definitely give more confidence in diagnosis no matter which one it happened to support if fmri show signs of language recognition as was observed in the 2005 study it would make it very difficult to support pvs diagnosis
265562 signs of language recognition as was observed in the 2005 study
265563 whether the mcs patients perceive the reversed speech as white noise or the forward speech as meaningful is unknown
265564 i think a lot of the reason people are not just sitting back and accepting the court decisions etc is simply because those types of things were not done
265565 if she had had such testing that really proved pvs or used any kind of quantifiable measurement of responses or cognition dont you think michaels lawyers would have used the results of that testing and study in the trials
265566 and released it to the public like they did with the slide of the 1996 ct scan to dispel the questions being constantly asked by the public the shcindlers and all who question the courts decision
265567 if she had had such testing that really proved pvs or used any kind of quantifiable measurement of responses or cognition dont you think michaels lawyers would have used the results of that testing and study in the trials
265568 it would draw into question as to whether or not that actually represented cognition
265569 you look at the wrong numbers only patients a and p followed first command more than 16 days after admission
265570 patients were considered to have been misdiagnosed if they could follow commands consistently within our initial assessment period of six weeks
265571 consistent responses were defined as following commands at least nine out of 10 times within a session
265572 the misdiagnosed group is down to 37 5 with assesment period is shortened from 6 weeks to 16 days
265573 the misdiagnosed group is down to 37 5 with assesment period is sic shortened from 6 weeks to 16 days
265574 patients were considered to have been misdiagnosed if they could follow commands consistently within our initial assessment period of six weeks
265575 fifteen of the 17 misdiagnosed patients showed the ability to respond to a command such as
265576 consistent responses were defined as following commands at least nine out of 10 times within a session
265577 no typos here 6 weeks is 6 weeks the authors differentiate consistent response follow commands 9 of 10 times and simply responding consistently to commands on non reflexive manner
265578 it is enough to have non reflex response to commands such as
265579 consistent response to commands puts the patients well above merely mc state into fully conscious territory
265580 patients were considered to have been misdiagnosed if they could follow commands consistently within our initial assessment period of six weeks
265581 purple addressed the difference in many of the recent posts
265582 actually the way the paper about the study was written was confusing it looks like they judged people as misdiagnosed according to the date of their first non reflexive response
265583 patients were considered to have been misdiagnosed if they showed ability to respond to a command within six weeks of admission our initial assessment period followed by consistent responses up to 43 days later
265584 although we have previously shown in another group of our patients that recovery can occur after six months post injury none of that group showed responses within the first six weeks of admission
265585 the authors differentiate consistent response follow commands 9 of 10 times and simply responding consistently to commands on non reflexive manner
265586 inconsistent responses were defined as following commands in a non reflex way fewer than nine times out of 10 within any one session consistent responses were defined as following commands at least nine out of 10 times within a session
265587 a question for those of you who supported terris death
265588 one can argue that it was poor choice of words
265589 we can go back in forth about minor details play semantic games as much as we want it will not change the fact that misdiagnosis of pvs certainly happens much more often than what can be thought of as acceptable level especially considering the consequences
265590 misdiagnosed by whom and after how much therapy and assessment
265591 if she had had such testing that really proved pvs or used any kind of quantifiable measurement of responses or cognition dont you think michaels lawyers would have used the results of that testing and study in the trials
265592 have you read the actual 2002 trial transcript in its entirety i can point you to it if youd like to it went into great detail about what testing and evaluations had and had not been done and there was nothing even remotely like that mentioned or used at all
265593 the persistent vegetative state can be defined as a vegetative state present at 1 month after acute traumatic or nontraumatic brain injury pvs can be judged to be permanent for nontraumatic injury in adults and children after 3 months
265594 the ward has been neurologically evaluated several times the most recent such evaluation by dr jeffrey karp dated september 11 1998 indicates that the ward is in a chronic vegetative state her chance of any improvement to a functional level is essentially zero dr karps opinion of the wards condition and prognosis is substantially shared among those physicians who have recently been involved in her treatment according to the wards mother mary schindler the ward exhibits certain reactions to her presence which she ascribes to some kind of low level cognitive function the same reactions have been observed by nursing home staff members who indicated that they are random and not predictably in response to any specific stimulus
265595 the diagnosis of vegetative state should be questioned when there is any degree of sustained visual pursuit consistent and reproducible visual fixation or response to threatening gestures
265596 testimony at prior evidentiary hearings did establish that patients in a persistent vegetative state like terri schiavo could utter words from time to time
265597 to be honest if there had been no evidence terri shciavo was in a pvs it wouldnt have been as disturbing but i still would have disagreed with removing her feeding tube
265598 to be honest if there had been no evidence terri schiavo was not in a pvs it wouldnt have been as disturbing but i still would have disagreed with removing her feeding tube
265599 initial laboratory data revealed cbc with wbc of 26 3 and a left shift sodium was 138 potassium 2 0 choride 91 bicarb 15 glucose 373 bun 2 and creatinine negative blood for alcohol was also negative initial arterial blood gases showed ph 7 25 pco2 34 po2 477 on 100 percent ambu bag chest x ray was negative ekg showed sinus tachycardia and non specific st t changes cat scan of the brain that was done was negative for any acute event initial eeg revealed abnormal electroencephalogram indicative of generalized suppression and slowing of the activity uniformly noted without any significant hemispheric electrolization consistent with diffuse encephalopathy serial edgs in the first few days did not show any evidence of myocardial infarction her white blood cell count did increase to 34 000 but later on decreased and became normal over the next several days pt and ptt were within normal range on initial admission platelet count was also normal total aosinophilic count was 106 within normal range urinalysis initially which was a chatheterized specimen showed wbc 7 7 rbc too numerous to count urine cultures were negative exr was 20 after potassium supplement her potassium did increase but stayed on a lower range and became normal the next day the rest of the chemistries revealed ldh 376 sgot 95 calcium 7 4 inorganic phosphorous 7 1 uric acid 8 6 albumin 2 0 and total protein 4 1 suggestive of some malnutrition total cpk did go up to 4 000 but isoenzymes were less than 2 percent serial cpk and other enzymes did not reveal evidence of myocardial infarction compliment studies were within normal range various cultures including blood and sputum were negative initially but later on the sputum culture was positive for staphylococcus aureus sensitive to amoxicillin and the patient was treated appropriately for that sputum was negative for fungus et ceteral later on the sputum on 3 22 90 was positive for enterobacter aurogenes which was also treated appropriately alkaline phosphatast isoenzymes were obtained as it remained high and was suggestive of probable liver origin other special studies included hepatitis which was negative also thyroid function tests were negative some other special studies for rening allisone and urine metanephrines all were within normal range
265600 normal blood potassium level is 3 5 to 5 5 meq liter
265601 the reference range for serum potassium level is 3 5 5 meq l with total body potassium stores of approximately 50 meq kg ie approximately 3500 meq in a 70 kg person hypokalemia is defined as a potassium level less than 3 5 meq l moderate hypokalemia is a serum level of 2 5 3 meq l severe hypokalemia is defined as a level less than 2 5 meq l
265602 her white blood cell count did increase to 34 000 but later on decreased and became normal over the next several days pt and ptt were within normal range on initial admission platelet count was also normal total aosinophilic count was 106 within normal range urinalysis initially which was a chatheterized specimen showed wbc 7 7 rbc too numerous to count urine cultures were negative exr was 20
265603 it seems strange that the 9 1 1 operator wouldnt have instructed michael to turn terri over clear her breathing passages etc
265604 just had another look at the link provided to abstract appeal within the first few paragraphs i found there greer made his findings that are based upon errors of fact there are three errors that i noted i did not write down all of the other errors in his findings 1 the evidence regarding who rang 911 he has written into his judgement that it was michael who called 911 but that is not accurate it was mr schindler snr who called 911 and then told bobby to go to the apartment
265605 medicine is all about most likelys and severe enoughs etc
265606 one does not exercise anothers right of self determination by making a decision which the state family or the public would prefer
265607 stated hope is that mr schiavo would divorce their daughter get on with his life they would be appointed guardians of terri shiavo and become her heirs at law
265608 such and such a drug does a much better job for me doc
265609 and please go look up how wbc counts of urines are written
265610 only a truly stupid person thinks the schindlers motives were anything other than the fact they wanted their daughter alive
265611 there is no other explanation for his behavior going from
265612 the day michael groupies can explain it coherently is the day i will listen to them but they cant explain it because michaels motives were so obvious from the get go
265613 its the most embarassing thing ive ever seen in my life the support of a man whose motives were so transparent who suddenly after years remembered his wife didnt want to live
265614 on february 14 1993 this amicable relationship between the parties was severed while the testimony differs on what may or may not have been promised to whom and by whom it is clear to this court that such severence was predicated upon money and the fact that mr schiavo was unwilling to evenly divide his loss of consortium award with mr and mrs schindler
265615 i just checked out hammesfahrs nomination letter it actually was addressed to a congressman from the national association of chiefs of police
265616 i didnt know what she wanted but this is what
265617 the schindlers never accused ms of being an abuser adulterer murderer before 2002
265618 in 1994 mr schiavo attempted to refuse medical treatment for an infection being experienced by his wife his urefuted testimony was that his decision was based upon medical advice mr and mrs schindler filed an action to have him removed as guardian based upon numerous allegations including abuse
265619 the court concludes that while it might be interesting to pursue the issue of trauma as it may have occurred almost twelve years ago that has nothing to do with theresa marie schiavo in 2002 and the mandate of the second district court of appeal in this cause rendered october 17 2001
265620 no one disputed the fact that ms was a loving husband during the trial in 2000
265621 since the florida supreme court does not require a pvs diagnosis before exercising the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment id like to know exactly which law purple kangaroo is refering to when she says ts couldnt have been removed from life support without such a diagnosis
265622 im the crack pot here with the pipe to my lips
265623 i seem to have too much malice in my tone
265624 what do you think was the reason for the de novo
265625 you know the one that honorable greer ignored out of his legally blind arrogance
265626 the courts should not have refused to investigate their own it was their duty to do just that in such grave matters such as torturing a human being to death for 14 days
265627 you think you folks are going to get away with it here in the good ole us of a
265628 there are thousands that are ready to file a class action lawsuit as well
265629 if a person becomes incapacitated and has not expressed their preference for medical treatment as in terris case 43 percent say the law should presume that the person wants to live even if the person is receiving food through a tube
265630 and when asked directly about terris case and told that her estranged husband michael has had a girlfriend for 10 years and has two children with her 56 percent of americans said he should have been removed as her guardian
265631 while the testimony differs on what may or may not have been promised to whom and by whom it is clear to this court that such severance was predicated upon money and the fact that mr
265632 end stage condition means an irreversible condition that is caused by injury disease or illness which has resulted in progressively severe and permanent deterioration and which to a reasonable degree of medical probability treatment of the condition would be ineffective
265633 if judge greer incorrectly dated the abuse complaint he made an error but it didnt change the outcome of the trial
265634 no one accused ms of physical abuse during the 2000 trial
265635 if thered been any real evidence of a crime her medical records wouldve been subpoenad
265636 over this last decade theresas brain deteriorated because of the lack of oxygen it suffered at the time of the heart attack by mid 1996 the cat scans of her brain showed a severely abnormal structure at this point much of her cerebral cortex is simply gone and has been replaced cerebral spinal fluid
265637 this honorable american almost whipped those that wanted to murder theresa
265638 none of judge greers errors really changed the outcom sic of the 2000 trial
265639 making personal attacks such as calling someone retarded or mentally ill because they disagree with you is inexcusable
265640 ts didnt have a potassium imbalance she had polycystic ovaries
265641 never mind the tire tracks on his face and chest the thymus gland sqeeze coefficient proves that he actually died from polysystic testicleitis
265642 being or occurring in the final stages of a terminal disease or condition
265643 to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that treatment of the irreversible condition would be medically ineffective
265644 before a surrogate can exercise an incapacitated persons right to refuse unwanted medical treatment he must be satisfied that there is no hope of recovery and that there is clear and convincing evidence of their medical preferences
265645 just because the florida legislature used those terms when writing the statute that doesnt mean the law would withstand a constitutional challenge
265646 just want dad to die so we can get all his stuff
265647 swallowing tests in 1990 1991 and 1992 the last of these tests was done at largo medical center and resulted in a finding that the liquid went nowhere thereafter and annually from 1993 through 1996 or 1997 the ward had a speech pathologist examine her and the finding was that she could not be rehabilitated in this regard and that there was a high risk of aspiration
265648 100 recovery my point was that notwithstanding the claims of the
265649 if a judge isnt capable of making a determination about what someones wishes would have been who is
265650 when the patient would be able to process it and will die without it
265651 recovery of consciousness after a nontraumatic injury is unlikely of the 169 patients with such injuries only 11 percent had recovered consciousness three months after injury 89 percent remained in a vegetative state or had died figure 1 and table 3 six months after injury only two additional patients had recovered consciousness one year after injury 15 percent of the 169 patients had recovered consciousness 32 percent were in a persistent vegetative state and 53 percent had died
265652 if the allegations had been proven true at least some of them would have amounted to abuse agreed
265653 responding evidently to terris parents visit which i missed a few days ago
265654 doctors have a sworn oath to keep their patients alive
265655 when did this country start turning toward a death culture what does that even mean whats different now from ten years ago
265656 i dont know why she would want to commit suicide
265657 one in four women with acute pelvic inflammatory disease experiences medical sequelae conversely many women with sequelae of the disease such as infertility related to tubal obstruction do not have a history of having had the symptoms or signs of an acute infection
265658 the clinical symptoms and signs of acute pelvic inflammatory disease vary considerably and are usually nonspecific importantly some patients may have very little symptomatology a condition called silent or asymptomatic pid
265659 patients with acute pelvic inflammatory disease present with a wide range of nonspecific clinical symptoms and signs thus the diagnosis of acute pelvic inflammatory disease even by experienced clinicians is imprecise many women have mild nonspecific pelvic symptoms that are overlooked by both the woman and her physician the severity of the clinical presentation of acute pid varies from being asymptomatic to a woman with diffuse peritonitis and a life threatening illness
265660 pain in the lower abdomen and pelvis is by far the most frequent symptom of acute pelvic inflammatory disease in all large series more than 90 of women present with diffuse bilateral lower abdominal pain this pain is usually described as constant and dull
265661 acute pelvic inflammatory disease often occurs with minimum symptoms most studies have found that approximately 50 of women who are infertile as a result of tubal obstruction do not remember ever having symptoms of acute pelvic infection
265662 leukocytosis is not a reliable indicator of acute pelvic inflammatory disease nor does it correlate with the need for hospitalization or the severity of tubal inflammation
265663 operative treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease has decreased markedly in the past 15 years operations are restricted to life threatening infections ruptured tuboovarian abscesses laparoscopic drainage of a pelvic abscess persistent masses in some older women for whom future childbearing is not a consideration and removal of a persistent symptomatic mass because of the techniques of in vitro fertilization every effort is made to perform conservative surgery and preserve ovarian and uterine function in women who have not completed their families
265664 it is so heartening to know that this issue is finally being laid to rest and that a good woman whose body endured 15 years of a meaningless perverse shell like existence has finally had her voice heard and her heartfelt wishes obeyed if there is an afterlife her spirit is finally happy and at peace knowing that those who loved her in life and death may finally have the chance to heal and to learn to take the sadness of parting like mature grownups have since the dawn of time to realize that death is life life death
265665 leukocytosis is not a reliable indicator of acute pelvic inflammatory disease nor does it correlate with the need for hospitalization or the severity of tubal inflammation in fact im more sure of my knowledge now than i was before
265666 i know from the human patient side the human ear and eyeball side that is factually incorrect
265667 i am the only one giving you a run for your money hear an echo in here you are like a child playing a video game
265668 as to your last statement me too wanna high five gee with your confidence you can do just about anything and you know everything dont yah meds you might be surprised more than you realize
265669 redundancy is getting boring and playing mind games is not my thing
265670 she died as a result of the fact that she couldnt feed herself
265671 she died because the florida legal system would not let her own parents feed her whether by tube or mouth
265672 i dont know which she preferred but neither do you
265673 we dont know if she would want to live like this therefore we should let her die
265674 i think that what rules out bulimia is that she did not have a heart attack as claimed by ms she did on the other hand suffer a cardiac arrest caused no doubt by the deprivation of oxygen to her brain
265675 it was noted in a deposition that terri did have a problem with her sinuses after moving to florida and sinus problems can interfere with the rythmn of ones heart
265676 also since you sound like you know what youre talking about do you realize that they are saying that terri had massive anoxic infarction of the brain on 2 25 90 and yet had a
265677 last question why would he have moved in with terris parents i see it as an act to again take away any appearance that the family were angry with him and his treatment of their daughter previously it would have been to deflect any public or newspaper opinion that things werent ok in that respect i cant see he would have moved in with them for any other reason but there he was in her parents home
265678 they tell you a lot about whats going on with someone i have examined some of her lab values the ones listed in the discharge summary
265679 if there was some information available that would lead one to conclude that foul play was involved then of course it would make sense to be a lot more concerned about the other people around her to try and figure out what happened but there apparently isnt any such information available
265680 the police officer saw no signs of a struggle or that any crime had occurred
265681 by applying the knowledge that has come from years and years of other physicians observing writing about their observations and sharing their knowledge
265682 they tell you a lot about whats going on with someone i have examined some of her lab values the ones listed in the discharge summary
265683 if there was some information available that would lead one to conclude that foul play was involved then of course it would make sense to be a lot more concerned about the other people around her to try and figure out what happened but there apparently isnt any such information available
265684 the police officer saw no signs of a struggle or that any crime had occurred
265685 by applying the knowledge that has come from years and years of other physicians observing writing about their observations and sharing their knowledge
265686 i will restate the clinical picture of a patient should hold much more weight than anything spit out by lab machinery or computer generated lab reports even your ekgs etc
265687 society may think that computers have surpassed the humans ability to reason but they forget it is the lowest paid individuals in the food chain that any institution has hired and put in front of the computers inputting the information
265688 take a day do a walk through of a laboratory be a fly on the wall look at the whole process of the specimen going in all the way to the result coming out
265689 you have worked overtime to tip toe around any possibility michael schiavo played a part in terri schiavos situation i see a reaching for explanations for conditions to explain away brain damage why not also look at the reality of the relationship of these two people also at the time she was found not breathing laying face down with a husband who as i understand it did not call 911 at least he didnt call 911 first the whole scene stinks to high heaven to me
265690 not only did i not conclude that i shouldnt believe anything in a radiologists
265691 i just have one question what caused all that damage to her brain stroke 26 year old with stroke could somebody explain if they covered that in the autopsy did they try to explain what caused all the brain damage
265692 i have a question about the cause of death thing my understanding was that thogmartin said there was no evidence for strangulation or trauma but that it couldnt be ruled out completely and neither could suffocation
265693 in general the most difficult cause of death to determine from a medical examiners point of view are deaths from strangulation or suffocation thats because these causes may not leave marks on the outside of the body in shootings stabbings baseball bat injuries deaths from automobile accidents etc there are clues on the outside of the body but with asphyxia i e a lack of oxygen getting to the body and with poisonings as well there may be no clues on the outside of the body indicating that this may be an unnatural death let alone a homicide so those are the cases that require the most careful dissections particularly of the neck organs its very important to look under the skin of the neck for small signs of trauma usually hemorrhage sometimes fractures because they can easily be missed there has to be a high index of suspicion when theres a suffocation death when a person couldnt breathe but there are no marks are left on the body
265694 in the case of drowning and suffocation the autopsy findings may not be specific and police investigation may be critical to the understanding of the death
265695 excess pressure on the vagus nerve during strangulation can cause it to send a signal to the brain ordering the heart to stop beating
265696 about the infant like scenario i know the conclusions i made about that sound very harsh but i really believe they are true
265697 it is tragic what happened to her but that doesnt change what happened to her
265698 its even more difficult to accept them when you want to believe that she could improve or that she was so close to breaking out of the illness
265699 but the microscopic examination of her brain just doesnt support the notion that it was functional
265700 neuropathologic examination alone of the decedents brain or any brain for that matter cannot prove or disprove a diagnosis of persistent vegetative state or minimally conscious state
265701 to anonymous its really hard to suffocate someone with pillows without injuring something
265702 its a significant question that during this ordeal was never brought up
265703 i have consistently said over the years that i didnt wait but ran to call 911 after terri collapsed
265704 between 40 and 70 minutes elapsed before the call was made and i am aware of no explanation for the delay
265705 in light of this new information i urge you to take a fresh look at this case without any preconceptions as to the outcome
265706 there is no hour gap or other gap to the point michael heard terri fall and called 911
265707 weve seen the baseless allegations in this case fall by the wayside one by one thats what i would call it a baseless claim to perpetuate a controversy that in fact doesnt exist
265708 anything that can shed some light on the cause of terris collapse is going to be welcomed by our family
265709 i dont want to see it on tv any more i dont want to hear politicians talk about it let her be at peace
265710 i read it on a website somewhere that just happened to reflect my narrow point of view
265711 there are many ways that there would not be evidence of strangulation especially after 15 years
265712 there are other ways of depriving someone of oxygen that are very soft the most common is someone in their sleep with a pillow over their face
265713 subtle trauma related to commotio cordis or nontraumatic asphyxia is also possible but no evidence of these exists
265714 in 8 of these 18 cases relatively modest chest blows caused death emphasis mine when an adult struck either a child as part of parent child discipline ages 3 months to 11 years or an adult struck anouther adult in gang related rituals seven of these 8 cases triggered a homicide investigation with charges of first degree murder 1 prosecutor sought the death penalty each perpetrator was convicted of murder manslaughter or reckless homicide
265715 the autopsy results confirmed his opinion that the frontal areas of the brain the areas that deal with awareness and cognition were relatively intact
265716 the spect scan confirmed these areas were functional and not scar tissue and that was apparently also confirmed on dr stephen nelsons review of the slides
265717 obviously the pathologists comments that she could not see were not borne out by reality and thus his assessment must represent sampling error the videotapes clearly showed her seeing
265718 ultimately based on the clinical evidence and the autopsy results an aware woman was killed
265719 and connecting the dots finding the simplest explanation that accounts for each finding and that provides a common underlying cause for the symptoms and sequelae
265720 he did rule out bulimia and heart attack and found severe osteoporosis as well as heterotopic ossification he also provides a pretty thorough review of the bone scan findings
265721 she had left him previously due to abuse and went to live with her parents
265722 have you ever read about this abuse somewhere other than a website that is obviously biased on the schindlers side
265723 there certainly is an argument that she couldnt have been strangled without some evidence and im making it i have presented reasons to you for why i disagree with your statement that he could suffocate her and leave no marks whatsoever you havent addressed those reasons at all unless you somehow persuade me that your position is correct im not going to believe it just saying the same thing over and over again is not persuasive how exactly would he have done that in what way could he have sealed of her airway without causing injury to the very susceptible oral mucosa dont just say he could have explain how
265724 the cerebellum is mostly supplied by the vertebral arteries and she had anoxic injury to the cerebellum so more than likely her vertebral arteries were also not delivering enough blood to the brain and that isnt due to the compression of the carotids
265725 the reflex youre alluding to relating the carotids with heart rate is called the carotid sinus reflex there are receptors in the carotid sinus that respond to the pressure in the carotid artery and serve to maintain a constant blood pressure if something greatly increases the pressure in the carotid artery it would send signals to slow the heart rate however it seems to me that this elevated pressure due to carotid compression would be transient because if the blood flow to the carotids is actually sealed off there would be very little new blood entering the carotid sinus at the same time the arterial pressure in the head would be dropping due to less blood flow which would draw any high pressure blood in the carotid sinus into the skull thereby decreasing the pressure in the carotid sinus and actually increasing the heart rate
265726 as far as releasing clots from the carotid is concerned it is very very unlikely that this happened in her case
265727 and concerning the positional suffocation ideas i do recall from prior reading that the person usually has to be predisposed somehow
265728 petechiae of the face sclerae and conjuctivae were virtually always absent petechiae of the epicardium or pleural surfaces of the lung were sometimes present but these are so nonspecific that the authors do not give any weight to them if the bag is removed prior to notification of the authorities a medical examiner cannot determine the cause of death by the autopsy
265729 in the elderly there may be congestion of the face with scattered fine petechiae of the sclerae conjunctivae and skin of the face this has not been the case in young individuals in whom petechiae are usually absent it is the discovery of the gag obstructing the airways that makes the diagnosis not alleged signs of asphyxia
265730 there are usually no marks on the face the face is not congested and there are no petechiae of the sclerae or conjunctigvae abrasion injuries of the face will occur only if the victim puts up a vigorous resistance
265731 burking a combination of suffocation and traumatic asphyxia burke knelt or sat on their chests expelling the air and interfering with inspiratory efforts he then put one hand over the victims nose and mouth and used the other hand to press the lower jaw towards the upper visible injuries were virtually nonexistent
265732 at autopsy there is no anatomical cause for the death though minor injuries e g abrasions may all caps are my emphasis be present in the cases involving the police toxicologic testing will usually reveal drugs t he lapse into unresponsiveness and development of cardiopulmonary arrest almost invariably occurs after the struggle has ended
265733 most not all deaths are caused by the combined effects of the physiological consequences of violent physical activity and the effects of the drugs during high intensity e g a struggle there is release of catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine from the adrenals into the circulation the effects of these substances are to increase the rate and force of contraction of the heart the conduction velocity and the blood pressure this results in an increase in demand for oxygen by the heart the highest levels of catecholamines occur not during physical activity a struggle in this case but approximately 3 min after cessation of the activity
265734 during the struggle not only do the levels of the catecholamines increase in the blood but so do blood potassium concentrations the increase may be as much as 5 meq l or more in some individuals following cessation of exercise there is an immediate rapid drop in blood potassium to concentrations that approach 2 meq l five minutes after cessation of the exercise potassium levels may be lower than when they were at rest there may be a pronged hypokalemia lasting 90 miin or more these extremes in potassium concentrations can have cardiac arrhythmogenic effects the arrhythmogenic effects of the hyperkalemia however are neutralized by the cardioprotective effect of the elevated levels of catecholomines thus the danger time for arrhythmias is immediately following cessation of physical activity when blood catecholamine concentrations continue to rise while potassium levels p 500 drop dramatically to hypokalemic levels this period has been referred to by dimsdale et al as the time of post exercise peril in that there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias during this period
265735 during the time of post exercise peril s timulants such as cocaine etc can cause excited delirium if the individual has taken amphetamine cocaine or another stimulant the physiologic effects of the struggle can be magnified by the drugs and a fatal arrhythmia more readily ensue
265736 her tea drinking habits may also have played a role and she may have consumed as much as 1 gram of caffeine per day caffeine was not tested for in the hospital toxicology caffeine has been somewhat associated with cardiac arrhythmias and hypokalemia however considering her activities on the night prior to her collapse and the time of her collapse caffeine toxicity is unlikely unless some sort of pill or supplement containing caffeine was consumed
265737 while virtually all deaths in manic delirium are probably caused by the physiological reactions to a violent struggle with or without interaction with drugs in occasional cases positional asphyxia may play a role in a death
265738 the difference between homicide and murder should be carefully explained
265739 even if it means they have to twist and manipulate and ignore the legal and medical records
265740 im wondering though if some of you docs might answer a couple of questions for me
265741 during the time of post exercise peril s timulants such as cocaine etc can cause excited delirium
265742 bones are stressed whenever you place weight on them when you take away those stressors by becoming bedridden for example the skeleton loses the signal that guides its remodeling the reabsorption regrowth of bone continues but is no longer guided by the stress that assure correct bone growth the new growth is insufficient and osteoporosis develops
265743 someone would have heard such a struggle if it took place
265744 that level of activity the kind detailed above is more of flat out running a mile or more or a life and death struggle level of physical activity thrashing kicking bucking and twisting trying to scratch the kind of reaction one would expect from a concious able bodied 26 year old female fighting for her life
265745 oh lets not forget the latest claim of the schindlers that michael waited 40 70 or even as long as 120 minutes before he called the medics
265746 and still the medics found her in ventricular fibrillation thats quite an accomplishment for a normal cardiac muscle nothing extraordinary there at all
265747 t he lapse into unresponsiveness and development of cardiopulmonary arrest almost invariably occurs after the struggle has ended
265748 thus the danger time for arrhythmias is immediately following cessation of physical activity when blood catecholamine concentrations continue to rise while potassium levels drop dramatically to hypokalemic levels this period has been referred to by dimsdale et al as the time of post exercise peril in that there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias during this period
265749 the highest levels of catecholamines occur not during physical activity but approximately 3 min after cessation of the activity
265750 five minutes after cessation of the exercise potassium levels may be lower than when they were at rest there may be a pronged hypokalemia lasting 90 miin or more
265751 or maybe the killer strangles her on the bed because it is already cushioned then quietly drags her body out and down the hall to the bathroom door where he leaves her face down and with her legs inside the bathroom or maybe the killer strangled her on the couch no matter
265752 subtle trauma related to commotio cordis or nontraumatic asphyxia is also possible but no evidence of these exists
265753 in 8 of these 18 cases relatively modest chest blows caused death when an adult struck either a child as part of parent child discipline ages 3 months to 11 years or an adult struck another adult in gang related rituals seven of these 8 cases triggered a homicide investigation with charges of first degree murder 1 prosecutor sought the death penalty each perpetrator was convicted of murder manslaughter or reckless homicide
265754 seems much more plausible to me than the idea that she collapsed from an arrhythmia induced by bulimic hypokalemia
265755 it appears that she received approximately 1250cc of fluid in the field and or at least by the time she was being worked up in the hospital she had also received epinephrine and had suffered a periods of ventricular fibrillation all of which are known to cause factitious changes in blood electrolytes and other substances
265756 factitious potassium levels as low as 2 0 mmol l have been reported and average decreases of 0 8 mmol l have been documented experimentally potassium reductions of as much as 2 mmoll have been reported the dosage of epinephrine she received was sufficient to cause such factitious lowering of potassium
265757 revealed patients with measured antemortem post resuscitation potassium levels as low as 2 6 mmol l with various causes of death
265758 the most significant other blood values were decreases in her hemoglobin hematocrit urea nitrogen albumin total protein globulin and calcium dilution of her blood proteins and electrolytes from excessive fluid consumption is possible and many of her low blood values may reflect the large fluid bolus she received during resuscitation such anomalies have been described in patients in similar clinical settings therefore these values are unlikely to be clues to the etiology of her initial insult although in the malpractice proceedings the low protein values were suggested as indicators of malnutrition this is unlikely and not generally characteristic of bulimia nervosa
265759 strangulation is no more or less true or correct than the hypokalemia bulimia theory or any other theory out there to explain why she collapsed we will never know what truly happened that morning
265760 as he very eloquently states in the well reasoned autopsy report neither theory trauma vs bulimia is refuted or backed up by the findings
265761 the coroner has a sworn duty as part of his office to be objective and make sure that justice is served

265768 most likely the 9 femoral periosteal reaction reflects a response to a 10 subperiosteal hemorrhage
265769 and the activity 17 in l1 correlates perfectly with the compression 18 fracture which is presumably traumatic
265770 the 10 presumption is that the other multiple areas of 11 abnormal activity also relate to previous trauma

265795 to quote abraham lincoln to old to cry to hurt to laugh at this point in time
265796 the decision of the board is the result solely of the facts discovered in this investigation i want to reiterate there was no pressure from outside influences

265799 i just had to try and stay tough and not give up
265800 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
265801 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene
265802 the choice is clear most of all we can choose between hope and fear it is going to be very difficult for republicans to run on their stewardship of the economy or their outstanding foreign policy we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
265803 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
265804 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
265805 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
265806 not only did we play the race card we dealt it from the bottom of the deck
265807 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
265808 while we were watching he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stared at us and dropped the head right in front of us
265809 there was no rage in him and he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
265810 he was taunting police with the head in his hand out the window
265811 at this time im not aware of what may have provoked this attack
265812 i can confirm the victim was stabbed and that the victim was pronounced dead at the scene
265813 this is one of the most horrific crimes i have ever heard in my life

265815 a popular topic for discussion on arabic tv channels is the best strategy for conquering the west
265816 in muslim tradition the world is divided into dar al islam where muslims rule and dar al harb the field of war where the infidels live
265817 in the last century some christians justified the persecution and mass murder of jews by claiming that jews wanted to take over the world
265818 at least though the left in the netherlands has seen that there is a clash between liberal democracy and cultural relativism that some cultures are simply not compatible with western traditions of freedom and tolerance and that the old distinction between evil right wingers and cuddly left wingers no longer makes sense
265819 just as communism could only be upheld by totalitarianism so multiculturalism is being upheld by curbs on free speech and democracy
265820 even in supposedly christian europe christianity has become the most mocked religion its followers treated with public suspicion and derision and sometimes such as the would be eu commissioner rocco buttiglione hounded out of political office
265821 i have spoken to dozens of former muslims who have converted to christianity in britain and who are shunned by their community subjected to mob violence forced out of town threatened with death and even kidnapped
265822 no the real answer to why britain spawned people fuelled with maniacal hate for their country is that britain hates itself
265823 only in the last few years has it dawned on the government how dangerous the lefts war on britishness really is
265824 livingstone also has how shall we put this controversial views on relations with muslim extremists his notorious embrace of the qatar based anti semitic homophobic totalitarian islamic extremist imam yusuf al qaradawi spiritual guide of the muslim brotherhood has
265825 no its lefties we should be furrowing our collective brow about
265826 the left was definitely right on basic moral issues particularly on promoting tolerance whether it be gay rights womens rights or combating racism
265827 whether it is market forces in public services or multiculturalism the left first successfully demonises right wing policies and then when its own ideas fail it adopts them without apology
265828 universities are pretty much monopolised by the left and seem to rejoice in their lack of real world impact
265829 in the us the flourishing centre right think tanks have helped push the whole political centre of gravity way to the right of that of the uk
265830 the london magazine time out recently interviewed a turkish immigrant who said that the english were now the foreigners in stoke newington

265832 the turning point was the murder of a policeman during a raid on a north african islamic

265834 islamic radicals like hitler cultivate support by nurturing grievances against others
265835 rather than tackling intolerance it political correctness now promotes intolerance brooking no criticism and denouncing any critics

265837 the sheikh has used his influential sermons to promote suicide bombing by palestinians in israel
265838 compare and contrast 2 a christmas trees and decorations are banned in saudi arabia b christmas trees and decorations are banned in britains jobcentres the extremes that other religions go to preserve their cultural heritage is only matched in christianity by its extreme death wish
265839 once christmas has been supplanted by a spiritually vacuous post christian orgy of consumption the next phase of the war is to ban it altogether
265840 no the real christophobes are the self loathing guilt ridden politically correct liberal elite driven by anti christian bigotry and a ruthless determination to destroy their own heritage and replace it with
265841 the liberal left need to ask themselves what they hope to achieve by giving such uncritical support to islamic extremism
265842 but winning arguments with reason rather than rabid denunciation is
265843 one of the most powerful psychological foundations of political correctness is liberal guilt
265844 the wests refusal to confront contemporary islamic slavery is a reflection of the inability of pc thinking to engage a non pc reality
265845 many of the politically correct left including the guardian the independent most of the bbc have chosen to champion those who are deliberately trying to murder innocent civilians
265846 many on the left in britain supported the ayatollah of irans call to murder salman rushdie for insulting islam
265847 after a few days the coverage of the terrorist attack was obliterated by saturation coverage of the accidental police killing the reason was simply that the terrorist attacks although a far more important story didnt fit the politically correct agenda
265848 the rise of political correctness represents an assault on both
265849 a country that has long prided itself on its freedom of speech has been reduced by political correctness to a country where despite endemic levels of violent crime police spend time investigating and arresting leading writers and broadcasters for what they write and

265873 as a result of our connecting neighbors website weve become more involved in the community and have gone from selling two homes in the cove in 2006 to selling 10 in 2007 we are now the dominant agents in our community and plan for this growth to continue
265874 i have taken nine listings in the past 13 months as a direct result of my site several of these listings were for over 1 million
265875 we really feel like our community website gives us an edge over our competition and has tremendous potential to help our business grow exponentially
265876 watching other communities take action in california inspired us to start our own program and with electricity bills skyrocketing and the future of tax credits and rebates questionable switching to clean affordable solar power seemed obvious
265877 but more importantly it feels like we are making a difference by purchasing energy that uses the sun which we have plenty of here in livermore and encouraging development of future renewable energy sources
265878 by bringing a community together to go solar we can educate homeowners one neighborhood at a time and provide them with an extra financial incentive to switch to clean renewable energy
265879 we are committed to helping city and community programs like livermores reach their solar goals and are excited to replicate the success of this program in neighboring pleasanton

265909 for more than a year we have been privileged to represent dr bruce ivins during the investigation of the anthrax deaths of september and october of 2001
265910 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
265911 a quiet man he was always very helpful and pleasant
265912 in retrospect although my concern for biosafety was honest and my desire to refrain from crying wolf was sincere i should have notified my supervisor ahead of time of my worries about a possible breach in biocontainment
265913 i thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible anthrax contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute
265914 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it

265917 these incidents of pml are unfortunate and disappointing and we hope for the best possible outcomes for these individuals and their families

265920 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation
265921 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
265922 over the 9 month period of weekly sessions it became clear that the participants attending the discussion group remained the same throughout the group who received treatment as usual showed a small decline over the assessment period yet those having regular hypnosis sessions showed real improvement across all of the areas that we looked at
265923 participants who are aware of the onset of dementia may become depressed and anxious at their gradual loss of cognitive ability and so hypnosis which is a tool for relaxation can really help the mind concentrate on positive activity like socialization
265924 back to school is a common trigger for childhood constipation

265926 parents can help address this withholding behavior and avoid constipation by taking a proactive approach
265927 this includes encouraging your child to drink plenty of water offering high fiber foods such as whole grains fruits and vegetables and setting up a regular toilet routine especially after meals if your child does suffer from constipation over the counter medicine like oral and rectal laxative options for children can help parents successfully treat the issue
265928 the results of the survey confirm that many children are not comfortable going to the bathroom at school
265929 while its difficult to change the way kids feel about school bathrooms parents can help them by being mindful of this issue and making good bathroom habits a priority at home
265930 abbie is fed up with ryan constantly trying to cover up their relationship
265931 two months ago he finally agreed to make a public appearance with her but she had to fight just to do that
265932 abbies been very understanding and has played along with ryans secrecy for nearly two years but now shes lost her patience and its causing a lot of tension and arguing
265933 i dont think people are of the understanding that this type of conduct is a crime
265934 you look over someones shoulder and read a personal letter and thats not a crime so how can it be a crime to access someones e mail
265935 what youre dong when youre accessing e mail is affirmatively exceeding your access to electronic documents and systems
265936 usually youre doing that by pretending to be that person to break into their account
265937 for a co worker to snoop that would take some work but for a sys admin to do it thats trivial
265938 thats where abuses are more likely if someone was caught doing it id generally expect a pretty ugly situation
265939 but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release
265940 that to me is freedom to allow for those who prefer open formats the ability to deliver their content without any barriers between them and their end users
265941 its such an obvious improvement over the previous state of affairs of dealing with online video that it really makes you wonder why it took so long
265942 were several years into the online video revolution now led by such giants as youtube so its only fair that we finally get native browser support for videos
265943 we are at a unique point in our history where we have the eyes of the world focused on our company and tracking our performance we are redoubling our commitment to driving sustained profitable growth for our stockholders the value inherent in yahoo

265946 at some level a paean of praise to the fortitude and moral courage that has been shown by george w bush in this time of terror and war

265951 poverty and necessity drive you into one of two places
265952 one is despair and the other is to fight and be self sufficient i was in a hurry i didnt want to be waiting in a queue

265954 when a network buys a primetime show they pay the cost of production

265963 lanza did a quick rewrite to use an open source codec and now windrm and fdmdv are back
265964 drmdv an intermediate program between the other two has been abandoned windrm could always use the open source speex codec but fdmdv users will need to download the new version
265965 the result has been surprisingly high quality audio with virtually no noise sort of like listening to fm but in the narrow bandwidth of a sideband signal windrm the best sounding program uses 2 5 khz of spectrum fdmdv sounds a little rougher but uses only 1 1 khz of spectrum they both use ofdm modulation a set of close spaced carriers that are each modulated with a little bit of data to add up to the final digital signal the main problem with hf digital voice is that it needs fairly strong signals fdmdv works better with weaker signals than windrm
265966 melp or mixed excitation linear prediction was designed specifically for high quality low data rate voice communication so the on air audio might suffer some with the new version digital voice users have been waiting and hoping for someone to concentrate on developing a codec optimized for ham radio use but none has been forthcoming
265967 our mission was to support the txmf and the soc with hf communications by expanding the normal net schedule and establishing a full time liaison
265968 in addition requests were sent to the other mars services in the region asking for liaison stations to participate in the army nets fortunately a hurricane exercise had been completed a week before and the exercise operations order was used to execute this mission we reacted to the storm the same way we trained for the emergency
265969 winlink is the perfect tool for this sort of thing
265970 you can send messages and get them when you have time the system works very well even without the internet
265971 even at that there were times when communications were out due to winds or flooding volunteers in mars and the amateur radio community provided what was needed to get through the storm and are standing by for any after effects
265972 never events cause serious injury or death to beneficiaries and result in unnecessary costs to medicare and medicaid due to the need to treat the consequences of the errors
265973 the steps taken today reflect our strong conviction that these events in fact should be prevented and our commitment to protecting medicare and medicaid patients from them
265974 while it may be some time before we can begin to assess the real impact of these steps on patient care we are hearing from hospitals around the country about efforts they have undertaken in the past year to improve staff training and other measures to reduce the incidence of these preventable conditions
265975 and other payers both public and private are beginning to adopt similar policies in their payment systems this is a win win situation better outcomes at less overall cost

265977 it is the responsibility of the people to vote the congress out of office for good we need action not talk
265978 we are giving our wealth to the middle east because we refuse to provide our own energy why because our congress represents the corporate state and not the people
265979 in fact every new promise that the new members of congress ran on to get elected remains exactly that an empty promise i have to laugh when i recall the self righteous finger waving of house speaker nancy pelosi and company now go on and enjoy your vacation you earned it
265980 we have all been wringing our hands about energy and our dependence on foreign oil for the past 30 years
265981 and we wonder why the public is cynical and the wrong track numbers are at an all time high
265982 members of congress and in this example i mean the majority have refused to take any action because it is easier to wait out the presidential election and then see what the climate is like because unfortunately for the people congress can choose to vote only when it is convenient to do so
265983 because there is nothing they can do for immediate energy prices and they have profound differences for the long term that are not easily reconcilable
265984 right now the publics anger at washington is mainly being taken out on the party of the president
265985 and its not likely that is going in change due to congresss failure to act during the august recess
265986 allowing offshore drilling will have no impact on gas prices its a drop in the bucket
265987 but the idea that this is a conspiracy by the big oil companies is wrong as well
265988 well its been in the works for a long time
265989 ive been excited but weve been in negotiations for a while im just finally glad we got it done im just relieved
265990 my mind is made up and there are no facts that you could possibly present that could sway me so cease your incessant babble you pompous blowhard

265992 it is appropriate at this time that the company fully explore all alternatives to ensure that the best possible return to shareholders are achieved
265993 with the majority of our assets in russia we feel very comfortable in having a major russian group as our strategic investor
265994 this financing will allow us to aggressively advance the prognoz silver project complete our mine developments finance our exploration programmes and move ahead on other exciting new possibilities for high river including new acquisitions
265995 high river has been successful in accumulating an impressive portfolio of precious metal assets both in production and in the advanced exploration phase
265996 the recent announcement by high river of the agreement to acquire the remaining 50 per cent interest in the prognoz silver project is a very important development as it will provide the company with a high profile project that with the funding in place can be aggressively moved towards development and turn the company into a major silver producer
265997 both of these projects appear to have various advantages in terms of quality and proximity to market that could make them very attractive ventures

266011 a new poll from the pew research center for the people amp the press shows the american public increasingly concerned about rising energy and food costs the national survey conducted july 23 27 among 1 503 adults shows sen barack obama d il did not gain significantly from his trip to the middle east and europe last week the survey indicates voters are split on which candidate is better on foreign policy 43 percent listed mccain while 42 percent named obama 48 percent of voters still view sen john mccain r az as more capable than obama of defending the country against a terrorist attack but that lead has narrowed in the last month in june 55 percent selected mccain as better on terrorism on iraq mccain has a slim 44 percent lead over obamas 41 percent

266035 that said theres one place where the sports assholes come out in droves and it drives me batshit insane every freaking time i see it its a land where youll see asshole stupidus in its natural environment taking a gigantic dump on women and human decency its the land of the deadspin commenters
266036 in retrospect obviously the tire was obviously not good enough
266037 there have been times this year when the tire hasnt been what we wanted we all remember atlanta and of course indy but i think they also deserve some credit this car is a completely different animal and for the most part this year tires havent been by far for the most part the issue it certainly wasnt what anybody wanted it wasnt what goodyear wanted
266038 when they do that whats going to happen is the complaints are going to start coming about the grip level of the tire
266039 thats what we had at charlotte thats what we had at atlanta the last race at atlanta where everybody complained so loudly about the tire was the first time we havent had a tire problem at atlanta in a long time if you ask me if theyre going to err id rather they err on the side of the car driving bad then erring on the side of wearing them out
266040 the technology that goodyear has access to and the technology that goodyear needs to develop needs to be more concentrated in my opinion on what they can do from a simulation standpoint from an away from the race track standpoint because you can get so much more done there
266041 the test procedure that they have im not opposed to because ive seen it work
266042 but when you have a test and they bring three or four sets of tires thats really all you have to pick from if none of those work then you dont have a solution so finding a way to build the tires correctly before they ever come to a test to me thats where the technology needs to be invested and thats more important than the actual testing itself as seen by me
266043 i think multiple tires the negatives far outweigh the positives i believe that for racing to be as good as it can be that every team should have access to the same tire i dont think having different tires i dont think in any form or fashion does that make the racing better if the race turns into a battle of tires how does that make better racing i dont think it does at all
266044 i dont believe that dueling tire manufacturers is in the best interest of what we try to do here as a sport
266045 what we try to do here as a sport is to put on the best races for the fans its not about trying to build the most technology the process is to put the best race on for the fans so in our type of racing a two tire manufacturer situation is in my opinion is mostly a negative
266046 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the u s open you have no idea
266047 he actually couldnt believe that ive been playing this long with this injury you can imagine that i was not very thrilled to hear that my medical team did not see this tear in my shoulder back in april
266048 the good news is that it didnt get much worse since april but we could have started the healing time back then instead of now
266049 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
266050 once im healthy im sure ill look at this as a blessing in disguise
266051 right now its a bit painful of course but every athlete goes through these patches and im just grateful that this isnt as bad as it could have been
266052 offensively were tuning some things up weve got two more games before the real deal starts
266053 and kobe takes on the challenge of guarding their best perimeter player regardless of who it is regardless if hes a point guard 2 3 4 whatever it is
266054 he had a great game against us a few years ago the u s a and was real brash about it
266055 i knew prior to it and they reminded me of it so sic the doberman on him
266056 i think it started with dwight early in the game he got it going on the defensive end which led over to the offensive end once he holds it down in the middle like that we feed off of that
266057 kobe locked him up he got a couple of open shots throughout the course of the game but when kobe was on him i dont think he scored
266058 i think he was actually a little tentative to shoot the ball when kobe was on him
266059 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
266060 but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
266061 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
266062 i dont anticipate this having any lingering effect on this team
266063 we were talked to and things were squashed thats it thats the way it is it happened there will be no retaliation by anybody on anything when you look at the schedule we dont play the panthers this year so we need to be smart when were out there
266064 obviously everybody is going to be waiting to see what the repercussions are from this event
266065 im just praying that we rally together as a team because obviously theres going to be some adversity here the focus is not where it needs to be right now
266066 im hoping we can all come together as a team as a family and are able to put this behind us
266067 i know that fear is a powerful motivator but this drumbeat of catastrophe has made it harder to discuss the sensible concerns raised during public meetings

266081 we werent allowed to check in any bags the plane was overbooked and overloaded
266082 we were given five minutes to run to a nearby store buy two standard sized carry on bags and stuff whatever we could inside
266083 i once watched a woman carry on a piece of antique furniture in addition to her carry on luggage and purse
266084 its the gate agents job to check out the amount of luggage passengers are carrying on and the flight attendants job to find places for one piece per passenger the former will become increasingly difficult
266085 as a small short woman its hard for me to lift my bag into the overhead bin and its my responsibility not my seatmates or the flight attendants to do this
266086 and let go of the idea of packing a different outfit for each day
266087 two pairs of dark pants plus one jacket plus four tops will last for a week for two or more weeks i just plan to do some laundry
266088 i dont think ive checked a bag in more than 30 years
266089 they triple the weight of the bag reduce its usable packing space by about a third and are more prone to various types of breakage and outside of airport and hotel corridors they dont even work very well
266090 i prefer light hard sided carry on bags like the ones made by rimowa they arent the biggest ones out there but they have plenty of open space are durable and look great at the airport
266091 people think because theyre soft sided theyll be able to shove them overhead
266092 dont go for the biggest suitcase in the store the more room you have the more youll over pack and in the end youll end up paying overweight fees fifteen dollars per bag is one thing but an extra 100 or more for being overweight thats when the costs get excessive
266093 i leave mini versions of my favourite shampoo and conditioner poured into tiny bottles in my suitcase full time so i never forget them
266094 everything i want to take has to fit into a soft weekender style bag so that i can carry it myself and walk for miles if necessary
266095 my suitcase is very malleable and roomy but ive also been known to ship boxes home from a parisian post office
266096 when units sent to the south were losing 30 of their men through desertion desertion rates in helmand are now only 7 about half of all soldiers re enlist they are better equipped too with body armour m 16 assault rifles and the latest model of humvee armoured vehicle
266097 there is zero trust in the government but the ana afghan national army is our only hope they behave well with the people and are stronger than the taliban
266098 we will see a number of failures as there are quite a lot of weak carriers that will not survive we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
266099 its a positive thing if some of these carriers go out of business as it will take capacity out of the market look at alitalia it should not be allowed to continue in business it is propped up by the illegal state aid from the italians
266100 it will never go horrendously wrong when youre offering the cheapest fares in europe all weve got to do is keep flying more aircraft opening up more routes and offering people more cheap flights
266101 our traffic will grow by 17 per cent from 51 million to 58 million passengers precisely for the reason that our profits will fall we have guaranteed no fuel surcharges on ryanair whatever oil price increases there are
266102 we are the perfect airline for the recession you dont want to waste any money at the moment on overpriced flights that will be delayed out of heathrow while your bags are lost
266103 i havent scored the runs so far this season in test cricket so of course i felt under pressure
266104 not so much pressure from outside but pressure knowing that i havent contributed and i felt as though i have let the team down that is how i have felt these last few months so today was very special
266105 vaughany said before i went out dont be reckless but be aggressive when i am taking the bowlers on that is when i am at my best

266108 fortinet is at the leading edge of security virtualization functionality

266113 you cant incarcerate people who have not been charged with a crime
266114 if you were to look at your trash can and the volume of waste that is in there more than half is in empty plastic
266115 the number represents where it is in the chain of plastic and one is virgin and 1 is easiest to recycle
266116 we are really excited about taking the one through five and seven
266117 there is still a lot of plastic that doesnt have numbers on it and most of those are 6s
266118 and my ways are far beyond anything you could imagine
266119 hes spoken to me about it and is huge on getting full backs forward he wants me outside and wants me attacking
266120 in one on one talks hes made it clear his full backs are very important to him he wants the same as gigi de canio but hopefully we can be a bit more organised when we need to defend
266121 at hull it was a different scenario where the emphasis wasnt really on that i knew that quality was always in me and i think i can show it again this year
266122 i knew i had the ability a lot depends on the way the team plays and gigi wanted that free flowing football with overlapping full backs and that suited me fortunately the new gaffer wants that too
266123 there were a lot of positives to take from the game

266183 apakah saya kecewa dengan keputusan lampard yang akhirnya memilih bertahan di chelsea tidak sama sekali saya lihat dia sangat serius dan fokus
266184 dia sebenarnya benar benar ingin meninggalkan chelsea saya yakin akan hal itu meski dia sempat mendapat masalah tapi faktanya dia batal pindah ke inter lebih karena masalah keluarga
266185 dia ingin tetap di london demi bisa menunggui dan menjaga ayahnya dan keluarganya dia sangat depat dengan ayahnya maka dia tak bisa berpisah dengan ayahnya

266190 clearly the company got its fingers burned with both the general release of 5 0 and the release candidate of 5 1 and is nervous about repeating its mistakes the fact that mysql felt the need to publicly ask the question would suggest that either it is not confident the bug reporting process has done its job or it is being overly cautious
266191 thats precisely why we ask people to just bang on it when its in the rc release candidate stage
266192 i actually think right now there are no known what we call priority one or priority two bugs that have been reported by customers that are unfixed
266193 actually 5 1 has been an ambitious project to support several new enterprise class features considering that these are very complex features it definitely requires considerable development efforts and testing especially if they are to be support for large and complex environments

266198 there are british passport holders who live in the u k who are being found in places like kandahar
266199 while my troops have not actually found british passports on enemy dead there has been a suspicion that with the high number of taliban casualties they have needed to recruit a lot of foreign fighters and some of these are likely to be of british muslim descent
266200 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk
266201 this is something the military understands but the british public does not
266202 there are very small numbers of british citizens traveling out there being trained up and then returning to the uk

266221 since the end of the cold war the world has spent more than 10 trillion on armaments the untied states alone spends approximately 100 million every day to keep its nuclear arsenal at the ready
266222 while this amount may seem large it pales in comparison to the estimated 100 billion spent each year on bottled water
266223 there is no question that clean affordable drinking water is essential to the health of our global community
266224 but bottled water is not the answer in the developed world nor does it solve problems for the 1 1 billion people who lack a secure water supply improving and expanding existing water treatment and sanitation systems is more likely to provide safe and sustainable sources of water over the long term
266225 even in areas where tap water is safe to drink demand for bottled water is increasing producing unnecessary garbage and consuming vast quantities of energy
266226 although in the industrial world bottled water is often no healthier than tap water it can cost up to 10 000 times more
266227 making bottles to meet americans demand for bottled water requires more than 1 5 million barrels of oil annually enough to fuel some 100 000 u s cars for a year
266228 u s citizens should be aware of the risk posed by the deteriorating security situation in mexico and along the border
266229 violent criminal activity including murder and kidnapping in mexico has increased
266230 how is it that a kidnapping in a feign country of a feign national gets investigated and resolved by american law enforcement while other not so connected americans who are currently being held for ransom some who are believed to have been kidnapped from american soil and taken to a feign country and held for ransom while still other americans have been executed murdered wounded and held for ransom in mexico with no apparent u s law enforcement investigation or follow up how can that be
266231 suffer from lack of funds and training and the judicial system is weak overworked and inefficient
266232 i worry that the inability of local law enforcement to come to grips with rising drug warfare kidnappings and random street violence will have a chilling effect on the cross border exchange tourism and commerce so vital to the regions prosperity
266233 statistics vary among watchdog groups but they agree that mexico has surpassed colombia a country plagued by decades of guerrilla and drug violence in the number of journalists killed each year
266234 many mexican reporters particularly in the embattled border states have stopped writing about organized crime and as the drug war spreads south journalists across the country are becoming targets on may 3 world press freedom day the decapitated body of a local drug dealer turned up outside a newspaper in the eastern port city of veracruz according to local press reports the killers left this warning for milo youll all pay you know it and more heads of damned reporters are going to roll the threat was presumed to be directed at milo vera a local columnist theres total impunity said jose antonio calcanio president of the federation of mexican journalists associations which represents 137 journalist groups nationwide the government has no interest in resolving any of these cases calcanio said its only when theres a prominent case like amado ramirez that they pretend to act but then they forget and nothing happens two suspects were arrested in the days after the radio hosts murder but both were released on bail many of ramirezs colleagues suspect the men were scapegoats
266235 the u s government would like to think that drug violence is just a problem south of the rio grande it isnt
266236 were seeing outright lawlessness along the u s mexican border things are just getting out of hand
266237 u s citizens should be aware of the risk posed by the deteriorating security situation
266238 if the same circumstance that now exist in mexico existed in any other country the u s state dept would advise americans to not even go there
266239 if its not safe for u s soldiers than it is unsafe for other americans

266244 it has a little of everything pleasurable in all coffees earthy musty tone the heaviest bodied ive ever tasted its almost syrupy and the aroma is very unique
266245 game to try something different and unusual ive never had anybody complain they all seem to feel its worth the price
266246 ive never tasted anything like it its an unbelieveable taste in your mouth richness body earthiness smooth
266247 its excellent coffee but i always caution customers that you cant get 75 worth of quality in any coffee theres no such thing youre paying for the experience of quaffing the worlds rarest and most expensive coffee the palate would recognize it as sumatran or indonesian right away it has earthy tones of natural processed sumatra mandheling it has low acidity with a syrupy body theres something else there a nuance in the flavor profile that i cant describe and when ive challanged others no one else can either its almost alien a tiny little flavor note highly exotic

266353 yes asshole i put that blanket on the ground for you to stomp in the middle of it and let your dog with muddy paws run over it as well thank you so much dickcheese
266354 makes it harder for the intelligence community agencies to resist
266355 theres no doubt about it we picked several from different parts of the planet took them aboard our recon vessels probed them all the way through theyre completely meat
266356 thats impossible what about the radio signals the messages to the stars
266357 they use the radio waves to talk but the signals dont come from them the signals come from machines
266358 so who made the machines thats who we want to contact
266359 they made the machines thats what im trying to tell you meat made the machines
266360 thats ridiculous how can meat make a machine youre asking me to believe in sentient meat
266361 im not asking you im telling you these creatures are the only sentient race in the sector and theyre made out of meat
266362 maybe theyre like the orfolei you know a carbon based intelligence that goes through a meat stage
266363 nope theyre born meat and they die meat we studied them for several of their life spans which didnt take too long do you have any idea the life span of meat
266364 spare me okay maybe theyre only part meat you know like the weddilei a meat head with an electron plasma brain inside
266365 nope we thought of that since they do have meat heads like the weddilei but i told you we probed them theyre meat all the way through
266366 oh there is a brain all right its just that the brain is made out of meat
266367 youre not understanding are you the brain does the thinking the meat
266368 thinking meat youre asking me to believe in thinking meat
266369 yes thinking meat conscious meat loving meat dreaming meat the meat is the whole deal are you getting the picture
266370 finally yes they are indeed made out meat and theyve been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years
266371 first it wants to talk to us then i imagine it wants to explore the universe contact other sentients swap ideas and information the usual
266372 thats the idea thats the message theyre sending out by radio hello anyone out there anyone home that sort of thing
266373 they actually do talk then they use words ideas concepts
266374 they do but what do you think is on the radio meat sounds you know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise they talk by flapping their meat at each other they can even sing by squirting air through their meat
266375 omigod singing meat this is altogether too much so what do you advise
266376 officially we are required to contact welcome and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant without prejudice fear or favor unofficially i advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing
266377 it seems harsh but there is a limit do we really want to make contact with meat
266378 just one they can travel to other planets in special meat containers but they cant live on them and being meat they only travel through c space which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim infinitesimal in fact
266379 so we just pretend theres no one home in the universe
266380 cruel but you said it yourself who wants to meet meat and the ones who have been aboard our vessels the ones you have probed youre sure they wont remember
266381 theyll be considered crackpots if they do we went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that were just a dream to them
266382 a dream to meat how strangely appropriate that we should be meats dream
266383 good agreed officially and unofficially case closed any others anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy
266384 yes a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a class nine star in g445 zone was in contact two galactic rotations ago wants to be friendly again
266385 and why not imagine how unbearably how unutterably cold the universe would be if one were all alone
266386 perhaps my children have sinned and have cursed god in their hearts
266387 a man shows his character by what he laughs at

266400 aa used to be recommended for alcoholics after treatment but is no longer due to the fact that people being referred or sentenced to aa have killed the heart of it that it is a voluntary self sought activity
266401 what weve done really is put numbers to a very human problem people arent surprised at the numbers because theyre living it every day but theyre still dramatic
266402 weve been very careful to only pick crimes that we thought were caused by alcohol not all the ones involving alcohol for example
266403 we attributed only half of alcohol involved assaults to alcohol and thats pretty conservative
266404 freedom to serve is truly the freedom by which we live the freedom in which we have our being
266405 to all those who wish to secede from a a we extend a cheerful invitation to do just that if they can do better by other means we are glad if after a trial they cannot do better we know they face a choice they can go mad or die or return to alcoholics anonymous the decision is wholly theirs as a matter of fact most of them do come back in the light of all this experience it becomes evident that in the event of a really extensive split we would not have to waste time persuading the dissenters to stay with us in good confidence and cheer we could actually invite them to secede and we would wish them well if they did so should they do better under new auspices and changed conditions we would ask ourselves if we could not learn from their fresh experience but if it turned out they did worse under other circumstances and that there was a steady increase in their discontent and their death rate the chances are very strong that most of them would eventually return to a a without anger or coercion we would need only to watch and to wait upon gods will unless we make a problem where there is really none at all there need be no difficulty we could still go about our business in good cheer the supply of alcoholics in our time will be inexhaustible and we can continue to be glad that we have evolved at least one formula by which many will come to sobriety and a new life
266406 in preceding concepts much attention has been drawn to the extraordinary liberties which the a a traditions accord to the individual members and to his group no penalties to be inflicted for nonconformity to a a principles no fees or dues to be levied voluntary contributions only no member to be expelled from a a membership always to be a choice of the individual each a a group to conduct its internal affairs as it wishes it being merely requested to abstain from acts that might injure a a as a whole and finally any group of alcoholics gathered together for sobriety may call themselves an a a group provided that as a group they have no other purpose or affiliation

266659 speaking again somewhat broadly the past and its effects on you are chronic you are in your mid 20s these things will be with you for many years so i suggest that you hunker down you settle in for the long haul you shore up on many fronts build structures now for shelter and support seek joy in beauty and in experiences that stay fresh and sharp in memory fill your memory with art and music and light to compete with those other memories that perch like ravens eyeing your carcass waiting for you to slip take an averaging approach seek to increase the joy in your life in as many ways as you know how do not seek things that are supposed to bring you joy but which only bring you worry if you are not comfortable with intimacy then do not look to intimacy for joy there will be no joy there for you there will be only rawness instead look to safe things that you know do bring you joy and increase their number in your life you are at war with something that seeks to undermine you you cannot know when it will strike but you can shore up your surfaces and build shelters against it and you can take all the joy you can find and finally take this thought with you your past is your partner for better or worse sometimes it is an impediment and sometimes it is an aide oddly enough your history can serve as a priceless well of experience giving you a view of the world few others have allowing you to see in certain instances the pure ineluctable depth of tragedy the power of fate you can understand human failures as others cannot you can see clearly the temptations of repeating the cycle of blunting the discomfort with drugs and alcohol of acting out compulsively

266971 im going to assume that youre trying to control canada thistle although the first step is to identify the species you have
266972 geological maps are essential tools in finding natural resources e g water hydrocarbons and minerals and when planning to mitigate geohazards e g earthquakes volcanoes and radon natural resources are a crucial source of wealth for all nations especially those that need to develop and build their economies identifying geohazards is often a matter of life or death other challenges facing all nations in the 21st century include rising sea levels management of waste nuclear or domestic and storage of carbon knowledge of the rocks that we all live on has become increasingly important and sharing that knowledge at a time of global environmental change is crucial
266973 today you can go to the onegeology website and get geological maps from across the globe from an overview of our entire planet to larger scale maps of the rocks of individual nations you also have the ability to hop from this web site to higher resolution applied maps and data on linked national web sites participating nations are contributing to a legacy for humankind by acting locally they are thinking globally

266975 i liked most of the food i ate in taiwan
266976 the only true currency in this bankrupt world is what you share with someone else when youre uncool
266977 that most of our ecosystems are no longer rich is beyond debate and today most of the surviving remnants of the native flora that formed them have been finished off by development or invaded by alien species
266978 i thought with all the concerns in this neighborhood and ive been on the west side for 11 years all the concerns people have this would be something that would empower kids and give them more confidence and encourage parents as well
266979 we investigators spent 20 years attempting to learn about these animals on the high seas and temperate ocean waters with only slow progress
266980 this work will be useful for marine resource managers and others who want to understand how leatherbacks spend their days in the new england region and beyond
266981 weve never known whether theyre coming to forage or just passing through
266982 understanding where they travel and how they use the water column will help us mitigate these human interactions
266983 people are still circulating petitions on her behalf but this is a done deal
266984 hillary clinton is 100 percent committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states and realizes there are passionate feelings that remain among many of her supporters
266985 the ultimate goal is to find new ways to help people like the armed forces and first responders stay alert and on top of things when they have to be awake for extended periods of time
266986 we have drugs now that can keep people awake but theyre addictive and lose their effectiveness with repeated use this research should help us find methods for maintaining mental acuity that have more specific effects are less addictive and retain their potency
266987 this tests the flies mental capacity in two ways first theyve got to remember that the lighted vial is the one that has quinine in it and then theyve got to suppress their natural instinct to fly toward the light
266988 using this gene and other related genes we may be able to find better ways to boost performance for someone like a relief worker whos had to stay awake for six straight days trying to save people trapped by an earthquake
266989 i want to emphasize though that this type of treatment would just be for people who absolutely have to stay awake
266990 its not about trying to cram too many hours in your day everyone else should just suck it up and get a good nights sleep
266991 our results suggest that the stylized facts that the competitive theory was designed to explain are an oversimplification of how retail gasoline prices are actually set
266992 competition authorities should be hesitant to accept the competitive model of gasoline pricing without a full analysis of pricing in other retail gasoline markets
266993 if other marine species respond similarly and theres no evidence yet that they were in trouble
266994 the analogies are quite simple we observed a 25 percent reduction in fertilization success at reduced ph which is equivalent to a 25 percent reduction in the spawning stock of the species
266995 the current problem is being caused by the rate of increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere not the absolute level
266996 to put it simply the carbon dioxide is rising too quickly for the oceans natural buffering system to catch up
266997 we need to begin to respond globally to counteract the coming impacts of ocean acidification an effort requiring at least as much global participation as current efforts to stem carbon dioxide emissions
266998 i really hope im wrong about the broader implications of our work
266999 davis stood over him and told him not to get out of bed
267000 his body language was very aggressive mr veraeus was frightened
267001 he had far too much to drink he remembers drinking whiskey and thats not normally his drink
267002 he is shocked and appalled by the way he has behaved it is completely out of character for him
267003 the test is a measure of long term glucose control but doctors dont typically use it to screen for or diagnose the disease
267004 theres reason to believe it could help identify many of the estimated six million people in the u s who have diabetes but dont know it
267005 if a patient is scheduled for a physical he or she may tune up by changing their regimen for a few days and throw off their test results causing doctors to miss the patients usual pattern of high blood sugar
267006 could greatly enhance how well were able to identify people with diabetes
267007 summer is a crucial time for pet safety awareness we live in north carolina and it can get extremely hot here so it is important that people know the proper way to care for their pets during the summer conditions
267008 i think this dog days of summer campaign that the red cross is supporting is incredible
267009 the united states is attempting to verify reports that a july 28 airstrike
267010 intelligence sources told the jawa report last week that the hunt was on in pakistan for a big fish could this be the big fish they were talking about
267011 the major and i mean major caveat here is that zawahiri has been rumored to have been killed on a number of previous occasions
267012 unexpressed concerns are challenging because they can lead to different expectations and understanding of the problems patients are concerned about and treatment recommendations that are poorly tailored to patient needs
267013 physicians will have little chance to correct or modify them unfortunately unexpressed concerns may contribute to breakdowns in communication which are frustrating for both physicians and patients
267014 knowing that older adults frequently dont voice all their concerns should help surgeons create opportunities for patients who are reluctant to bring them up
267015 valganciclovir has been shown safe in the current study and the population of children treated did not develop ptld warranting future trials to confirm a positive effect in the management of ebv infection
267016 we have developed a relatively standardized approach to the presence of the high load carrier state which aims to gradually reduce immune suppression while carefully monitoring for any evidence of breakthrough rejection
267017 we agree that additional trials of valganciclovir are needed to establish a beneficial effect of this drug
267018 the results of the present study show a marked increase in antiviral effect in patients when ribavirin is added to the combination of r1626 and peginterferon alfa 2a
267019 this phase 2a study has demonstrated a potent reduction in hcv rna by r1626 and high viral responses with up to 74 percent rapid viral response after 4 weeks of treatment the strong antiviral effect between r1626 peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin suggests that the dose of one or both of these agents could be lowered to improve tolerability without significantly compromising efficacy
267020 the decreases in hcv rna from baseline observed with r1626 indicates potent antiviral activity and lack of viral load rebound in the significant majority of patients following 14 days of monotherapy

267031 we strive to shepherd wind and control the vapor but the world goes indifferently on its way as it has always done
267032 we like jeff harris its hard not to like him
267033 democratic voters when you pick up your ballots tuesday and select an attorney general fill in the box next to jeff harris name hes the obvious choice and hell make missouri a fine attorney general
267034 its a student run conference and i think thats why its been so successful
267035 i think this is a big retention tool because if a student can become involved on campus then more than likely theyre going to stay it welcomes students in and gives them a since of belonging
267036 theyll get a vast wealth of knowledge and at the same time get a chance to meet people that they may not have had the chance to meet
267037 i will do the idol until im in my 60s

267041 you take beautiful photos i really enjoyed visiting your site thanks for sharing it with me
267042 thanks for dropping by keep up with those great shots
267043 obama was anticipating you know that race will be an issue although john mccain has worked very very diligently to make sure that race is not the issue
267044 well let the chips fall where they may when it comes to how people perceive this but we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain whos fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
267045 the good news is their lenders are continuing to work with them
267046 without an agreement that gives them access to their revolving credit line they probably have a very challenging cash position but this buys them some time to negotiate a permanent solution
267047 when jon miller signed his contract it said that upon payout of the contract he could not work for a variety of competitors including yahoo until march 2009
267048 there are some democrats who think things are going to look a lot different in the makeup of the next congress and why dont we just wait until we are more advantaged
267049 its my hope that theyll come back in september chastened by their constituents and ready to work with republicans on tackling the energy crisis facing this nation
267050 expanding access to americas abundant diverse and currently locked away energy resources
267051 are here to protect the interests of the oil companies plain and simple
267052 republicans in the congress and the president dont want to do any of the things that would have an impact on gas prices immediately
267053 our country faces a critical challenge because of skyrocketing energy costs
267054 this is not a democratic issue or a republican issue it is an issue that affects all of us
267055 im never confident they will do anything and im normally right
267056 i think i can win a masters series and id love to do it this week i played well last week and had a tight match against nadal
267057 this week im playing well again you know hopefully i can do it
267058 he was serving well and i threw in a lot of unforced errors but once i got going i played really well
267059 ive never been to the final of a masters but this looks like my best chance im playing well enough and can hopefully come through
267060 to go two breaks down a set and two breaks down would have been tough to come back from
267061 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
267062 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
267063 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
267064 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
267065 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
267066 a city really none of us were comfortable walking in the streets to one that was basically safe
267067 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military

267070 daniel kelly was well aware what deserting his daughter meant to her safety and welfare
267071 helpless child sitting unattended unkempt and unwashed in a small stroller in her own urine and feces
267072 this behavior indicates that andrea kelly did not merely allow danieal to die
267073 she may have even wanted her disabled daughter to die
267074 the message is very clear to her to do anything other than appear to support him would result in escalated violence against her
267075 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
267076 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
267077 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
267078 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
267079 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
267080 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
267081 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
267082 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
267083 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
267084 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
267085 as popular or unpopular as it is for as tough or as difficult as it is i think the organization has stood strong
267086 theyre decisive and theyre continuing to work through this everyone wants this resolved dont get me wrong no one thought it would get to this point but this is where we are

267093 every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired in a final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed

267122 i ask you now please please bring snooks back there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way
267123 i think the average person has access to a very large audience potential that they wouldnt get over broadcast tv airwaves
267124 anyone can post content and potentially reach an audience of a few million its a way to bring attention to your cause
267125 when we created youtube we wanted to create a place where people can connect with others through online video
267126 its inspiring to see that its now being used for such important causes making the most of our community and a truly global reach it offers
267127 the biggest hurdle there ultimately is just because you post something doesnt mean people will care it ultimately relies on the community itself to help virally distribute and draw attention to any specific video
267128 you can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time but you can not fool all of the people all of the time

267138 last year was a really angst driven politically motivated type of feel
267139 so this year with the way things are going with the economy and peoples heads and gas prices we really wanted to try and provide something where people could get away from all the crap and have a good time
267140 in a time when the only thing on the west coast was gangster rap they created a space for someone like me from the inner city or just a young black kid from a single parent home to be able to be different to be me and let me know there was someone out there like me
267141 they gave me a sense of belonging a voice i cant put into words how much the music meant to me it was literally the soundtrack of my life
267142 we did the press conference for rock the bells and i was literally almost in tears
267143 to be up there with pharcyde and tribe de la its like oh my god were all excited to see each other every night but im sure im a little more excited than they are to see them do their thing night after night and just to be in the same area and be able to walk up to them and say good show its gonna be awesome
267144 its hard to feel loved when an infant is screaming to be fed at 3 a m
267145 oh fatina se ci sei ascoltami se esisti davvero fammi trovare magari sotto casa un ramoscello per poter incantare

267160 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
267161 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
267162 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step
267163 theres no question the challenging u s macro environment has hindered our ability
267164 al crocker set out to produce in limited quantity the most opulent fastest best handling motorcycle in the world the premier roadster it was a hotrod cruiser the first power cruiser youve got to remember it was 15 mph faster than its harley and indian competition and even outperformed the brough superior ss100 and vincent series a they are absolutely the holy grail of motorcycles they were built to an ideal rather than a standard a crocker is a crocker nothing comes close

267166 24 200 241 99 is whitelist the nominum resolver software has additional protections that cannot be measured by this tool
267167 after these violent attacks we have had to suspend activities and evacuate all our staff from tawila and shangil tobaya
267168 it was a difficult decision because this suspension of activities leaves the people with no medical care but it is impossible for our teams to work and provide medical aid without a minimum guarantee of security and respect for humanitarian work
267169 access to maternal infant prevention and to preventative treatment makes a difference

267174 instead of keeping their promise to drain the swamp of corruption in washington house democrats are sinking in it
267175 im asking the minority to allow me to join in with them in this resolution to say this matter should be cleared up but theres no need even for mean spirited people in the minority to say that im a discredit to the united states congress
267176 this was the biggest undertaking since the creation of the platform
267177 this gives us a lot of control of the powertrain within the frame helps us reduce sidle shake and is another key element in the tooling of the chassis
267178 i dont think they should have a monopoly on how i surf for news
267179 he is very game he has done everything early he started walking at 10 months and i think that is due to the fact that hes a very curious kid

267189 does red robin offer nutritional information for its menu items
267190 because of the millions of combinations available and our desire to frequently give you new menu options it is impossible to provide accurate nutritional data

267250 im happy with the match although we had little training we would like to thank vietnamese fans and the hosts for giving us a warm welcome and good preparation
267251 having the brazilian players in vietnam is a once in a lifetime event
267252 its a great opportunity to see ronaldinho pato and anderson
267253 its unbelievable to see them playing football in vietnam the vietnamese are like the brazilians in their love for soccer

267256 i know that some feminists will attack me for this but seriously do you think women are the only ones who are objectified in entertainment
267257 i dont really get why bitchy jones is the de facto standard of what a dominant woman is she is just one person writing about fucking her stable why not just live and let live
267258 her ranting style detracts from any serious points that she may be trying to make it all sounds like sour grapes to me
267259 it is rather frustrating when she is being discussed on tv as having such an influential and well read blog and yet has such narrow minded opinions
267260 i do not think that bj is a dominant i do not think that bj is a woman and it really does not matter to me whatever bjs blog might have been worth has disappeared over the term of the blog it has devolved the same way that the news media has it is all about attention and shock bj is just another sanctimonious attention whore
267261 im not particularly impressed by anything shes written but to each their own im sure there are guys wanking to it at this moment
267262 personally i find bitchy jones more annoying than elise sutton
267263 i could have agreed with and even sympathized with bitchy jones had she just refrained from the cheap shots and the insinuations that attractive pro dommes are fake undominant money grubbing bimbos
267264 her rants about the word domme strap ons and feminization are just annoying
267265 the profanity while plenty gratuitous lacks any sense of appreciation for the art
267266 im not up in her business telling her shes not a real dominant because shes not hot so why is she trying to say that people like me who are attractive pro dommes are just a male manufactured joke
267267 ill shut this damn thread down if this stupid bitchy jones shit gets started again lol the name alone screams koo koo

267276 who fell blindly in love with the drug in all its forms without a second thought but this book is also for those who just like me found that ending this love affair was much more difficult than they could ever have imagined
267277 it didnt feel wrong dangerous or difficult i just enjoyed life more when my senses were heightened and when i allowed the reality of everyday life to become a little distorted after a couple of tokes i seemed to feel the disparate parts of my consciousness clicking into place
267278 i wanted to be clearheaded again to be able to remember things to be aware of time passing at normal speed not stretched or shrunk i wanted more of a social life i wanted to be more confident and no so self obsessed i wanted to be in control and less lazy
267279 turn away from a pleasure that had evolved into a routine then into a habit and finally into full blown dependency
267280 i needed to smoke just to feel normal my tolerance for dope had reached such a point that if the thc in my system fell below a certain level i would feel a deep lack a terrible emptiness
267281 the almost universal dismissal from the medical and drug treatment professions about the reality of cannabis withdrawal very little specialist help is available to anybody who has lost control over their dope smoking
267282 our dopamine levels arent meant to be tuned to such a high pitch on an everyday basis maybe a few times a month or the occasional binge but if youre smoking relentlessly day after day particularly strong skunk then is it any wonder you might find it hard to take pleasure in the ordinary things of life
267283 the feeling of being overwhelmed by even the simplest interactions with other people or becoming frustrated by what you would normally consider straightforward tasks
267284 night sweats are difficult because combined with light sleeping they can cause discomfort to your partner as well the sweating can last for anything up to 21 days but usually you are over the worst after about 10
267285 be reassured that this is a very common symptom the important thing is to make sure you are taking some nutrients onboard otherwise you will start to feel week light headed and slightly sick
267286 feel like jet lag and the best advice is to treat it as such in other words try not to go to bed as soon as you come home from work
267287 at clearhead we have found that it takes on average around four to six weeks for most people to fully adjust to not using cannabis others will still hit upon lingering symptoms up to two months after smoking their last joint
267288 el nico consuelo en este momento es que aunque estelle se ha marchado sophia seguir siempre con nosotros

267308 they are grateful for the bounty of federal dollars he has delivered he can do more in six years that any of his opponents can do in 20 hired him to bring money back to this state his skill at inserting earmarks into budget bills ted stevens honesty or lack thereof

267311 crist praised mccain for his support of florida issues such as a national catastrophic fund for disasters and a continued oil drilling ban off of floridas coasts
267312 i do not support a national catastrophic insurance policy that insurance policy is there and its called fema and its called national disaster preparedness i still do not have confidence that fema is capable of handling those responsibilities
267313 not in favor of spending 200 billion a year simply for the state of florida
267314 family friends have been really supportive to the becking family from bringing food to taking the kids places the outreach has been amazing

267316 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
267317 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
267318 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step
267319 its dead in the water because the concert at londons o2 arena last december was a success there was hope of a tour but that was a lot of speculation it would be great if they would but as far as we know that is dead in the water

267323 our paper now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patients own neurons this will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind this disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life
267324 we dont know yet how similar they are to the motor neurons in als patients
267325 while the cells exhibit many properties that are typical of motor neurons we dont yet know whether they will be prone to degeneration that will allow us to mimic the disease in the culture dish and therefore to screen potential drugs
267326 project a l s has always maintained that collaboration between scientists is the answer to understanding and treating this disease
267327 we are thrilled to have catalyzed the harvard columbia collaboration that led to this discovery
267328 therapeutic use of the cells is probably a long way off
267329 right now there are safety issues with ips cells including a risk of cancer we also dont know how to reintroduce cells into a sick adult in a way that will be beneficial all these hurdles need to be overcome first before we can think about using the cells to treat disease but we can start immediately to evaluate them as a tool for drug discovery
267330 we are excited to be able to facilitate and support truly important cross institutional collaborations such as this significant research effort by harvard and columbia
267331 our interest in using genomics to study metabolic diseases led us to screen dna from liver cells that expressed foxa2 with an assay called chip on chip
267332 we were surprised that a cluster of genes involved in lipid and steroid metabolism was identified by being bound to foxa2
267333 in order to lay the groundwork for developing new treatments we have to determine how foxa2 itself is regulated
267334 celebrities should have the freedom to do as they wish and the paparazzi are infringing upon their right to live
267335 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue

267344 over the past few years i have heard a lot of noise about how great it would be to see kde coming to windows world
267345 but so far knol looks to me like the biggest risk might be to google itself thats because it provides one more way for spammers to dog the spammer hunter

267355 we deliberately moved away from the existing humanoid service robots when we designed care o bot 3
267356 first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win
267357 ive been at gandhi stage three for maybe a couple of years
267358 if youre trying to make waves certainly in science theres a lot of people who are going to have insufficient vision to bother to understand what youre trying to say
267359 so far from plausible that it commands no respect at all within the informed scientific community
267360 weve known for some time that individuals with 22q11 2 microdeletions are at high risk of developing schizophrenia
267361 by digging further into this chromosome we have been able to see at the gene expression level that abnormalities in micrornas can be linked to the behavioral and cognitive deficits associated with the disease
267362 these agreements confirm the growing trend in the u s to build solar power plants at a scale rivalling those in market leading countries such as germany and spain
267363 our wind energy capacity is growing faster than anyplace else
267364 so its no longer really alternative energy this is very mainstream
267365 the difference is that because the winds are so much stronger here in the u s we are actually providing more wind generated electricity than germany
267366 its been a bit of a struggle but thankfully weve been able to get it through here theyre basically going to allow us to do it and the reds were very co operative at the 11th hour
267367 i complained that i had no shoes until i met a man that had no feet

267369 they both seemed to want to accelerate together and the white car missed the curve and drove right into the cornfield they were both traveling at a high rate of speed
267370 the next thing they heard is the mother from next door in the house screaming
267371 you just wait until my family hears you better lock your doors and windows
267372 if the mother had gone to that house and found d j with his wife this would not have happened
267373 but they jumped to the conclusion that since hes gay he must also be a child molester
267374 the april summit meeting was probably the last hurrah for the spp
267375 the strategy of acting on technical issues in an incremental bureaucratic way and keeping the issues away from public view has generated more suspicion than accomplishments
267376 from the right have come attacks based on cultural anxieties of being overrun by mexican immigrants and fears that cooperation with canada and mexico could lead down a slippery slope toward a north american union
267377 from the left came attacks based on economic fears of jobs lost due to unfair trading practices
267378 these two sets of fears came together in a perfect storm that was pushed forward by a surplus of hot air from talk show hosts on radio and television
267379 in the face of this criticism the bush administration was silent and the democratic candidates competed for votes in the rust belt states where unions and many working people have come to see nafta and globalization much as commentator lou dobbs does
267380 dobbs among others viewed a report by a 2005 council on foreign relations task force which i chaired building a north american community as the manifesto of a conspiracy to subvert american sovereignty
267381 dobbs claimed that the cfr study proposed a north american union although it did not
267382 i do not propose a north american union i propose a north american community
267383 three sovereign governments that seek to strengthen bonds of cooperation
267384 i dont think a political union of north america is an inherently bad idea nor do i think it is a good idea for right now
267385 the three heads of state must also commit to building a new consciousness a new way of thinking about ones neighbors and about the continental agenda
267386 americans canadians and mexicans can be nationals and north americans at the same time
267387 to connect central and southern mexico to the united states with roads ports and communications

267390 perch mi sono rotta di vedere un cox espanso come il polistirolo
267391 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record
267392 i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
267393 did you know that even the most highly skilled trained and educated musician will not be able to play great music on an instrument that is out of tune
267394 yes it makes perfect sense doesnt it if the instrument is out of tune it doesnt matter what the talent level is when it is back in tune and if the musician knows how to play it it will sound fine yet i want you to look at yourself and see if youre not trying to play great music on an instrument that is out of tune
267395 i mean that all the skill education or talent you possess might not be given the opportunity to express itself fully if youre trying to apply it on an instrument that is out of tune lets say this musician plays the piano the musician can continue to improve his or her skills technique and so on but if he or she brings all of that to a piano that remains out of tune the music will still not sound very good you are like the musician i speak of

267397 theres a lot of attention today on global food shortages
267398 weve found a gene that is key for proper chloroplast function this finding might some day help scientists develop plants that grow better and can serve as more nutritious food
267399 we have now shown that an analogous process is required for proper chloroplast function
267400 moreover without fro7 plants sown in iron deficient soil died as young seedlings our findings are of particular interest because how iron gets into chloroplasts has not been well understood despite the significance of iron in chloroplasts
267401 enriching crops with mineral and vitamin nutrients will provide sustainable solutions to malnutrition
267402 we are left with the prospect that what has been termed our best known analogue to earths modern glaciation is in fact poorly known
267403 this study is an example of the wealth of untapped climate information stored in earths deep time geologic record millions of years ago
267404 these kinds of discoveries may greatly improve our understanding and prediction of modern climate change
267405 the late paleozoic tropical climate was not buffered against cold from the high latitudes as everyone had thought
267406 the evidence we found indicates that glaciers were common at this time even in tropical latitudes this calls into question traditional assumptions of long lasting equatorial warmth in the late paleozoic and raises the possibility of large scale and unexpected climate change in the tropics during that time
267407 we have about 40 000 genes in every cell and the main reason a brain cell is a brain cell is because only a small fraction of the genes are turned on the remaining genes that are not expressed are shut down by an epigenetic process called dna methylation
267408 interestingly the nature of this chemical modification is long term and hard to reverse and this fits with depression
267409 the whole idea that the genome is so malleable in the brain is surprising finding that epigenetic mechanisms continue to influence gene expression is pretty unusual
267410 these observations open an entirely new avenue of research and potential therapeutic interventions
267411 this is an intriguing contribution to efforts aimed at identifying the molecular bases of alcohol tolerance
267412 this represents a novel and elegant mechanism by which neurons are able to adapt to alcohol
267413 moreover since adaptation or tolerance to the drug likely contributes to alcohol abuse our findings identify a potential molecular target for therapeutic intervention
267414 this study demonstrates for the first time that alcohol exposure can cause rapid changes in microrna levels altering gene expression and perhaps behavior
267415 in future studies it will be interesting to determine if similar microrna based regulatory mechanisms influence alcohol problems in human populations
267416 this discovery has potentially solved a mystery that has been plaguing the avian veterinary community since the 1970s
267417 these results clearly reveal the existence of an avian reservoir of remarkably diverse bornaviruses that are dramatically different from anything seen in other animals
267418 this provides a very compelling lead in the long standing search for a viral cause of pdd
267419 with the development of molecular clones and diagnostic tests for abv we can now begin to explore both the epidemiology of the virus and how it is linked to the disease state
267420 theres no excuse for any number of heat stroke deaths since they are all preventable with the proper precautions
267421 i think i was the first guy off the golf course that day at washington
267422 i guess they wanted to get some negative tests in before anything happens i guess they figured im one of the least likely to be on something you have to go to the gym to be on steroids
267423 why why bother you want me to go even more crazy
267424 i hit the ball about as solid as ive hit it in a really long time
267425 if i hit the next couple of weeks like i hit it today thats not going to be a problem
267426 they want skill to play a factor in every single shot and if you have rough like you have out here today it takes a lot of skill to maneuver a ball on the green when youve got trees in front of you but you can do it if you hit a really good shot i think the players really like what they see here
267427 this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour
267428 last year not so much but this year all the guys are talking about how much they love it because we can play it we can hit shots we can be creative and challenge ourselves with some recoveries like on 18 that wouldnt have been a possibility last year

267430 you want to know whos a real medicine man hes the one who doesnt say i m a medicine man he doesnt ask you to come to him youve got to go and ask him and youll find hes always there among his own people
267431 everyone got to find the right path you cant see it so its hard to find no one can show you each person got to find the path by himself
267432 it was a good day you cant be displeased with a 65 on this course or any course
267433 i hate to say it i think i could have shot a 61 or 62 today
267434 i mean his was the open championship mine was the senior open championship but still when you have it in your grasp like that you have something a little bit in common
267435 so it was a nice walk on tuesday with these guys and i got up and struck the ball nicely i said ok new week lets just go at it again
267436 i played well i just couldnt get it over the hump
267437 some were very mushy very soft they put a lot of moisture in some greens and not in others
267438 it was tough judging especially the second shot not knowing what the golf ball was going to do it got into a bit of a guessing game at the end of the day
267439 its such a mental brain drain by the time you do your calculations and try to figure out whether its 20 percent or 30 percent or 18 percent
267440 by the time you do the math in your head then you have to figure out what shot you want to hit
267441 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
267442 id say today was like yesterday i play 15 good holes and then again i leave a few shots out there i just cant do that not in this type of championship its costing me too much and then i always have to do catchup and ive not been able to do that
267443 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
267444 i birdied the first two holes it was nice to take advantage of the two par 5s
267445 and i managed to take advantage of another par 5 for a birdie i think anything in the 60s is going to be pretty good today
267446 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record i was going for the fourth at 14 but i ran it by from 30 feet i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
267447 today i birdied the holes i was supposed to birdie
267448 all in all today i did everything i was supposed to im not used to holing 20 foot putts so when i make those its an extra bonus
267449 i love this course and i love coming here every year
267450 its not the hardest course but its a fun course if you hit quality shots you have a great chance at birdie
267451 hes played the broadmoor probably more times than i have the last five or 10 years
267452 he knows how to read the greens if i get confused or get into a problem he knows my game
267453 hes got a tough time coming up obviously and i think if you asked him he would say he wouldnt want to be anyplace else
267454 hes got a tough week in front of him this will be easy for him
267455 i made three or four really poor swings on the back
267456 i think i under clubbed 10 half a club and it cost me three shots from the middle of the fairway and you just cant do that out here
267457 its great to have him out there he knows the game and he understands me and i dont know what more you can get out of a caddie than that
267458 i spent about 3 1 2 hours just stretching before i even went to the range just trying to get loose
267459 its not even my knee i cant even bend down to line up a putt because my thighs hurt so much
267460 im going to get up about 5 oclock and start the whole routine again
267461 i just have to stretch out my knee is pretty bad because of these hills

267523 youre not seeing a lot of 80 year olds coming in with texting injuries they do tend to be a younger demographic and then depending on whether youre in the city or not that determines what we see in a city where theres a lot of driving and commuting were seeing the most accidents related to texting which can be very serious or even fatal
267524 in cities where people are pedestrians and walkers like new york chicago and baltimore where there is a lot of pedestrian traffic were seeing a lot of falls because people arent paying attention can you walk and chew gum except that this is more than chewing gum because youre really concentrating on something else
267525 normally when you fall you put your hands out reflexively to protect your face if you have anything in your hand youre not able to drop it as quickly and protect your face so were seeing a lot of facial and head injuries chins and even eye injuries where people were poked in the eye
267526 she was unconscious and it appeared shed suffered a massive brain injury you could tell she saw the truck at the last moment because her cell phone was dropped right where she was struck just off the curb and she was thrown about 20 or 30 feet it was horrifying the truck stopped the driver was devastated i was amazed to hear she survived all the way to trauma center but died in the er
267527 no 1 if youre involved in any type of activity that requires concentration including walking you really shouldnt be texting obviously that goes for even more concentration reliant activities such as biking rollerblading playing a sport and of course driving you really shouldnt do it if you get a message while walking that you have to respond to you should get out of the flow of traffic stand somewhere then read or send a message
267528 with everything thats going on with cell phones and the jury is out about the electromagnetic rays i dont think texting is a bad thing for kids to do we still dont know long term what the effects of prolonged cell phone use are

267570 the good news is that it didnt get much worse since april but we could have started the healing time back then instead of now
267571 i like my chances it was very hard with the wind today but i played well and im feeling very good for the weekend
267572 its disappointing because i wanted to come here and enjoy it and not be worried about playing at the weekend

267584 senator obama is committed to reforming the current system and i look forward to working on this and a wide range of other reform issues with him when he becomes president but this decision was a mistake
267585 should both major party nominees elect to receive public funding this would preserve the public financing system now in danger of collapse and facilitate the conduct of campaigns freed from any dependence on private fund raising
267586 senator john mccain has already pledged to accept this fundraising pledge
267587 i do not expect that a workable effective agreement will be reached overnight
267588 when the time comes we will talk and our commitment will be tested i will pass that test and i hope that the republican nominee passes his
267589 tell his millions of small dollar donors that they couldnt invest financially in his campaign
267590 of course republicans will whine that obama broke his promise theyve got no other choice mccain is getting crushed financially and has little of the popular support that obama enjoys

267599 its not going to get any more pressurized than playing in the last round of the u s open with tiger given everything that was going on with his knee and trying to win the tournament as well
267600 i have tried to carry on the confidence that i built up there into this event
267601 whether tiger plays or not has no bearing on how i feel in any particular week
267602 obviously we all know hes got a fabulous record here but theres not much point in talking about a player thats not playing
267603 i hit a driver and wedge to about 12 inches at the 10th which was my first hole and then driver wedge to about eight inches on 11

267609 our goal is to win that tournament but its not do or die

267899 no es conveniente ni justo que sea la variable que contribuya a frenar la presi n inflacionaria

267901 el compromiso lo mantenemos pero tambi n hay que cuidar el empleo
267902 estamos a medio camino y ya corri el 60 de la administraci n hay que mejorar el ritmo de los ajustes salariales la productividad ha crecido m s que los salarios en estos tres a os por eso creemos que los ajustes no provocar n presi n inflacionaria
267903 de verificarse este crecimiento entre 2005 y 2008 el salario real medio privado habr crecido 18 7 rest ndole un incremento de alrededor de 10 en lo que queda del actual gobierno para recuperar lo perdido del anterior
267904 evidentemente no todos podr n obtener los m ximos aumentos previstos en las pautas salariales
267905 lo cual hace dif cil estar cerca de recuperar lo perdido
267906 pierdan cierto grado de relaci n con la evoluci n de los precios de la econom a
267907 m s all de compartir el esp ritu desindexatorio sin el cual se podr an reforzar presiones inflacionarias tal como est planteada hay demasiados riesgos para el poder adquisitivo los trabajadores de sectores menos din micos y con menor poder de negociaci n quedan relegados en el objetivo de recuperar el 100 del salario real perdido en el anterior gobierno

267919 i may not have spoken out the way you would have wanted me to speak out

267925 naturally they already have a goalkeeper but psg appeal to me a great deal even when i played up north i went to the parc des princes to see matches but as for anything coming of this lets wait and see
267926 will i be back for the supercup no the recovery is going well but i wont be there i need two more months
267927 there is a game going on in europe where the big clubs tap up our players wenger said
267928 they let us do the work and develop the players and then they think they can just come in and offer him big wages but after they cannot come up with the transfer request
267929 we were destabilised by some clubs who did not respect the fair play rule in tapping up players
267930 i think we suffered from that at the end of the season we havent done that but that has been done to us
267931 whilst i can fully understand the sense of frustration being felt by our supporters in the wake of what some perceive to be a moratorium with regard to the signing of new players i feel it is important to make a few points
267932 our attempts to complete the signings of players we believe will improve the quality of our first team squad continues on an hourly basis
267933 we have had a budget for incoming transfers since the start of the summer and that budget is in no way reliant or dependent upon either the proposed relocation of the club to kirkby or the sale of current players
267934 indeed any proceeds from outgoing transfers will you can rest assured be added to the existing budget to strengthen our managers hand as he seeks to enter the transfer market
267935 david and myself have been trying throughout the close season to sign those players whom he believes will help to improve the squad which achieved so much during the last campaign
267936 like everyone connected with everton football club i am desperately keen to see the arrival at goodison park of those players our manager would like to see in a blue shirt come next season
267937 i appreciate that waiting can be hard and that patience is invariably in short supply but we do expect to make signings before the opening of the new premier league season
267938 its hard to say exactly where we are compared to the opposition but clearly they are very quick
267939 i did not feel too comfortable on the softest tyre while on the harder one which i used first the situation was much better
267940 as usual on the first day at the hungaroring it is difficult to understand how the tyres are behaving because you always get a lot of graining while the situation changes bit by bit as more rubber goes down on the track surface
267941 we know in which direction we have to work and we will do all we can to bring home a good result it will be tough but i am confident all the same
267942 we worked on various set up options for the car

267946 it was very very disappointing and simply wasnt good enough unfortunately
267947 we have got that out of the way in the dressing room the disappointment in the dressing room was tangible
267948 what we saw today on friday was guys who were completely knackered the guys heads did drop slightly and we lost some energy
267949 we have a gift in the morning and that is the new ball it is up to us to make sure we use it right
267950 i havent scored the runs so far this season in test cricket so of course i felt under pressure
267951 not so much pressure from outside but pressure knowing that i havent contributed and i felt as though i have let the team down that is how i have felt these last few months so today friday was very special

267998 vera una fanciulla indossava un lungo maglione color della sabbia di lana fluente in molli onde lungo il corpo ed intessuto in trame preziose e splendidi nodi caldo e confortevole come quelli che le donne tessevano un tempo per i pescatori lunghe ciocche doro opaco erano adagiate sulle sue spalle sottili che in quella sera umida e fredda erano a malapena coperte dallesile rete di filo cardato di fronte a lei una vorace baia bianca inghiottiva loceano nero nero come nera era loscurit sopra di ella alle sue spalle pascoli verdi e feconde colline lasciata la casetta dal tetto di paglia ed i muri color latte ella affogava i suo pensieri nella notte densa pensava a qualcosa cosa non ha importanza so solo che dimprovviso sussurr un sorriso al mio cielo possedeva uno spirito felice poich poteva starsene lass da sola con la sua anima
267999 ricordo un assolato primo meriggio di molto tempo fa nascosta da un limpido cielo turchino vidi due bei giovani ed una ridente giovinetta passeggiare accaldati in un viale di aceri verdi sotto il sole cocente dopo lunghi e duri esami stanchi per il troppo ed arduo studio i libri gettati malamente nelle borse essi andavano cercando refrigerio fra le spire voluttuose di gelati al sapore di panna e dolce fragola in futuro assaporando simile delizia avrebbero rimembrato con lieve rimpianto il delizioso stato danimo la vecchia amicizia e quel sorso di libert goduto come fredda bevanda in un rovente giorno dinizio estate
268000 vidi un uomo una volta nel fiore degli anni e dai lunghi capelli neri come le piume di un corvo reale egli sedeva silente nella torre di un vecchio castello dalla finestra in vetri istoriati poteva ammirare le violette distese della terra della lavanda il profumo dei cespi fioriti saliva ad inebriare il mondo fino al mio cielo egli teneva fra le mani un libro di nobile foggia e da esso certo sgorgava il lume che dava lustro alle sue iridi color malva si nutriva di quel diletto e con esso il suo cuore ormai posseduto dal libro imprigionato fra guanciali di parole scritte sorrise con felice languore poich nella leggiadria del verso poetico egli aveva trovato lestasi dei sensi

268002 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law

268007 pakistans federally administered tribal areas fata are wilder than the wild west because al qaeda has resurfaced here in the form of a new breed of taliban who are threatening both afghanistan and pakistan
268008 like an arrow that has left the bow and flown wide of the mark jihad in the modern world has become a political weapon with which to threaten believers and unbelievers alike
268009 only by retrieving the arrow and straightening its jagged edges and twisted feathers can muslims aspire to attain those high ethical values which are the embodiment of faith iman based on submission to god islam
268010 u s pakistan relations have been difficult in the best of times
268011 they are today at a cross roads with grave consequences for the future course of the war on terror if losing afghanistan is out of the question for the usa and nato then it is vital to understand why losing pakistan is simply not an option if peace is to prevail in the world
268012 u s intelligence intercepted communications between pakistani spies and terrorists
268013 conclusion was based on intercepted communications between pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack
268014 i havent seen any evidence or proof that foreign agents were involved

268017 the mission of this cabinet is to implement concrete policies
268018 we must cope with rising energy costs a declining birth rate and an aging society
268019 the cabinet looks like more of the same but he wanted to strengthen his position in his party to stay on
268020 im not doing that i believe really believe it to be a sin
268021 recent incidents quite frankly have affected the future of the dialogue
268022 it the dialogue is in a place where it hasnt been in the last four years
268023 it was a jigsaw puzzle and we have some pieces in place
268024 both discussed that concrete steps in fighting terror were needed menon said adding that both heads of government agreed that if terrorism was not controlled neither country would profit from the rising economic tide in the region
268025 our investigation has definitely showed that we have local contact behind the blasts here
268026 whether its entirely local or there are outside elements influence here in the blasts its a matter of investigation which is yet to be firmed up
268027 we have come to the conclusion that these were professionally assembled bombs intended to cause damage
268028 for the first time i was verbally told by a politburo member that it was the decision of the party that i resign and vote against the motion when i refused subsequently it was suggested that i resign as speaker and not attend the house to cast my vote
268029 it will seriously compromise the constitutional position of the speaker
268030 the party should have appreciated that as speaker i did not represent it nor could it give any direction to me with regard to the discharge of my functions as speaker
268031 i reiterate this with all the emphasis at my command
268032 i could not and cannot in my conscience accept a position which would totally compromise the sanctity of the most important legislative office in the country
268033 after weighing the pros and cons i have consciously taken the principled decision to uphold the constitution of india at the risk of being unjustifiably dubbed as anti party
268034 in view of the controversies that are now being raised based on a partys contention that while as speaker a mp should continue to be under the direction and control of the party a convention should start now that during his tenure as speaker an mp should temporarily resign from the membership of the party and not face a situation which compromises the position of the speaker vis a vis his party
268035 the macro environment in the u s and the u s carrier spend continues to be challenging
268036 we really do live in a 24 7 society and its not uncommon to be online and checking email at all hours of the day
268037 sometimes we need to take a step back and refresh with an empty inbox or even a new inbox altogether to clear our mind and focus on those emails and relationships that are most important to us
268038 if you converse regularly bantering back and forth throughout the course of your workday its okay to leave out a salutation
268039 otherwise people can feel as though you didnt care enough to write out their name to really get someones attention the best thing you can do is call them by name
268040 at the end of the day its all about your image
268041 typos and poor grammar are the equivalent of walking into a room looking unshowered and disheveled good writing in an email shows you have both professionalism and class
268042 after the last water incident in my bathroom the plumbers left me with quite a mess i have a few areas that have no tiles at all now and would love to fix this up as it looks terrible and impossible to clean they dont have to be new in fact if i could find a place that had old ones it would probably match up better than new ones any thoughts thanks all

268169 i would not presume to pre empt a high court judges decision we dont need a municipal waste incinerator as cork county council will have ample capacity at its bottlehill landfill for the next 20 to 30 years
268170 that is way over capacity and it could lead to the importation of hazardous waste
268171 the toxic waste uncovered on haulbowline has proved a wake up call for cork harbour and has underlined a situation where the relevant authorities have failed to protect the community and the environment
268172 the primary objective of the project is to reduce the number of traffic accidents
268173 camera installation and construction at these intersections will be spread out over a period of time to minimize disruption of traffic flow

268221 we have tried very hard to minimize the impact but on the august 23 24 weekend it is particularly important for lirr customers to be aware of whats happening we want everyone who plans to ride the railroad that weekend to be ready to adjust their travel plans accordingly

268247 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
268248 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
268249 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step
268250 its seems like theyve been very very careful to differentiate wordscraper from scrabulous
268251 its almost as if they went line by line in the complaint and adjusted the game accordingly
268252 i think the wordscraper folks are on the right side of the issue its a close call but i think wordscrapper has done enough

268266 i can put up the latest interesting movie in adobe flash on my social page with malware embedded in it and if you access the movie but dont have the latest software patches ill be able to exploit you
268267 there probably should be regulations about the type of personal data that individuals could or should upload to sites like that
268268 presumably employees who work from home or at remote locations are transferring data behind the firewall from external sources
268269 exactly how much scanning of data goes on and what type of security policies are created to deal with that data are issues companies need to keep an eye on

268547 a competing vertically integrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players
268548 we also offer vertically integrated hardware and software products however efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce operating margins
268549 in the competition between pcs and macs we outsell apple 30 to 1 but there is no doubt that apple is thriving why because they are good at providing an experience that is narrow but complete while our commitment to choice often comes with some compromises to the end to end experience

268557 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
268558 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
268559 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
268560 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end

268566 the chapters of this book first appeared in the reformed church magazine 1893 1895 they then received favorable comment since that magazine ceased publication there have been so many inquiries for them that it is evident they met a felt want in the church and the sunday school board of the reformed church in the united states has undertaken their publication in this volume the author has added several chapters to those that appeared in the magazine it is hoped that the lives of these reformed saints will stimulate the ladies of our church to greater interest in our splended church history and to greater activity as in missions and the practical work of the church in which they already excel
268567 all in all this is a top notch collection which deserves and receives an unqualified recommendation

268615 hendrixs creative journey was cut short by an accidental overdose of sleeping pills
268616 will go down alongside james dean and river phoenix as great talents who were so cruelly taken away just as they started to show how damn good they were
268617 i tried living in the real world instead of a shell but i was bored before i even began
268618 let us cross over the river and rest under the shade of the trees
268619 joe was very much a great teacher and like so many other kids i was extremely lucky to have him
268620 but the speed playing that was so popular at the time just didnt move me the same way as the playing of say david gilmour or the edge
268621 the answer was something like you just dont do that and it made me think wait a minute
268622 this tuning reminds me of a lot of tambouras and other middle eastern instruments that are designed to sound great when strummed open instruments that sound just like chimes ringing in the wind
268623 the fun part and the challenge comes in finding other chords you can create a bridge and a chorus with using the same tuning
268624 another thing i dont like about standard tuning is that it makes it nearly impossible to play licks where you barre a chord with your 1st finger and play ornamental stuff with your other fretting fingers
268625 for instance open d frees up your fingers to do stuff like this ex 6 this is one of the riffs that really caught the ears of a amp r people when we were first shopping for a deal
268626 and the high f fretted with the 4th finger in those hammered on d chords is important too
268627 dont let it get lost because it adds a lot
268628 in general its very important to have strings gauged on the heavier side when youre messing around with open tunings
268629 i cant imagine playing with anything less than an 011 052 set i dont usually use a wound g but sometimes that helps when youre dropping that string down in pitch a fair amount heavier gauges also stay in tune better when youre really banging on the strings which ive always done because guitars just sound better when you hit em hard ive always liked that sense of reckless abandon you see towards the guitar from british players like the keith richards and even john lennon i like how there wasnt too much reverence for the instrument in that music at least not in the sense of traditional jazz or classical where theres a proper way to do things i mean my guitars get banged up
268630 its like trying to explain to someone why your marriage failed
268631 i dont have the occasion to go back and play these third eye blind riffs that often
268632 its painful its kind of like looking at a picture of a kid you lost custody of
268633 the first official slide backward since the last recession in 2001
268634 this is part of a systemic problem of the administration and i said im not going to take it anymore
268635 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
268636 what has happened is the supreme court found that the right to marriage includes same sex couples
268637 this happened after the original title was approved now same sex couples have a right thats recognized and supporters of the proposition want to eliminate that right
268638 cant say with a straight face that this isnt about eliminating the right to gay marriage so whats their problem with this this is a political lawsuit not one about serious legal issues
268639 i called you a creeper because you wouldnt just tell me your address
268640 negli stati uniti ogni anno in media muoiono 35 bambini dimenticati allinterno di auto infuocate questo il motivo che ha spinto la nostra societ a creare il child minder system alcune persone ha continuato jocelyn spears sostengono che un genitore con la testa sulle spalle non pu dimenticare il figlio in auto io so che levento pu accadere perch gli impegni quotidiani ci tengono molto occupati quando si stanchi facile distrarsi qualcuno dimentica di acquistare il latte un altro purtroppo dimentica il figlio in macchina

268645 nuestra intenci n es seguir con esta actitud y ser protagonistas en cualquier cancha en la que vayamos a jugar el equipo est adquiriendo esa mentalidad y no la vamos a cambiar
268646 va a ser un partido disputado para los dos am rica y toluca pero nosotros estamos muy bien y tengo mucha confianza en el equipo
268647 no s si voy a ser titular eso lo decide el t cnico pero creo que no hay otra opci n por la lesi n de palencia y por el caso de mart n sobre su pase es una responsabilidad muy grande ojal y se me den bien las cosas
268648 s que es un estadio muy chico parece que a la gente la tienes encima eso es v lido pero si hacemos un buen partido la presi n va a ser para ellos en ese sentido
268649 el calor afecta a los dos no creo que nada m s a nosotros tenemos un plantel que har un buen partido
268650 es que pumas ratifique el buen juego que hizo el domingo ante necaxa ahora ante un rival tan dif cil en su plaza como lo es santos laguna

268653 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
268654 es de los pocos temas hoy en d a que no me interesan pues esa persona eriksson hizo su lista como yo hago la m a y no me cuestionan que por qu no convoqu a tal o cual jugador pero no hablo de ese tema y no es que no vaya a apoyar al equipo pero es de m s inter s que tengo que pensar en pumas
268655 no me interesa mucho el tema la selecci n es una cosa que dejo a un lado le brindo mi apoyo pero no me interesa mucho me interesa m s este torneo el grupo en el que estamos y que el equipo vaya adelante y saque resultados
268656 no quiero distraerme ni perder mi tiempo en problemas que no valen la pena si llamaron a tal o cual jugador la verdad no vale la pena perder mi tiempo
268657 cuando vaya all va a trabajar y no hay problema lo mismo har cuando regrese y va a mejorar con un t cnico como eriksson y estando en la selecci n
268658 tiene nivel y ya no perdamos tiempo con estas babosadas

268662 todos son equipos que est n muy bien sus rivales de grupo y aqu es donde nosotros tenemos que demostrar para seguir avanzando y empezar a sumar de a tres en el grupo en el que estamos est muy apretado y hay que empezar a obtener unidades para no quedarnos atr s
268663 hay que mejorar en todo se puede todav a m s porque hay muy buenos jugadores para dar mucho m s pero eso va a ser con el paso del tiempo esperamos que en este partido contra atlas se pueda dar un avance
268664 creo que ellos est n muy bien tiene a muy buena gente arriba elementos con din mica pero va a ganar el que est mejor colocado y el que pueda meter las oportunidades de gol

268686 the fed will do nothing next week the fed will keep fed funds at 2 0 per cent voice its concern about the longer term inflation threats from commodity prices
268687 we know were in a soft economy perhaps its going to soften further over the next six months but there are not any crystal clear signals that were heading into a deep recession or anything nearing that
268688 for the federal reserve the news should reinforce a wait and see approach to policy
268689 despite the wage agreement it will take up to two more weeks before flight service is normalised
268690 this is an outcome that of course is not painless for either side
268691 but the fact that we were able to resolve the wage conflict internally sends an important message to our passengers and also to our staff and about germany as a place to do business
268692 in the end we reached an outcome that of course does not meet all of our colleagues expectations but that verdi can live with
268693 if you include the one off payment the wage agreement is higher than that in many manufacturing sectors
268694 compared to other service sector deals verdi is in the upper tier with this one

268700 if this was november we could approach this game in a more relaxed way but this is just the start and that makes it so much harder
268701 wherever we go it will one of the seasons most important matches
268702 i dont know them i havent seen them yet but whichever side it is well have to show them the utmost respect and be prudent we havent done much work while they have already played one round
268703 my job is to stop the players from relaxing against stronger teams you always have the advantage that the players are fully focused on the game
268704 my experience of playing the qualifying rounds three times with bar a is that they were all very difficult matches it is a good idea to take them as seriously and prudently as possible
268705 i want them to get the feeling that we are depending on ourselves and that we have to get things done properly i am happy with the way the team is working so far
268706 we gain a day to get over the jetlag which is perhaps the biggest worry i had we will have an extra day to recover and thats better for us

268722 the performance financial management cost control and reporting structures of health authorities
268723 we see great opportunities for patients to be even better served in the future with the changes that will occur as part of the restructuring
268724 the plan is to have one approach to health care that integrates health services across the province and standardizes care so that all patients receive the same quality of care
268725 these are people who have worked very hard on behalf of albertans and we recognize and thank them for their dedication and contribution to health service delivery
268726 these four senior people have proven over a long period that they understand the many different aspects of health care and have the ability to motivate and lead a team that can make a difference
268727 certainly we need all the clinical people we can get we currently have a shortage of available nurses and other professional health groups and that wont change with the new ahs
268728 recruiting and retaining top health care professionals will be a priority for the ahs
268729 i want to reassure all alberta that as we work through this restructuring the way you access care will not change
268730 removes artificial barriers that stand in the way of smooth delivery of health services
268731 i realize any change causes concerns this is especially true when you talk about health services
268732 our initiative is a work in progress we know it will change and evolve as we proceed

268741 it wasnt your fathers fault that he left you know i divorced him when the two of us got married your grandparents werent happy with the idea but they said okay they probably couldnt have stopped us anyway and they eventually came around to the idea that it was the right thing to do then baracks father your grandfather hussein wrote gramps this long nasty letter saying that he didnt approve of the marriage he didnt want the obama blood sullied by a white woman he said well you can imagine how gramps reacted to that and then there was a problem with your fathers first wife he had told me they were separated but it was a village wedding so there was no legal document that could show a divorce
268742 the old man began to drink heavily and many of the people he knew stopped coming to visit because now it was dangerous to be seen with him they told him that maybe if he apologized changed his attitude he would be all right but he refused and continued to say whatever was on his mind
268743 i understood most of this only when i was older
268744 she left when i was twelve or thirteen after the old man had had a serious car accident
268745 because of the accident the old man had now lost his job at the water department and we had no place to live
268746 it was worse between him and roy they would have terrific fights finally roy just left he just stopped coming home and started living with different people so i was left alone with the old man sometimes i would stay up half the night waiting to hear him come through the door worrying that something terrible had happened then he would stagger in drunk and come into my room and wake me because he wanted company or something to eat
268747 its nice to see my mom and dad of course and joey hes really a great kid
268748 as for the rest of kenya i dont feel much of an attachment just another poor african country

268751 you think that somehow im cut off from my roots that sort of thing
268752 well youre right at a certain point i made a decision not to think about who my real father was he was dead to me even when he was still alive i knew that he was a drunk and showed no concern for his wife or children that was enough
268753 we have one son we dont want a big family with two or more children

269110 we are extremely honored to have tekkonkinkreet black amp white recognized by the comics industry with this notable award
269111 taiyo matsumoto has won international critical acclaim for his honest and unflinching depictions of young peoples lives and for his unique immediately recognizable art style that blends both japanese and european influences we invite everyone to explore this award winning series now available in a gorgeous omnibus edition from viz media
269112 to bring the new negima manga to the u s is a big thrill for us and were very excited about all of our releases this span the manga were publishing are getting better and better all the time
269113 clamp was one of the greatest influences in the creation of the manga market in america and its past time we took a closer look at how and why that happened
269114 on behalf of del rey manga im proud to be publishing this book and for the opportunity to work closely with clamp again

269117 massachusetts will then be the place instead of california where homosexual couples fly to
269118 this year just so happens to be one of the bigger years in terms of numbers of irish
269119 individually the irish have been very respectful and understanding when we approach them for a crime they have all been incredibly nice individuals
269120 as a group they party until beyond the wee hours of the night they drink excessively and they either do not have an understanding or care about our laws here they will claim ignorance and then try to hide their beer
269121 for example in vegas you only care about yourself and that has a negative impact on the town and community
269122 we are getting complaints every night about the irish living in the breakpointe and coronado apartments
269123 we get music complaints and other disturbing the peace complaints on a daily basis unfortunately because 500 people live at breakpointe it draws resources from the ucpd and the goleta police to help deal with these situations of complex parties its more than we can handle
269124 we decline to comment about anything related to our tenants
269125 would be charged rent everyday that the keys were not returned
269126 i came to iv this summer to meet americans my age
269127 instead all i have met are irish they are everywhere im staying in the breakpointe apartments and they are everywhere
269128 friday and saturday nights have been quieter during the past summers and we attribute the rise this year to two reasons one of which being the irish
269129 two we assume that more ucsb students are taking summer school classes to get back off the five and six year plans
269130 right now weve spent a month trying to deal with the irish but they are on three month visas
269131 we arrest them issue warnings and enact the same no tolerance polices as we do with all other violators in the area but then they leave and these measures are still not having an impact this is why we are not trying to address the management companies they have the responsibility to respect the yearlong tenants
269132 many of us are staying here until october some even as early as september
269133 here i cant even go out to the bars because im only 20 years old
269134 its weird because ive been going to bars since i was 17 back in ireland so many of us dont have any other place to go and party so we just say f k it lets get smashed at home
269135 i have had many encounters with irish kids this summer but most of them have been civil and interesting
269136 two irish kids rolled up to my house and we got into a 45 minute conversation about politics they told me it was the best conversation theyve had since they got here
269137 this summer there is a little more activity in containing the irish
269138 regarding the city every year it sees if the influx of irish has grown there are definitely more irish here than there have been in the past and thats what weve been encountering
269139 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and this final decision is in the best interest of our program
269140 we outlined for josh the expectations we had for him when he arrived and unfortunately those expectations have not been met josh needs to learn from this experience we hope he can move forward in a positive manner
269141 this is not my preferred way to roll out anything
269142 but when things start leaking and then the stories say that we are hiding something which were not only not hiding but were scrambling to get out there its a bit unfair its a bit crazy
269143 frankly as rollouts go i so would have liked to see this go way differently and way better
269144 human health in a changing climate a canadian assessment of vulnerabilities and adaptive capacity
269145 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
269146 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
269147 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
269148 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
269149 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
269150 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
269151 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
269152 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
269153 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
269154 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
269155 were thrilled to be able to feature these pictures in people
269156 n o sabemos quem ele ele n o deve ser da cidade pois ningu m se identificou como amigo ou parente dele

269158 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians
269159 six years in sodom from the journal of james hartline
269160 but im straight how does this affect me why should i care
269161 what happens to the couples already married if prop 8 passes
269162 pastors and churches will be silenced from speaking publicly against homosexuality
269163 will any churches synagogues or other houses of worship be forced to marry same sex couples if prop 8 loses
269164 five years from today youre going to be the same person making the same money except for the books you read and the people you meet
269165 i was the head of theater at camp winnebago for four proud summers and may have been the first person to mount a version of grease two im just saying ive been in plays and shows on the side all my life and before blogging i was doing a little sketch comedy stuff nothing major and i was in a musical comedy weekly current events show in the summer of 05 for me the most fun is to perform something ive written like in law school the highlight of the year was law follies
269166 despite everything this is a good day for turkey and for europe
269167 there is a vast majority among the turkish people who are in favour of european values im sure this played a role
269168 turkey is living a tense situation and we very much hope that the decision by the court will contribute to restore political stability
269169 it is not a decision to close down the party but it is a serious warning
269170 i hope the party in question will evaluate this outcome very carefully and grasp the message intended
269171 the justice and development party which has never been a focal point of anti secular activities will continue to defend the basic principles of the republic
269172 court cases to close political parties are not normal in eu democracies
269173 i encourage turkey now to resume with full energy its reforms to modernise the country
269174 the relevant parties should work towards sustainable reforms based on a consensus forged through a broad based dialogue with all sections of turkish society
269175 alignment of turkeys rules on political parties with european standards is essential
269176 it is a step forward for parliamentary democracy in turkey
269177 this implies that accession negotiations between turkey and the eu can continue
269178 bt has continued to grow revenue earnings ebitda and earnings per share in the first quarter
269179 our full year guidance remains unchanged we continue to expect to deliver growth in revenue ebitda earnings per share and dividends per share in this financial year
269180 wholesale has been under pressure for some time but such a big drop in one quarter is pretty dramatic
269181 the scale of fall in value is more of a market response to being surprised than a reflection of what is happening in the business
269182 if the economic climate cools off then we need to discuss measures this autumn that could reinforce growth
269183 certainly it is crucial to develop this region but we must always take into consideration the impact on the environment if we want development to last
269184 awards are nice but the real satisfaction is knowing the vaccine is back on line
269185 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats actions plans
269186 he always seemed on the edge the kind of guy who might jump through the ceiling if you said boo to him
269187 the trend in declining demand continues not just in the state but on a national level
269188 it comes down to high gasoline prices the slowing economy people finding alternate routes to travel and a growing demand for vehicles that are more efficient in their fuel use
269189 we have been concerned about capital raising and returns on capital and this change may lead to a reduction in scope or cancellation
269190 indicates the unprecedented downturn that las vegas is currently undergoing and the extreme difficulty in securing capital
269191 we continue to believe that the downturn should continue throughout the remainder of 2008 and into 2009
269192 while this past quarters results reveal both birth pangs and significant economic primarily las vegas and competitive primarily macau pressures these should normalize over time
269193 long term we are well aware of the many opportunities las vegas sands has albeit at this point we are convinced the concerns overshadow the potentials
269194 weve seen these types of worms before typically around myspace
269195 people are more trusting of things they receive from a friend

269236 i discussed this with the national epilepsy society to confirm that
269237 studies from belgium germany and spain show there is hideous damage to birdlife and wildlife
269238 the tribunal found that the nuisance caused by the wind farm was real and not imagined and it would have an effect on the sale price of the appeal dwelling
269239 it means many families in scotland living in the shadow of giant turbines could see thousands wiped off the value of their homes as the government pushes ahead with plans to build thousands more onshore wind turbines over the next decade to meet ambitious green targets
269240 jane davis came up in september last year and gave a moving presentation in auchtermuchty village hall on the subject of the intrusive damaging and unpredictable noise from wind turbines
269241 since then she has been continuing in her own campaign and supporting others in the quest to have a safe buffer zone between wind turbines and dwellings
269242 scottish planning policy 6 sets out a distance of two kilometres from a village but ignores the substantial number of dwellings that could be in that zone but not in a village
269243 the effect on property prices is obvious and people should not be selectively economically disadvantaged in this way there are about 30 properties within one kilometre of the energiekontor site near ceres
269244 there will be lots of information on the plans at the meeting we are also hoping more residents will come forward to join stop and help with the campaign
269245 people are beginning to realise we need to do something about energy generation before it is too late
269246 im all for renewable energy but these valleys have suffered enough
269247 we dont take second best here and we dont want these turbines
269248 we are delighted because we would have taken it to appeal otherwise as it ticks all the boxes in terms of planning policy so this decision has saved a lot of time and money
269249 it just goes to show that people are becoming more aware of climate change and energy prices which affects us all
269250 following a local election how can a decision arrived at by a democratically elected body be overturned by new members
269251 one councillor said no statutory body had objected to this development but bridgend county borough council maintained its opposition
269252 coun roger turner of the brynna ward said there had been no opposition to the proposed industrial wind turbine development and the vast majority of people in the brynna area supported the scheme
269253 he based this assumption on the signatures of about 200 people which is either a very brave or reckless thing to do only time will tell
269254 on a windy day it makes more power than we need and it turns our electric meter backward
269255 on days its not windy we use up our credit
269256 last year we were probably getting a call a week or every two weeks
269257 when youre buying a renewable energy system youre hedging future cost increases
269258 at the same time youre pre buying renewable energy for 30 40 years
269259 but if we create the situation where individuals can do this and make it easier for them then this will ultimately reduce our dependency on power produced by fossil fuel
269260 i think theres still a lot of misconceptions around wind turbines and a fair amount of public resistance to them
269261 a lot of people think of solar energy when they think of producing energy at home but this is just another alternative
269262 we had some concerns about it because theres an effort by the state to limit towns ability to exercise their zoning power

269267 this windfarm is too big it will scar and overwhelm the local landscape it only got the go ahead because it is not in an snp constituency
269268 it is a political decision of the worst kind and one that is to be regretted i am disappointed particularly for everyone involved in the campaign against it
269269 we are about to see beginning is a massive construction project which is equivalent to the m74 motorway so i do hope that some local benefit will come out of that but obviously that is at a cost
269270 there will be inconvenience to communities affected by the access to the construction sites such as moffat
269271 it would be a tremendous step forward to provide a more reliable robust system to serve the entire electric industry not just wind
269272 im not aware of any utility thats building a transmission line that doesnt on occasion need to make use of such a tool
269273 first step in providing the federal government siting authority that supplements existing state authority

269294 the last time congress imposed a form of the windfall tax was the final gloomy days of jimmy carter and the result was a substantial reduction in domestic oil production about 5 thus raising the price of gas at the pump and a 10 increase in u s reliance on foreign oil a windfall profits tax is the ultimate act of economic masochism because it taxes only domestic production while imports and foreign oil subsidiaries bear almost none of the cost

269305 its really one of the few issues they can hold against her
269306 i wouldnt worry about a republican winning the 13th district
269307 its a very safe democratic district and incumbents usually win
269308 when you have these entrenched incumbents in safe districts they are rarely held accountable for their actions this is a rare opportunity for voters
269309 kilpatrick is generally right on the issues including her commitment to get u s forces out of iraq and focus federal dollars on domestic needs kilpatrick is well positioned to secure federal support for transit and homeland security projects in the region
269310 in a three way race you have to be closer to majority support for it to mean anything
269311 one opponent would be easier to deal with it would be easier to secure a majority
269312 with two opponents one opponent could get a third and the other almost a third and kilpatrick could lose thats just the math of it
269313 of course it would be easier for kilpatrick to win against two candidates
269314 the challenge we have is the on the ground get out the vote operation
269315 unless there is a huge effort put forth kilpatrick will win in november

269456 the npp chairman the mce were seen with a group of six npp people went to the centre fired warning shots into the air to frighten the people away took some of the registration forms scattered many on the ground and went away
269457 i have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the information given to me by my sources

269459 the idea came to me but i had no mechanism for sharing it with people at least i did have mechanisms but they were one to one mechanisms and the thing never got any traction but now with the whole web 2 0 thing one person can have an idea and gather other people around that idea very very easily
269460 before the facebook group i was getting nowhere at all the group has changed everything and is the reason weve made such rapid progress continuing support for the idea is vital if we are to turn this idea into a reality and actually save some lives

269484 ruth coleman and allen baylis agree that nude sunbathing along the southernmost stretch of san onofre state beach has attracted people who boink in public
269485 they claim there are x number of citations for lewd conduct but they dont say where they were given on the beach or in the parking lot it makes a difference
269486 t herefore it shall be the policy of the department that enforcement of nude sunbathing regulations within the state park system shall be made only upon the complaint of a private citizen
269487 stems from the increase in verbal complaints from the public about nudity in general on a public beach and the public not wanting to be exposed to it
269488 verbal complaints are not worth the paper they are written on
269489 thats just bad government the parks department is acting like a typical bully government agency

269508 i think its very much playing the race card to put a highly educated articulate middle aged black family man into a television commercial with two blonde bimbo airheads with a combined i q of a box of cereal and if you have any doubts about what im talking about its the same kind of thing that was done to harold ford down in tennessee in 2006 and it stinks its more subtle but it stinks just the same
269509 you know look thats a stretch theres going to be a lot of time in this campaign to dissect whether something is racist or not it is too early for these kind of shenanigans this is this is ridiculous when there are legitimate claims of racism you know this is like crying wolf lets put it into perspective here it was a light hearted ad that obama himself reacted to in a light hearted manner
269510 there was nothing making light about it there was nothing funny about that commercial go watch the harold ford stuff

269521 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
269522 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
269523 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
269524 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
269525 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
269526 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
269527 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
269528 we all cross bridges and im not talking about metaphors

269531 i think that my dad can help me now more than he ever could before
269532 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
269533 he was not with the ideology of usama bin laden and people like him he was only searching for pleasure and money in this life
269534 he is intending to invoke self incrimination rights and not appear
269535 he says he killed her alone but had help transporting the body parts
269536 he has been charged will be formally indicted and may face 30 years

269538 we wish this wasnt the big issue because there are bigger ones but we cant now avoid it
269539 confidence in the validity of the anglican communion is severely damaged
269540 bishops cannot be a symbol of unity when their consecration itself divided the church
269541 i see a great wall being put up by revisionists against those orthodox who believe in the authority of scripture i am shocked to say that we are finding it very hard to come together on even the essentials of the faith we once received from the apostles
269542 everywhere we go we meet gay and lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their many events
269543 they push all these sexuality issues so intensively into the conference and then blame us for talking about them too much
269544 in the attitude of some north american churches i am reminded of the arrogance of the american administration that made a mess in iraq because it refused to listen to the millions of voices from the wider world
269545 we think that any centralisation of power will take us away from historic anglicanism
269546 the main reason for their enmity with this nation in the past 30 years is that they want to force the iranian nation to retreat
269547 whenever the enemies have failed against this nation they have tried to make excuses but the iranian nation will stand against them with its power

269578 brandon has really benefited going all the way back to training camp last year from all of the reps he was able to get at a young age
269579 i think now he probably chuckles at that experience because everything came so fast for him and he was thrown into a situation where he was not able to probably learn our offense in a progression like most young guys i think we are now seeing the benefits of it
269580 it was just like bullets coming and i was dodging and ducking
269581 i was a rookie coming in and had a lot thrown at me i handled it well and got out there it wasnt the best that i could give but this year i am more ready for it
269582 it was great for me to go out there and show everybody and myself that i could do it that i could get the job done
269583 it has brought a lot of momentum to this year and this camp and im just trying to keep it going
269584 he never played special teams until almost the end of last year
269585 i think hes definitely going to be a factor as we move forward as a core player there
269586 i felt like i wanted to do it so it could help me stay healthy and with my blocking
269587 i still have the burst when i put on the weight i run a lot more and just make sure that my speed is still up you know when you are out there if you are in shape or not and if the weight is slowing you down or not
269588 hes a guy that i think has made some progression physically in terms of his strength explosiveness and quickness
269589 hes also just operating a little bit more like a pro football player more like youd want him to be hes very professional in his approach
269590 i wasnt at the pass rush drill the other day against the linebackers but when you watch this kid hes got some quickness hes got a real good lower body so we think hes got a little bit of power in him even though youre not going to look at him and say hes the big massive individual
269591 last year i was a little rushed and was just getting out too soon
269592 i would get out quicker than the guards did on the screen so i had to slow down and be patient
269593 right now i am just going out and playing football and having fun

269603 we dont like minnesota around these parts but tom at gopher nation is one of the few exceptions
269604 grab the children and protect the wives here comes gopher nation
269605 thank you to the gn for talking me down from the ledge this morning with your words
269606 were healthy we had a good crowd its a beautiful day its just a good day to be a baylor bear no doubt
269607 i like our football team we just need to stay hungry like we are now and thats our job as coaches to keep them there i like people that want to prove something we are a team that needs to prove something so i like that part of it
269608 offensive line is the key right now weve got three players that we believe in a whole lot and weve got to find two other guys to jump in there with them we get five offensive linemen that can play and we will be a good football team
269609 if i can kind of rally the guys behind me both this summer and going into fall camp then well be in good shape
269610 as we keep going its going to be a pretty powerful thing
269611 it just really puts a stretch on the defense i mean the challenge is on its kind of an offensive explosion right now and youve got to be able to keep up with it
269612 on defense were going to be special if we can bear down and do what were supposed to do and stay in our gaps we can be a special defense
269613 putting six seven eight punts and kicks on the ground every year
269614 i feel athletically we are still a little bit off where we need to be we need to put together solid recruiting classes over and over and then you eventually claw your way to being competitive with some of the upper echelon teams in this league
269615 this is where bonding starts in many many ways before the season starts what kind of and how much production you get in summer workouts
269616 we are just trying not to get complacent and know that we have to work hard to get where we were last year
269617 we are not even talking about last year because it is a new year we just have to rebuild
269618 things arent just going to happen for us we have to show up and make them happen we learned that from last year the orange bowl doesnt mean anything this season we have the players that we need to have a great season but we just need to make it happen
269619 were really embarrassed by the end of last season but were definitely hungry on what we want to do this year coach ron prince is just trying to make sure that we dont get too full of ourselves
269620 its a process youve got to win the north then youve got to win the big 12 championship if you can do that and get on a roll then maybe youre in the hunt but we will never here just focus on the top of the pyramid
269621 last year we did some pretty good things but we didnt do enough
269622 i think this team can get to that next level
269623 not only do we have the talent to win the national title weve got the mindset to do so within the team we know what we want and what were going to do to get it
269624 what i see defensively is theyre starting to learn the concepts and principles of what were asking them to do and the roles
269625 a lot of thats new to them as far as the development and understanding of it its coming but its not there
269626 bo pelini is one of the most dominating leaders ive ever ever witnessed the guy imposes his will on everything and this defense is no different they feel it they feel him
269627 he needs to learn to just level and run but hes a very good back and hes doing well for a young guy hes really doing well
269628 hes a guy not everybody has really had a chance to see a lot of i made this comment to a lot of people mossis madu can play for a lot of people
269629 im fortunate to be a coach at a position that has a lot of depth
269630 ive got another couple months before i can really start sprinting hard
269631 but its getting a lot better i dont feel any pain in my knee so rehabs going great for me so far
269632 i think we gained experience in the areas we needed it i thought our secondary was outstanding all spring which was something that needed to happen for our team to be solid this year it may have been as consistent and as solid a spring as weve had in the secondary
269633 i want to get as many at bats as they do
269634 i dont want anyone having more snaps than we do
269635 we open up holes for the linebackers or pass rush for the secondary defensive lines carry the defense
269636 its really hard for me to predict how much better until we start playing in september but i do feel were better from a depth standpoint from a toughness standpoint and were faster
269637 i think swanson miller has gotten in shape and has played better
269638 i like his aggressiveness and how he runs to the football once jeremiah develops more in the weight room i think he will be a decent pass rusher maurice made some great strides in the last 6 8 practices and antoine really brings some intensity to our defense
269639 ive seen a lot of progress and im proud of how were playing
269640 theyre buying into the system were taking baby steps were tackling better getting off blocks better i like the effort and the enthusiasm
269641 i dont think theres any question were going to be better on defense we have more depth they understand the system better the addition of the mid term guys at this point has worked out well for us but well find out in september how good we are
269642 some will play earlier than that and i think they all should be a factor by the middle of the year
269643 we have a lot of backs that can make a lot of explosive plays
269644 you dont replace a guy that runs 10 2 in the 100 you just dont do it you miss that type of speed but backs are all different each back has his strengths
269645 i thought vondrell did some good things and fozzy has had a great spring and really looked good
269646 right now those three guys would still be competing in the fall to see who will step up what were trying to do is see attitude effort and toughness and see who can make the individual plays
269647 if youre not doing what youre supposed to do hes not going to play you if you dont hustle but hell be the first one to pat you on the back and jump up and chest bump you if you do something well ive really been impressed you cant be hard on them all the time and hes got the great balance of both and the kids have really bought into him
269648 weve got to be able to generate pressure with four guys rushing
269649 and to me being on time is a matter of respect respecting your teammates and your coaches you dont walk in late
269650 just the way he takes care of business he gets everybody to buy in and make sure they are doing what they are supposed to do
269651 if you can find a fit whether its college or the pros its about getting your guys to go beat someone elses guys consistently i feel like we can do that here
269652 we have a chance to be good on defense if we build from this point
269653 but if we have to spend two weeks getting to this point when we get to practice in the fall we havent accomplished as much as we hope this needs to be our next starting point
269654 we have so much talent its ridiculous and then we have so much depth behind everybody whos starting we play with a lot more confidence and when you have a lot more confidence you can play a lot more excited
269655 independence was my obsession when i was 20 it was not making money it was making my own money modeling meant i did not have to rely on my parents or a man
269656 i learned how other people lived i was trying to speak other languages
269657 modeling has a reputation for emptiness but its not it is certainly not german philosophy but it was very instructive because it was made up of real life you travel you are always alone and you better be well grounded because its easy to lose yourself
269658 this legislation proves it is easy to be green the green act will help revitalize our economy by making energy efficiency practices more affordable accessible and achievable by consumers businesses and government entities by prioritizing energy efficiency practices we can ease the woes of homeowners lenders financial markets builders and our environment
269659 i look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this measure through the full house in september in order to save green we must go g r e e n this bill is another tool to move our country toward energy conservation our infrastructure is old and when renovation or rehabilitation efforts commence we must take the opportunity to use current technologies and standards to develop healthier more sustainable neighborhoods
269660 at 2 and 3 they muslims begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs
269661 from 5 on they muslims exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population
269662 at this point they muslims will work to get the ruling government to allow them to rule themselves under sharia or islamic law the ultimate goal of islam is not to convert the world but to establish sharia law over the entire world
269663 when muslims reach 10 of the population they will increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions paris riots killings hundreds of cars burned any non muslim action that offends islam will result in uprisings and threats amsterdam denmark mohammed cartoons murder of theo van gogh
269664 after reaching 20 of a population expect hair trigger rioting jihad militia formations sporadic killings and church and synagogue burning
269665 after 40 you will find widespread massacres chronic terror attacks and ongoing militia and muslim terrorist warfare
269666 from 60 you may expect unfettered persecution of non believers and other religions sporadic ethnic cleansing genocide use of sharia law as a weapon and jizya the tax placed on conquered infidels
269667 100 will usher in the peace of dar es salaam the islamic house of peace more correctly dar al islam or land of islam there is supposed to be peace because everybody is a muslim
269668 of course thats not the case to satisfy their blood lust muslims then start killing each other for a variety of reasons
269669 before i was nine i had learned the basic canon of arab life it was me against my brother me and my brother against our father my family against my cousins and the clan the clan against the tribe and the tribe against the world and all of us against the infidel leon uris the haj
269670 it is good to remember that in many many countries such as france the muslim populations are centered around ghettos based on their ethnicity muslims do not integrate into the community at large therefore they exercise more power than their national average s would indicate

269682 many times ive been stuck in traffic on route 8 and it gets very very congested and it causes accidents and backups
269683 im not sure if its going to help with traffic so much because most people just use this for their enjoyment
269684 depending on how good the road system is perhaps it will alleviate some of the traffic
269685 i think that would be great they have the high rock trail for hikers i like mountain biking myself

269701 this new identity gives me new potential as i face the realities of life in this bent and broken world

269715 reduce the work of the human body living labor to a simple element of this process the conscious organ the observing eye that serves to avoid interruption
269716 the liberation of human labor from factory production a condition that was intuited by marx and that today is becoming real before our very eyes seems to bring about a mutation of common affect and sentiments a different deployment of common sense a semantic alteration of key words for daily life words such as time truth and memory
269717 the advent of the computer finally introduces a time that escapes the very possibility of experience the machine can carry out and write out calculations in a time so short that it cannot be captured in thought
269718 time unveils itself to be a linguistic convention a verbal construction not a fixed quality of reality
269719 corresponding to this final completion to this touching of the limit is a leap of human awareness a different way of conceiving the relation between the human and the natural
269720 the mnemotechnic obsession of oral culture lost its meaning and narration ceased to hold hegemony over transmittable knowledge
269721 with the advent of writing memory detaches itself from the individual as it does from the community knowledge is congealed in written words it is there available consultable and comparable this sort of objective memory disjoins knowledge from the individual or collective corporeity knowledge is no longer what nurtures the human being what forms it as part of a given linguistic community it has become an analyzable criticizable and verifiable object the need for truth is a collateral effect of the partial necrosis of corporeal memory
269722 the central aim of information knowledge is not the completeness and coherence of facts and judgements on the world but rather the optimization of procedures be they for decisions diagnosis management or planning information knowledge incessantly transforms procedures so that the action may be more effective and above all faster
269723 here knowledge is no longer congealed in writing on the contrary it is possessed by an incessant movement changing continuously so as always to be current and ready for use here memory is so entrusted to automatic devices so much object of manipulation and elaboration so extraneous to the bodies of individuals and collective habits as to merit another name another meaning
269724 information knowledge is this free from the human activity of remembering truth can cease to be the fundamental aim of knowledge in favor of operativeness and speed

269732 many physician scientists drop out of research during their first few years in the field discouraged by failed grant applications or the lack of time to focus on their research

269759 his eyes filled with tears and he took a very deep breath
269760 he is overwhelmed and extremely relieved by the verdict having spent eight years in prison he is looking forward to being a free man again
269761 the great tragedy is that a man has spent eight years wrongly imprisoned and also that jill dandos family no longer has anyone in prison who committed that crime
269762 compensation is certainly something we will be looking at i would be surprised if there wasnt a claim for compensation for the eight years he has suffered in prison
269763 he now has to come to terms and make some important adjustments in his life and he will need to rebuild his life in the community
269764 we are really delighted to finally have justice we have been fighting for many years now we need time to get back together as a family we also hope that the police will now look again into the murder of jill dando
269765 ive always felt deeply concerned about the verdict that was reached and deeply concerned that somebody had been put in prison for life that possibly hadnt committed this crime i have to say theres never been a time ive not thought about it its always worried me greatly
269766 he was below me and suddenly he jumped up and pounced on me from behind
269767 he didnt say anything he just pinned me in the corner pulling my arm up my back i was screaming for my life but no one heard he put his hand over my nose and mouth and i couldnt breathe i thought i was going to die he was desperately trying to shut me up he had gargantuan strength im five foot eight well built and fit but i couldnt fight him off
269768 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends however we respect the decision of the court
269769 the investigation into her murder was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered
269770 it would not be appropriate to comment any further at this time except to say that we will be reflecting upon todays verdict and considering how best to proceed
269771 mr george now has the right be regarded as an innocent man but that does not mean it was wrong to bring the case the fact that the trial ran its full course confirms that although it has changed in detail the circumstantial evidence which has been tested over and over again by the courts was judged fit to be put before a jury
269772 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
269773 he has a lot of friends and they are all very upset hes gone and they would like to say they miss him and he will always be in their hearts
269774 it seemed like they were more interested in going to lunch than hearing from shareholders
269775 at no point did this board or management in any way ever resist microsofts proposal

269790 if you want to put salt on your fish and chips and there are only four holes youre just going to spend longer putting more on

269792 health professionals suggest that we should limit our salt intake to 6g a day but estimate that most people consume approximately 9g
269793 following discussions the ioc has held with the organizers of the on the difficulties experienced this week in accessing some web sites the ioc is pleased to see that the issues are quickly being resolved
269794 the media should be seeing a noticeable difference in accessibility to web sites that they need to report on the olympic games
269795 this access has always been assured by bocog the and the chinese authorities and the ioc is pleased to see these are assurances being upheld
269796 this is good news of course but it continues to be unacceptable that the chinese government can decide according to its mood which web sites are censored and which are accessible
269797 and how long will these sites be available to the 253 million chinese internet users who continue to be subject to massive online censorship
269798 from a wrestling standpoint this show blows away anything from the big groups in several months
269799 the roh tag team bout between champs age of the fall and challengers bryan danielson amp austin aries is worth the 10 price tag alone the fight without honor between strong and stevens is a fitting end to their feud with the blow off grudge match we rarely see in the realm of sports entertainment from top to bottom if you want athletics in your wrestling you want roh who start their second year of ppvs the same as their first with a wrestling ppv focused on great wrestling
269800 i highly recommend this ppv when it premiers this friday on ppv you wont get more value for your dollar than you do with roh ppvs stevens and black are really stepping up and becoming must see performers in the company their performances on this show are the highlights of the ppv the production on this show was fantastic by roh standards as well
269801 he said look ive got to get up im going to walk out of here
269802 he just said it felt like everything was in slow motion and it felt like he was in the air for eight seconds
269803 if he landed at the bottom he had a better chance of getting the rotation he was perfect but he thought he wasnt
269804 that second rotation was the longest second of my entire life

269816 mindless u s support of a regime that tacitly allowed paramilitary groups to function should not be applauded nor should the hundreds of trade union leaders that have been murdered during the uribe presidency be forgotten
269817 i would like to see our continued assistance to countries like colombia and mexico we have just reached an agreement with mexico to try to do what is best for america and that would be to stem the flow of cocaine
269818 i have always said that all options are on the table but the first option for the united states is to solve this problem diplomatically ive also made it clear that you cant solve a problem diplomatically unless there are other people at the table with you and that is why we have been pursuing multilateral diplomacy when it comes to convincing the iranians that the free world is sincere about you know insisting that they not have the technologies necessary to develop a nuclear weapon and were making progress along those lines

269904 the former ambassador jan wijenberg said this is by no means an isolated incident but part of a long term strategy to demolish palestinian social economic and cultural life i am aware of the possibility that mohammed omer might be murdered by israeli snipers or bomb attack in the near future

269907 the goal is to end the presence of foreign troops
269908 rather than a breakthrough the g8s announcement on 2050 is another stalling tactic that does nothing to lower the risk faced by millions of poor people right now
269909 the world faces three simultaneous crises a food crisis a climate crisis and a development crisis the three crises are deeply interconnected and need to be addressed as such
269910 now the bush administrations new policy is to wait another ten years
269911 he loved the picture dont get me wrong but he just couldnt get over the war he wasnt joseph anymore joseph never came home
269912 i just feel this war has become so sanitized that it was important to show
269913 provided the enemy with specific information on the effectiveness of the attack
269914 france is one of the ten countries in the world with the highest number of endangered species mainly due to what has happened in its overseas territories and once again the risk of these numbers increasing in the european overseas territories is likely to increase with the growing threat of climate change
269915 the ticket was for trespassing he said if i came back into the plaza i would be arrested and taken to jail the sign says mccain bush now in a republican event why is that offensive why would republicans who voted for bush find it offensive that a sign says bush mccain or mccain bush

269927 alright you know what we wont come in there at the high rates we dont want to get on the radar screen in that respect well just come right under and well start to look for ways to make loans with lots of bells and whistles and lots of fees attached to them where we can come under the radar screen and start to create this kind of market of potential problems
269928 you know what if lenders go outside of their responsibilities they can be sued they can have to pay out they can lose certain amounts of money that they have counted on

269933 i believe the man we need to meet the mortal need today is here he is experienced but has not lost his common sense or his ability to be outraged his conservatism is not the result of a studied philosophy but of common sense and personal observation his name is john mccain he might not be the right president for all times but he is the right president for these times
269934 well we cant let bear stearns fail because then all these people will lose their jobs and well have a domino effect

269951 though the chinese have also recently begun investing in the countrys oil sector u s companies exxonmobil amerada hess chevron texaco and marathon oil have played the most significant role a report by the international monetary fund notes that u s oil companies receive by far the most generous tax and profit sharing provisions in the region congressional hearings recently revealed how u s oil companies paid hundreds of millions of dollars destined to state treasuries directly into the dictators private bank accounts a senate report faulted u s oil companies for making substantial payments to or entering into business ventures with government officials and their family members
269952 the irony of the relative silence of congress and the bush administration regarding the human rights abuses and the undemocratic nature of obiangs regime is that due to the critical role of u s economic investment and security assistance the united states has far more leverage over the government of equatorial guinea than it does over zimbabwe
269953 equatorial guinea receives u s government funding and training through imet which is international military education and training program in addition the private u s firm military professional resources incorporated mpri founded by former senior pentagon officials who cite the regimes friendliness to u s strategic and economic interests plays a key role in the countrys internal security apparatus

269965 irans will and authority to the enemies that have threatened iran with harsh language in recent weeks
269966 we face with the iranians and so do our allies and friends a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology as to this point is still unchecked and its hard for me to believe that an american president is not going to want to have the capability to defend our territory the territory of our allies whether they are in europe or whether they are in the middle east
269967 this is not good for our republic nor for europe nor for peace and security all around the world people are against the radar for different reasons radar and missiles have no security nor defensive reasoning
269968 every military action causes a military response this is the fundamental rule this is what military people are about if there is a military action if there is a change in strategic posture there is a counter change of strategic posture you can read it in every military textbook so there is nothing surprising there are not even questions to be asked about
269969 we cant have a memorandum of understanding with foreign forces unless it has dates and clear horizons determining the departure of foreign forces were unambiguously talking about their departure we are waiting impatiently for the day when the last foreign soldier leaves iraq
269970 we have great confidence that the political leadership in iraq would not take an action that would destabilize the country
269971 let me first of all talk about the broader issue this whole notion that i am shifting to the center or that im flip flopping or this or that or the other you know the people who say this apparently havent been listening to me ive been organizing with churches for years in the community and so the notion that somehow thats me trying to look like im you know more centered more centrist is just not true dont assume that if i dont agree with you on something that it must be because im doing that politically i may just disagree with you
269972 the government is stonewalling again by not allowing americans private dollars to be paid to american lawyers to defend civil liberties
269973 the chinese government is using the opportunity of hosting olympics to showcase the china that the chinese government wants the world to see and cover up the china that the chinese government does not want the outside to see so we came here to reveal this china to the other side of the world and more than that we have to send a message to the international community
269974 after fourteen months of study including seven meetings around the country and interviews with more than forty experts on this matter our commission has unanimously concluded that the central law governing this critical decision that is the war powers resolution of 1973 is ineffective and it should be repealed and it should be replaced however with a better law

269981 peru is a sovereign important country its a big country in the world and so we cant stand idly by as an outsider takes the liberty of provoking our country let alone from the president of bolivia himself this whole thing that there is a us base in peru is grounded in outrageous lies and manipulations
269982 i have personally experienced what it is like to live with a us military base north american soldiers who are armed wearing uniforms who instruct our armed forces who instruct the national police to participate in repressions to participate in massacres i have to share that experience with my latin american brothers it is an obligation of those who defend dignity

269986 with todays vote the government has been given a green light to expand its power to spy on americans and run roughshod over the constitution
269987 the fact is theyve just tested a missile that has a pretty extended range so my view in the first instance is weve been saying as weve talked about missile defense in europe that there is a real threat and it seems to me that the test this morning underscores that
269988 are we any closer to a military confrontation with iran
269989 but in terms of the missile test i see it as evidence that the missile threat is not an imaginary one and that those who say that there is no iranian missile threat against which we should be building missile defenses perhaps ought to talk to the iranians about their claims even about the distance and the range of the missiles that they test fired
269990 part of what we have to do is get the europeans the chinese the russians all to recognize that its in nobodys interests including irans i believe to have a nuclear weapon that could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region and thats something that i intend to make a number one priority when im in the white house making sure they dont have that nuclear capability
269991 its time for action and its time to make the iranians understand that this kind of violation of international treaties this kind of threatening of their neighbors this kind of continued military activity is not without cost
269992 see barack been talking down to black people on this faith based i wanna cut his beep off
269993 if anything ive said in a hot mic statement thats attributed as distraction i offer apology for that because i dont want harm or hurt to come to this campaign it represents too much of the dreams of so many who have paid such great prices and im very sensitive to what that means
269994 my appeal was for the moral content of his message to not only deal with the personal and moral responsibility of black males but to deal with the collective moral responsibility of government and the public policy
269995 i simply do not feel it is appropriate to honor a person whose epitaph of government service was to have voted against or blocked every civil rights issue that came before the us congress his doctrine of negativity hate and prejudice cost north carolina and our nation much that we may never regain
269996 on the agenda is the necessity of a general pay increase salaries and pensions to compensate not only the constantly increasing cost of living but also inflation
