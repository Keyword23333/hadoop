90000 thats not a good reason for the congress to rush ahead for the nuclear suppliers group to rush ahead or the iaea board of governors to rush ahead
90001 it is in the us interests and us law to cut off nuclear trade with a state that tests nuclear weapons
90002 but its also in the nsgs interests and heres why
90003 india freely admits that its nuclear weapons programme was borne of its civilian nuclear power programmes it has said this in the most recent document that it gave to the iaea
90004 india has insisted all along that any nuclear deal not impinge on its ability to conduct future nuclear tests even as it has promised to adhere to a unilateral test moratorium
90005 basically what we are dealing with here is the united states has really given india a blank cheque to proceed to go around all of the safeguards agreement of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and other agencies and is now it seems to me we are trying to assist them in cashing that check at another bank the nuclear suppliers group
90006 this is still another example and perhaps the most egregious example of this sort of foreign policy by unilateral fiat
90007 india has such facilities but it has not placed them under international safeguards
90008 throw out a whole system that youve built up painfully over 30 40 years just on a whim because you want to establish some sort of a so called strategic relationship with a country which has always been very good at protecting its own national interests and is not about to do anything in the international arena in the years to come thats going to make it an ally of the united states
90009 the indians have a very strong tradition of acting like the british they have no friends but they have permanent interests i wish sometimes the united states would act like that
90010 its possible the nsg may be convened by the end of august to discuss this but my conversations with many nsg governments suggest that the decision by the nsg is not going to be a quick or easy one i think it is highly unlikely that the united states is able to obtain for india a so called clean and unconditional exemption
90011 hur korkad f r man vara men det r klart att man undrat

90013 jessica is under a lot of pressure to stay in shape because there is so much competition among young actresses in hollywood
90014 jessica loves to work out and so does justin but lately it seems like thats all she does
90015 shes got an amazing body and justin is trying to get through to her that she can afford to take some time out once in a while and have a burger some beers and a day doing nothing
90016 youll have to wait and see whats next but it will be wild

90020 hezekiah trusted in the lord the god of israel there was never another king like him in the land of judah either before or after his time he remained faithful to the lord in everything and he carefully obeyed all the commands the lord had given moses so the lord was with him and hezekiah was successful in everything he did
90021 yes each of us will have to give a personal account to god so dont condemn each other anymore decide instead to live in such a way that you will not put an obstacle in another christians path
90022 the israelites have returned from a battle with the canaanites
90023 this quote is from and there is much more commentary on psalm 24 at bible
90024 ears to hear and eyes to see both are gifts from the lord
90025 within the church are people at all different levels of life both physically and spiritually young people to old people
90026 do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom christ died
90027 hear me levites now sanctify yourselves sanctify the house of the lord god of your fathers and carry out the rubbish from the holy place
90028 now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the lord god of israel that his fierce wrath may turn away from us
90029 we have cleansed all the house of the lord the altar of burnt offerings with all its articles and the table of the showbread with all its articles 19 moreover all the articles which king ahaz in his reign had cast aside in his transgression we have prepared and sanctified and there they are before the altar of the lord
90030 praise to the lord with the words of david and of asaph the seer
90031 might be lord of both the dead and the living
90032 let everyone who names the name of christ the lord depart from iniquity
90033 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues
90034 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
90035 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
90036 for a long time china has pursued a military policy that is defensive in nature it will never seek hegemonism chinas development will in no way affect or threaten the interests of others
90037 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public
90038 if you read the literature it says the vipers bites are pretty benign
90039 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad
90040 the majority are being caught in the shrimp trawls particularly in the gulf of mexico
90041 a lot of those sharks that are being landed are undersized
90042 thats putting a lot of pressure on those young sharks
90043 the indians are absolutely convinced its true and theyre right
90044 haqqani has been at the center of the insurgency for the past three years
90045 so much worse could happen but it makes you feel like youve been invaded someone is taking liberties on your property that you would never take with anyone else
90046 if youre just driving around you might not notice it
90047 if its too dangerous to touch it cant be clean
90048 the first show i worked on was a play dry rot by a local amateur company
90049 it was very nice coming to work here because as a youngster i had been a regular in the audience with my mother watching the plays performed by stanley ravenscrofts famous rep theatre company
90050 i must have seen tens of thousands of films over the years i enjoy the new ones but my favourites are still the old ones with gene kelly and cyd charrisse the great musicals
90051 i will miss watching all the films and shows but im planning on staying involved in theatre and cinema in some capacity
90052 the end of pier summer shows dont come here anymore and instead we get a lot of tribute acts
90053 in film today theres a lot more special effects and even in family films i think theres a bit too much bad language
90054 because we use old reels for the cinema and are not digital you have to train someone up
90055 we got a silent film in recently a buster keaton film and idris accompanied it on the piano playing in the dark for 20 minutes
90056 youve got to crawl before you can walk and walk before you can jog
90057 excuse me i saw you walking down the street and thought oh my god that woman is beautiful and had to come talk to you
90058 im thinking about doing all sorts of things to you that i probably shouldnt be thinking about
90059 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
90060 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
90061 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
90062 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public

90088 after a particularly difficult start to the quarter with the accident at the south deep gold mine in which nine of our colleagues tragically lost their lives the people of gold fields rallied together to show their mettle
90089 against this backdrop gold fields staged a welcome recovery with production increasing by 5 per cent from q3 which was negatively impacted by power interruptions while maintaining a tight control on costs despite the continued inflationary pressures world wide
90090 a comprehensive review of infrastructure across our operations following from the heightened safety awareness across the group since my appointment has resulted in urgent rehabilitation being necessary at the main shaft infrastructure at kloof and in particular replacement of a significant portion of the steelwork below 17 level
90091 notwithstanding the short term safety related actions to be initiated in south africa as referred to in the preceding paragraph long awaited growth projects will be commenced and brought to full production over the next two quarters in particular the completion of the new cave rocks and belleisle underground mines at st ives the addition of cerro corona and the completion of the tarkwa cil plant expansion during q2 position gold fields well to achieve its short term target of a production rate of approximately 4 million ounces of gold per annum at an nce of us 700 per ounce to us 725 per ounce at r us 8 00 early in calendar 2009
90092 introduction of three new strains for the influenza vaccine was unprecedented and could have resulted in a low yield or delay given our tight production timeline despite these challenges we are pleased that once again sanofi pasteur has demonstrated its reliability in supplying fluzone vaccine to the u s market
90093 the early shipment of fluzone vaccine by sanofi pasteur gives health care providers greater flexibility in planning their vaccination efforts
90094 as a manufacturer one of our primary objectives is to be responsive to the requests of our customers for early influenza vaccine shipments in planning their vaccination efforts it is important for health care providers and the public to realize that while influenza immunization programs often occur in the early fall the influenza season itself does not typically peak until february with disease appearing as late as may this allows many months for providers to administer influenza vaccine to their patients
90095 i feel bad fans have to be out there in the heat twice as long as i have to be
90096 we go out a little more throw in a little more covers
90097 it was hard to start but now im enjoying it
90098 its a cheatin song and a complex one at that
90099 was fun to see people argue about it thats what i want people talking about my music
90100 they owners should be aware that there are scams and frauds going on all of the time
90101 just dont be so trusting over the phone because you never know who you are talking to you never know who you are giving your private information to
90102 you get to a point where e mails and message boards and chat just are not enough
90103 you want face to face interactions you want to hear the giggling and not just see the lols
90104 we started with maybe five or 10 people my age but it just grew like really fast were at 10 000 adult members now it was quite a shocker
90105 each of us has a different reason for why its affected us but all of us have had to make the choice between good option a and good option b
90106 i was laying my baby down to put her down for a nap and i thought if bella becomes a vampire shes never going to experience this
90107 that fog kind of lifted i would choose this any minute to be a mom and to love my family and i couldnt give that up
90108 we have so much more in common than just the books
90109 theyre just secondary to the friendships and how much we support each other
90110 i dont neglect my kids i do the laundry im not on the computer all day
90111 men started signing in under their wives names to discuss the books and to discuss why their wives love these books so much
90112 my husband appreciates that i have a hobby but sometimes he jokes that he needs a support group for the husbands
90113 were already talking about what our next obsession will be
90114 but the things weve shared weve had so much fun together i dont have a doubt that well stay friends
90115 know the fence line was the safe place to be
90116 we also suspect that dunda might have had some type of link with the ahmedabad blasts
90117 i knew joe 55 plus years and i never heard him say a bad word about anybody
90118 those who do not follow christs principles are anti christ jon huntsman jr is anti christ people dont realize that because hes portrayed completely falsely in the media
90119 then theres the anti christ socialist huntsman who has raised taxes more than any governor in the history of utah
90120 and hes taken away more of your freedoms than any governor in the history of utah water
90121 will continue to work on the important issues for utahns
90122 its prayers from people that have kept us moving forward bridger would be dead if not for prayers
90123 he is a really cool kid just awesome and athletic a lot of kids wanted to be like him
90124 so when he gets out we want him to know about the attention he was getting so he can focus on something else other than the pain
90125 its hard to pray for bridger when you are wishing for millers death
90126 we cant do that our hearts are bleeding for craig
90127 we owe it to bridger to continue to keep praying
90128 she was always a nice friend and you just dont want to believe it
90129 this is a vital corridor in our transportation system both from an economic and mobility perspective
90130 the likelihood that his home will be condemned as uninhabitable and that he will be forced to abandon it as his neighbors have is very high
90131 we received the material and are grateful for their cooperation
90132 we also want to raise money from the private sector for scholarships and help connect our college to the community
90133 even little things like spanish punctuation help teachers understand latino culture and do better
90134 i also remember seeing scratches and bumps on my dad after a fight
90135 i can imagine there could be some element of truth there but to the extent fischer jeffs is claiming no way that is ludicrous
90136 when you get this many people looking at dan fischer who is probably considered their worst apostate you can expect all kinds of crap
90137 a heritage a lineage and the basic glue that holds a society together
90138 dan never helped me financially to take care of my children
90139 they were so down on me they could not even bring themselves to ask
90140 he is an embittered man trying to hide his own life
90141 he was relentless when it came to keeping you in the flds fold that said he was still my father
90142 it didnt matter if extra family or friends were around he often humiliated his children in public
90143 we could hear them beating and whipping her and they were still calling her bad names
90144 reconstruct what may or may not have occurred in these childrens minds is nauseating
90145 we did have spankings on the bottom we did believe in that as did most of the flds and as did many non flds 20 years ago
90146 i will tell you that i would not punish the same way today
90147 i am not a perfect person nor have i been in the past
90148 i hope i am a better person now but there is nothing of the magnitude they are claiming
90149 prejudices have been developing for probably 150 years that we need to break down and i believe were making progress
90150 to reach each other latinos we need to educate ourselves to learn english to learn about the culture were in and importance of obeying the law
90151 i tell young people the image is a negative one and if they want to dress like that they dont represent me
90152 were like pebbles in a pond and must ripple out from the center
90153 it looked and sounded like a bomb and did damage like a bomb
90154 i think what i did was to stay calm and controlled and do what i needed to do
90155 when i got there don had everything under control as far as the bleeding
90156 theres no question in my mind that if don would not have been there the boy would have been dead before the ambulance got there
90157 she said thank you we appreciate all your help last night
90158 before we had to ship our heavy beers in warm trucks and store them in an unrefrigerated warehouse for the best taste beers should be cold
90159 until then it never occurred to anyone to extend the rule to the distillery and breweries

90167 fema announces intention to adopt common alerting protocol 1 1
90168 arriving at standards and protocols that work for everyone is a complex process
90169 but fema intends to formally adopt and publish a profile in line with cap 1 1 early next year we are working closely with partners across the government private sector and non profit community to develop a cap profile that ensures the interoperability needed to deliver alerts and warnings to more people in more locations through more paths
90170 messaging standards improve information sharing and provide a foundation for data interoperability
90171 the divisions support of public alert and warning message standards is critical to our mission of creating and maintaining a secure and safe nation
90172 fema looks forward to continuing to work with its partners to make sure that ipaws supports and is interoperable with the various alert and warning systems developed by the state local tribal and territorial emergency managers to protect their residents
90173 the us national weather service nws provides weather hydrologic and climate forecasts and warnings for the united states its territories adjacent waters and ocean areas for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy nws data and products form a national information database and infrastructure which can be used by other governmental agencies the private sector the public and the global community
90174 the us federal communications commission fcc is an independent united states government agency
90175 this division develops interoperable communication standards and protocols for emergency responders cyber security tools for protecting the integrity of the internet and automated capabilities to recognize and analyze potential threats the directorate for science and technology is the primary research and development arm of dhs in partnership with the private sector national laboratories universities and other government agencies domestic and foreign this directorate helps push the innovation envelope and drive development and the use of high technology in support of homeland security
90176 the emergency interoperability consortium is made up of organizations that share the same goals for interoperable emergency communications the executive committee leads the consortium which participates in educational and outreach activities to the public and federal communities on incident and emergency management issues the consortiums primary objectives are to 1 create a national approach for data interoperability through an industry government consortium 2 promote the development of web services xml data interoperability standards necessary to support the timely and accurate exchange of incident information throughout the emergency management community 3 ensure every american has appropriate access to whatever information they require when and how they need it
90177 oasis is a not for profit consortium that drives the development convergence and adoption of open standards for the global information society the consortium produces web services standards along with standards for security e business and supports standardization efforts in the public sector and for application specific markets oasis maintains formal liaison relationships with w3c iso iso iec jtc1 itu unece rosettanet and many others
90178 the international association of emergency managers iaem which has members in 58 countries is a non profit educational organization dedicated to promoting the goals of saving lives and protecting property during emergencies and disasters
90179 workshop and demonstration of advances in ict standards for public warning
90180 requirements for data exchange among emergency management public safety homeland security and related applications and systems examples of data sharing applications within the technical committees scope include
90181 one of the most challenging aspects of emergency and incident management today has been the lack of consistent technical interoperability and standards historically the result has been siloed systems that are incapable of communicating with each other or of disseminating a single message in the forms eas broadcast internet cellular the use of data standards in emergencies increases the speed and accuracy of warnings reduces the cost and complexity of systems and allows seamless communication between sensors and alerting technologies emergency management organizations and the general public
90182 a key characteristic of the common alerting protocol cap is that it can be used to include and extend existing warning technologies as part of a larger integrated public alert and warning system history with society of broadcast engineers sbe comments of the society of broadcast engineers sbe before the federal communications commission society of broadcast engineers sbe strategy for impementing cap eas sbe offers plan to help fema move on cap
90183 frustrated by the lack of progress by fema the society of broadcast engineers offered to help move cap common alerting protocol from femas offices

90220 it is a very alarming fall in the amount of time cambridgeshire police officers spend on patrol since last year increasingly they are being tied down by bureaucratic paperwork
90221 labours red tape means officers are spending a pitiful amount of time on the beat
90222 there will be a new enhanced role for hmic to robustly and transparently scrutinise police performance and jan berry has been appointed as an independent bureaucracy champion to drive further cuts in red tape and free up extra police hours
90223 there were a number of reasons for the fall in frontline policing numbers
90224 finally the frontline policing measure has changed several times so some officer roles are no longer regarded as frontline
90225 whyd he do that that was pointless this games terrible
90226 he essentially admitted to his conduct which was outrageous and clearly life threatening and has changed the lives of these victims in many ways

90270 the educational landscape is changing rapidly and teachers and students want flexible and low cost resources our wileyflex program provides a variety of formats including print and digital options at a range of prices
90271 i could never advocate that students take something they know they should pay for but im also very much aware of the price of textbooks and the fact that publishers think of students as a captive audience they dont seem sensitive to student and families budgets

90465 im pretty free and unlimited as far as what i can do now
90466 it all depends on how they get out and compete on the football field but im not worried im very settled
90467 at running back that is a very demanding and punishing position to play and you dont often get through a season with just one guy

90476 one of them is my grandmother and i know what they are doing they are standing there to save the world
90477 you cant save the world by standing in the park that is what we have armies for
90478 everyone knows you have to have banners and slogans to save the world you cant do it by just standing in the park
90479 we are just individuals standing in our public park and we are not giving speeches or having a demonstration so why would we need a permit

90490 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues
90491 i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world
90492 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
90493 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
90494 by hosting the beijing games we will show the world that the chinese people are a peace loving nation
90495 for a long time china has pursued a military policy that is defensive in nature it will never seek hegemonism chinas development will in no way affect or threaten the interests of others
90496 most of the items in the exhibition have never been displayed in hong kong before
90497 chinese people believe the horse represents vigor and drive and a kind of hope in china from the most ancient cave paintings to imperial ceramics and sculpture there have been equine images and motifs
90498 now even though horses have less ties to everyday life the spirit of horses is still embodied in chinese art
90499 he xu wanted to convey the message that even though there were great difficulties china could still overcome them
90500 foreigners must respect chinese laws while in china and must not harm chinas national security or damage social order
90501 foreign students like to stay out all night on the weekend but in more intellectual and traditional chinese households there is no way the kids would go out like that
90502 it was forecast earlier this year that the numbers would improve during the second half of the year but theres no sign of relief right now
90503 the numbers are weakening even more than what we would have expected
90504 the olympics could have an impact because a lot of factories were ordered to shut down to improve air quality for the athletes competing in china but expect a bounce up in october as shippers rush to recover from that and prepare for the holiday season
90505 ships aircraft and industrial equipment burn huge quantities of fossil fuel causing serious greenhouse gas polluton
90506 if bush was serious about americas dangerous and growing foreign oil dependency he would forthwith direct epa to do its job and regulate greenhouse gases
90507 ships aircraft and industrial equipment burn huge quantities of fossil fuel causing serious greenhouse gas pollution yet president bush stalls with one bureaucratic dodge after another
90508 the lawsuit is certainly typical of the attorney general of california
90509 if they dont like how we make a decision on something they sue and hope the courts will mandate toward their position it works sometimes and sometimes it doesnt work
90510 the bush administration is wasting precious time with continued foot dragging time that we dont have
90511 when youve always had to live this way it becomes pretty normal
90512 it really requires a tremendous amount of discipline and self denial
90513 my mom felt so bad for me so she broke a little piece off
90514 there are all kinds of things that can happen up there but the first thing that comes to mind is the treacherous road
90515 the way those marks are it shows she was coming around the curve she left the lane of travel and went into the shoulder and over the edge
90516 the investigation will be very detailed so investigators are talking to her family friends and anybody that saw her the day before
90517 its a horrible thing for an absolutely gorgeous woman and wife but if theres any blessing in this story its that her two beautiful kids were not in the car with her

90520 this is the second straight quarter production came in below expectations investors are going to be questioning when they can turn that around
90521 you really hope to see them not turn so much of a profit
90522 im all for making a profit its the american way but its another thing to gouge
90523 given todays strong market incentive for expanding exploration and production we can only believe that reinvesting your vast profits into the production of more oil and natural gas in the united states is a profitable strategy that will help our country decrease its dependence on foreign oil
90524 the oil and natural gas industry is massive because it has to be to effectively compete for global energy resources
90525 the industrys earnings make possible the huge investments necessary to help ensure americas future energy needs are met

90534 atmosf ra v hlavnom stane obamovej kampane je ve mi optimistick udia s tu ve mi pevne rozhodnut
90535 naopak john mccain m obrovsk probl m dosta sa do m di barack obama je jednoducho medi lne ove a zauj mavej

90546 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
90547 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
90548 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
90549 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
90550 we agree with david that the whole party should pull together take the fight to the tories and focus on dealing with the real issues affecting peoples lives

90597 past research in fibromyalgia syndrome had found a number of symptoms that are prevalent including pain reduced ability to perform everyday tasks sleep problems and depression
90598 it has not been clear up to now whether one of these symptoms caused the others because they are all identified at the same time and they are all related
90599 there are many practitioners who believe that it may be depression that causes fibromyalgia symptoms which impacts how patients are treated in clinics our study shows that in fact depression is at the end of a cascade of symptoms that begin with sleep problems
90600 our findings indicate that this population may benefit greatly from treatments both medical and behavioral geared toward improving sleep
90601 better sleep medications have been developed recently that may help this group particularly
90602 behavioral clinicians can teach these patients good sleep hygiene techniques that may work with the medication to improve sleep
90603 based on our findings improving sleep will improve pain functioning and depression

90691 we all felt that information overload was something that was such a big problem that some companies were beginning to be aware of it but a lot of people didnt realize the magnitude of the problem
90692 i havent made up my mind whether to go through with it
90693 its going to cost us thousands of dollars just to keep our dogs with our family
90694 as happens so often these folks went down to city hall thinking they would get to present their side of the story like on judge judy or the peoples court

90727 karenanya keputusan ue sebaiknya diabaikan saja karena sejak awal tidak jelas hal apa saja yang menjadi indikator agar indonesia bisa lepas dari larangan terbang tersebut
90728 buktinya persyaratan dan prosedurnya dalam rangka menentukan kelaikan terbang suatu penerbangan tidak pernah diungkapkan
90729 bila pun disebabkan karena revisi undang undang penerbangan yang belum selesai itu bukanlah substansi utama indonesia tetap terkungkung dalam larangan terbang yang tidak jelas ini karena proses revisinya bisa sambil jalan

90748 i do know that back in 2000 the film was over with kirschner productions i talked with a couple of the concept artists that worked on that particular proposal but its been so long that they didnt have a lot to say one remembered reading the script and had a few anecdotes about his own involvment whereas the other remembered vaguely working on moorwen concepts ive been curious about that particular effort to mount the production since and whether or not any of this art survives were they not happy with patrick tatopolous creature design or were they just getting alternate takes on the concept

90760 we believe obviously that media is fragmenting but if you can build your portfolio by launch and acquisition and the right combination of products to meet the needs of readers and advertisers theres no reason you cant grow very healthily in the future

90762 i could buy market share tomorrow pick a number and i could buy it but it would mean cutting the price like our competitors to inflate sales volume and spending cash on dvds and cds just to make a headline sales increase from which shareholders will not get a return
90763 we look back on the multiples we sold the businesses on and they look like damn good multiples now dont they
90764 we have no plans to do that and no issues with our balance sheet

90779 steven did a very good job of bringing out the many components of what makes patti unique and she is a unique artist
90780 shes a youthful attractive soft spoken girl i didnt take pictures until the end of the day but when i saw her perform at irving plaza in new york city this wasnt the same woman to me i was totally hooked
90781 i was just that friend who was behind the camera
90782 thats why the film is so personal because i wasnt going into it with a crew i was just trying to do something really cool and documenting somebody that inspired me

90784 hes captured a certain informality that is often lacking in these more standard rock docs
90785 shes funny and can tell story thats what makes people sort of shocked
90786 if we were a rock band we probably wouldve gotten back together and broken up a million times
90787 we find the musical verses of wilsons song to be such an obvious example of copyright infringement that i expect all parties to reach a relatively quick resolution to avoid litigation

90826 wasas compliance with federal water safety standards at this point depends on cleaning peoples lead service lines and pipes the night before they sample for lead
90827 if youre gone for the weekend then the lead levels would typically be higher
90828 we want to get samples that represent the same premise that water has sat in the pipe for at least six to eight hours
90829 if you wanted to find a lead problem this is not what you would do
90830 if you wanted to hide a lead problem this is what you would do
90831 it removes all traces of lead that would come from the lead service line
90832 neither the lead and copper rule or the guidance really addresses flushing prior to stagnation

90857 false teachers cover and color their dangerous principles and soul impostures with very fair speeches and plausible pretences with high notions and golden expressions
90858 bewitched and deceived by the magnificent words lofty strains and stately terms of deceivers
90859 false teachers strive more to win over men to their opinions than to better them in their conversations
90860 but false prophets also arose among the people just as there will also be false teachers among you who will secretly introduce destructive heresies even denying the master who bought them bringing swift destruction upon themselves many will follow their sensuality and because of them the way of the truth will be maligned and in their greed they will exploit you with false words their judgment from long ago is not idle and their destruction is not asleep
90861 for from the least of them even to the greatest of them everyone is greedy for gain and from the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely
90862 they have healed the brokenness of my people superficially saying peace peace but there is no peace

90872 in new orleans all the coaches were responsible for recruiting individual players
90873 ron thought i would be a good guy to work with
90874 theres a slight possibility in the future if the higher ranked nationwide series wanted to add a road race to the three they already do or switch out one they already have

90877 hopefully its here i really want it to happen i really like the team i like the guys that they have here i think that we have the pieces to be able to win hopefully ill just be one of those final pieces to bring it all together
90878 this has always been one of the tougher teams to play against in my career
90879 and so now to be on the other side of that and cause havoc for everyone else is definitely a positive for me
90880 i know that this is deron williams team theres no question about that hes worked to get himself in that position and hes a great player in this league hopefully i can come here and continue to push him continue to make him a better player
90881 ronnie i think has been a great point guard here also i can come in and help him also were going to compete and push each other to try to be the best that we can all be but itll be within the team atmosphere
90882 im pretty free and unlimited as far as what i can do now
90883 it all depends on how they get out and compete on the football field but im not worried im very settled
90884 at running back that is a very demanding and punishing position to play and you dont often get through a season with just one guy
90885 im looking forward to that that is what im all about it makes me better and it makes my teammates better
90886 not only will the air children breathe on the bus be cleaner it will be cleaner for the rest of us as well

90900 i just dont see a lot of hope from either obama or mccain
90901 mr harrison believed that mr mays was reaching for a gun to shoot him
90902 under the circumstances of mr mays verbal threats aggressive approach toward mr harrison and action of lifting his shirt and reaching his hand toward his waistband mr harrisons belief was reasonable
90903 we believe this incident falls within the parameters of self defense and that the shooting was justified
90904 the whole thing seems to have been pretty quick i dont think mr harrison had time to deliberate about anything
90905 its fair to say he wishes the whole thing hadnt happened

90916 marty is a great umpire he does a super job he explained to me what he was calling i just got thrown out for arguing balls and strikes which is the rule you cant do it
90917 i lost my head and i felt really bad for kicking my hat and raising all that ruckus out there
90918 i dont like that probably a little bit too much emotions and i got a little nuts out there i feel bad that it stopped the ballgame like that
90919 i wasnt worried about hats but i saw a couple balls flying on to the field and thought it was a dangerous situation
90920 i knew gardy was going to throw his hat eventually
90921 its his go to move he usually doesnt kick it though that was pretty entertaining

90924 military force has rarely been the primary reason for the end of terrorist groups and few groups within this time frame have achieved victory
90925 use of substantial u s military power against terror groups also runs a significant risk of turning the local population against the government by killing civilians
90926 well fall back into the pre 9 11 mind set if you will that in fact these terrorist attacks are just criminal acts and that were not really at war
90927 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism

90933 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
90934 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose

90936 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose

90939 this is one of the most unimaginable things to actually happen to a child

90951 this is much too long to leave americans hostage to the gas pumps
90952 exploting our suffering at the gas pump as an excuse to represent big oil
90953 every informed person knows there isnt enough oil in anwar to dramatically impact the price of gas
90954 the study also predicts a 2 to 6 percent decline in market share for all imported liquid petroleum products
90955 this means the price per barrel of oil would fall between only 41 cents and 1

91068 like my last two films this one is also set in mumbai and ramesh sippy is producing it as for the budget i dont know

91070 so i pushed the project back now i have to wait for them to be free i dont know when i will start shooting the film

91114 yes the film finally has a title now it would now be known as johnny mastana the films first set of teaser posters are already out and they have johnny mastana imprinted on them in any case shoebite was never a confirmed title so it cant be said that the film has gone though a title change

91133 it is nearly unprece dented to see so many providers raise their purchase rates over such a short period generally hiking the purchase rate is considered a last resort for lenders as they have to put this headline rate in their adverts if they need extra cash they will normally do other things like increase the fees for transferring a debt from another card or for using the card at an atm to withdraw cash
91134 if banks continue to be unable to raise cash on the international money markets i can only see some headline rates getting higher
91135 these headline rates are only the typical annual percentage rate on offer if someone doesnt have a perfect credit record it may be that they are already being offered a rate in excess of the headline banks have definitely been tightening their lending criteria

91152 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
91153 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
91154 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
91155 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed

91170 its fascinating to watch barack obama change his opinions on the u s troop surge in iraq heres a combo a los angeles times report on deletions of obamas previous anti surge position on his web site plus a youtube video showing his flip flops on the issue
91171 like everything barack obama says that pledge was operative only as long as it was in obamas political interest

91175 barack obama told the milwaukee journal sentinel in february that he was open to voucher programs but just last week announced his intentions to squash the dc pilot program

91178 in january 2004 obama said he supported eliminating criminal penalties for marijuana use in the oct 30 2007 presidential debate he joined other democratic candidates in opposing the decriminalization of marijuana
91179 at a time when the surge appears to be working is that the right time to try and set time tables for withdrawing all american troops
91180 and you pull out according to that time table regardless of the situation even if theres serious sectarian violence
91181 ten years ago when obama was running for statewide office in an exclusive chicago district he opposed the death penalty he now supports the ultimate penalty
91182 during the recent obama pander tour the presumptive democratic nominee unnecessarily endorsed president bushs faith based initiative a sort of patronage program that rewards religious activists for their political support with public grants

91186 contradicting what obama said at the debate the old footage shows the senator saying
91187 i never said that we should try to go ahead and get single payer single payer healthcare is an euphemism for socialized medicine

91235 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
91236 we are well prepared since year end we have adapted our plans to reflect the fast moving and challenging conditions we have reduced capacity in the winter schedule without compromising our network and at the same time we have the flexibility in the business to capitalise when conditions improve
91237 we have revised our capital expenditure plans and are focusing on cost control we have ordered six new boeing 777 300er aircraft for delivery beginning in 2010 they are 23 more fuel efficient than the boeing 747 400 and give us additional flexibility in the long haul fleet

91246 the levy will commence on august 18 and be used for educating the public on the dangers of alcohol abuse rehabilitation programmes for victims of alcohol abuse and other good causes
91247 it is further disheartening that government has unilaterally targeted a single industry with this huge development without providing any notice let alone consultation with the industry
91248 imposing a 70 levy is a sledge hammer approach that fails to take into account the complexity of consumption and trade in alcohol
91249 when they started laughing he went ballistic and started hitting the roof of the car
91250 my son grabbed him and threw him against the wall

91254 they carry with them the bitter knowledge of the injustice of the past we dont blame them for the sins of their forefathers
91255 that is why we appointed an agency to help us with hostel integration these findings will also be made available to them
91256 when you lose a couple it puts an extra emphasis on this particular test and i think thats pretty obvious
91257 oh for sure its a big game for the bledisloe cup and the tri nations
91258 they are excited they are standing at the foot of the hill and they are ready to climb
91259 as to whether they are going to be good enough we cant do anymore than we are doing
91260 hes a world class player but we cant expect him to do everything
91261 we have to step up as a team and if we do that well be a more competitive side we have to play a lot smarter
91262 we have to be smart about the way we play but also bring the physical side of things and the aggression if we are to get what we are after
91263 im currently packing up real quick to hop on a plane to new york for a second opinion but i wanted to let you all know first that there is no chance of me competing in beijing
91264 with no exercise you can take a drug and chemically mimic it

91267 he has good feet and weve got to continue to work with joe to be there and able to play the entire game and carry us in the third and fourth quarters and not so much early in the game when hes fresh conditioning will be a big factor for him
91268 i think we were a little apprehensive from the year before in arkansas
91269 we went 2 1 and lost to a good texas east team and team from new mexico so we knew that would have two good teams back again
91270 i think it just gave me an idea of how good i needed to be and what i needed to do for us to win the next year
91271 after we lost coach ed thorne came over and said well now you know you can be beat it really put us on the edge for the next season
91272 i think it definitely gave us an idea of what we were going to see
91273 we knew lamar was a good team from 2006 they wound up losing to tomball in the texas east tournament
91274 weve tried to have this attitude since everything started that helps us not get too ahead of anything
91275 one pitch one out one inning one game at a time
91276 being a part of this team has been a win in itself
91277 the best part has been working with these kids and watching them develop after every game and practice and not only do they not know how to get up but its just been great to watch them believe a loss cant take that away
91278 its improved wait times but it also alleviates stress at checkpoints
91279 families arent pressured by business travelers and business travelers arent held up
91280 the numbers have shown it increases the flow of passengers

91285 im definitely thinking that far in advance first you become a spokesperson and then you can branch out as you become a personality and as people know your name you can do more things
91286 i entered the modeling business as an entrepreneur and businesswoman
91287 that man taught me a lot about business i didnt quit and that was the foundation of how i learned to under promise and over deliver
91288 i had closed the door on modeling but then this small business asked me to model their socks i didnt want to do that but i thought it could be a good place to start my business
91289 i always knew i belonged on the other side of the camera
91290 i didnt want to tempt fate and not be prepared for the end and then find out i didnt save enough money or not be ready to do anything else i had to figure out my next move
91291 some models become photographers makeup artists and stylists its like an actor becoming a director
91292 were not just hangers up there we dont just sit and smile even though its a common misperception
91293 i had to divorce myself of my modeling career to be taken seriously
91294 i wanted to sell something that i believed in i didnt want to be pimped out in the way that i had been as a model it felt good to work and tell people about something i believed in
91295 it was a huge leap of faith for them to take me
91296 i didnt really like being a model i didnt live that life id rather stay home and read i was the anti model model
91297 im really excited this is the first opportunity ive had to be a designer
91298 im trying to find my own little niche i dont want to do anything just to do it i want something close to my heart and have it come naturally
91299 growing up in california swimsuits are something im around a lot its my work and its what i do in my personal life too
91300 first we have to determine what caused the babys death
91301 i will never forget the time my dads dance facility opened
91302 it was 1971 and things were exciting because my dad had just opened a ballroom here in lubbock
91303 we are still going strong but there is something we need to do to boost the tejano genre as well as our business
91304 the industry and ballroom owners have definitely taken a hit
91305 there has been tension between the two bands and oscar from la mafia finally wanted to put a stop to it and challenged a b and the kumbia all starz to a battle here in lubbock
91306 i think this showdown will bring old tejano listeners to start listening again
91307 i feel that this feud will unite the mexican culture together and thus help the industry and ballroom owners to rejuvenate the tejano business
91308 ive been hearing from my friends in dallas about the battle and they dont even listen to tejano music
91309 its the best of the old and the best of the new
91310 it certainly cannot hurt the people of west texas we all know that controversy would be good for the tejano fans of lubbock i wish they would battle here in lubbock we have a huge fan base and its a neutral spot
91311 were expecting to receive an offer to purchase the hospital
91312 do you want to drive the train or ride on it
91313 dont get sucked into the notion that you own the water in place under your land
91314 the water isnt down there like it used to be so weve got a serious situation
91315 i think the last thing we want is for the government to come in and control our water
91316 clapp park is not an option on the table anymore
91317 were mad why hasnt this been brought to our attention we had to read about the location change in the paper it was disrespectful
91318 it really doesnt do to bypass the board we elect people to represent us at city hall and sometimes it seems like city hall is dictating to us
91319 i want to move on but i think we should clear up what has happened were going to hold you accountable
91320 im the mayor and i take responsibility and i apologize
91321 this is a renewed commitment we do want you involved to make recommendations to us and thats why were here today
91322 its been my philosophy all along that we need something that was more central in the city so that we have equal access
91323 we kill enough animals to fill jones at amp t stadium three feet high every year
91324 as far as i know our center is the only place in the u s conducting production research on yerba mansa
91325 we targeted native herbs in an effort to find alternative crops for small farmers that are drought tolerant and have a built in pest resistance and yerba mansa is an ideal plant that meets that criteria
91326 i say get over it all cities grow and we all have to deal with it i would rather lubbock stay ahead of the curve so it can stay ahead of the development those who live outside the city and commute in probably pay more in gas over the course of a year than they would in property taxes
91327 shes 96 years old and can still whip you at dominos
91328 im not sad that i missed the trials im sad that i wasnt having enough fun to go to the trials
91329 mary had the capacity to train very hard and i always thought she could be the best
91330 when she started to shy away from that i believe she lost her main ingredient to be successful shes got a lot of natural ability but thats only no 2 or no 3 in what would make her the best in the world
91331 i thought her dad gene was realistic and understanding but i felt martha was making judgments on things she knew nothing about
91332 if after three years you dont feel the situation is productive anymore what choice is there to make
91333 i think mary wanted to be the bigger fish in a small pond i thought she could be a big fish in a big pond
91334 this program should be abolished its turned out to be a colossal waste of taxpayer money
91335 but the lieutenant governor believes its prudent to receive the results of this next round of tests before making any final determination about the need for continued funding

91339 i think we should have gone farther because i dont want a kid to wreck his life
91340 it seems like an awful lot of money for a very little problem
91341 but i guess if it keeps one kid from doing steroids it cant be a bad thing
91342 there are those who would say its done its job
91343 most school superintendents and athletic directors are asking why were wasting money coaches think its served its purpose
91344 i really believe we have a lot more problems with cocaine marijuana and the abuse of alcohol than we do steroids
91345 hey mom dad can you set an extra place at the dinner table im bringing home a friend for supper
91346 its because you and your brother dont do anything around here for you its all fun and games when have you ever seen me not working

91348 kids dont bale hay anymore they dont spend the summer throwing 80 pound bales of hay 15 rows up they grill hamburgers
91349 when i played 25 30 years ago we didnt have it and at two a days we were dragging
91350 it does get challenging but you just gotta think lets get that third ring
91351 it felt so good to win a state championship you do all this and its worth it
91352 for us it really has no bearing other than working a little bit on defense
91353 they try to work on stuff that the girls can do and the boys can too
91354 i think being in a small school definitely benefitted me because i could play everything and i didnt have to stick to one sport
91355 when you think you have something and you lose it at the last second it really got my motivation going for track
91356 i was hoping but i didnt really expect it to happen
91357 we dont get to throw the ball much in real football so its pretty good to come out here and throw the football around a little bit
91358 weve always tried to do what were good at and right now were good at running and catching
91359 were going to run the football thats our main deal
91360 for cross country my season was pretty good i didnt end it the way i wanted to but on the whole it was good
91361 in track i was really happy i won all the big races i wanted to win

91375 i pushed this important legislation through the legislature because i knew it would deter our young people from wrecking their bodies and putting their lives at risk by using illegal steroids
91376 this is one of those issues that sounds good but has no real impact except wasting taxpayer dollars
91377 i dont want to diminish the seriousness of steroids but you cant take a sledgehammer to kill a gnat
91378 i think kids know that its dangerous and it aint worth whatever gains you might get from it for a year or two
91379 if we come back and you have just another two positive tests then i think it would be realistic to scaling it back some
91380 i dont think anyone would have a problem with that because you still have the deterrent factor out there because its a random test

91396 im currently packing up real quick to hop on a plane to new york for a second opinion but i wanted to let you all know first that there is no chance of me competing in beijing
91397 the timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything
91398 after wednesdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
91399 after taking a few different exams and mris the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
91400 there are so many mixed feelings because on wednesday night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious
91401 but after thursday mornings tests for the first time in a while they were able to give me a different answer and a different problem

91405 second round effects have set in as evident in the surge in core inflation and a rise in inflation expectations has been perceptible from surveys
91406 the latest assessment is that inflation could settle above the 2008 and 2009 targets
91407 the global non oil commodity price hikes appear prolonged and are expected to take longer to unwind
91408 the negative outlook reflects both the potential impact of weaker credit conditions in nabs core geographies as well as ongoing dislocations in credit markets moodys financial institutions group senior vice president patrick winsbury said
91409 the ratings outlook is reflecting trends that may affect a rating over the next 12 months
91410 the nab outlook is reflecting the increasingly challenging conditions that weve seen in international markets including in wholesale funding markets mr winsbury said
91411 australian banks on average have one of the very highest ratings around the world mr winsbury said
91412 there are very few banks globally that would be aaa that would not be government related
91413 as we indicated national australia bank is coming up toward the weak end of its ratings range in a number of categories he said
91414 were obviously expecting that other banks will make provisions as they come up to their reporting season given that there have been a number of impaired accounts that have been highlighted and delinquencies in the consumer sector seem to be picking up slowly

91419 audited financial statements are material information which can have a major impact on price and volume traded in the absence of such important disclosures the ability of investors to make investment decisions is compromised
91420 further the exchange is of the view that the suspensions warranted given indications by the company that no auditor has yet been appointed all licensed members of the exchange will not be able to execute ygl orders until the suspension is uplifted
91421 accordingly the shareholder approval resolution no 6 at the agm held on the 18th december 2007 given for the issue of shares to rpi lapsed as at 30th june 2008
91422 and whilst they are continuing in their attempts to secure the necessary funding for the investment in the company they can give no assurance of timing or their capacity to do so under the terms of the current agreements
91423 consequently whilst the company has fulfilled the requirements of the international financial reporting standards ifrs it will be unable to fulfil the statutory requirement for the submission of audited accounts to the spse prior to july 31st 2008
91424 the validity of the company continuing as a listed entity is called into question given our current position and financial requirements
91425 due to the prevailing domestic and international economic circumstances including in international credit crisis and associated tight finance market conditions the company has been unable to fulfil its business plans within the intended timeframes as anticipated and presented to market and remains effectively in a non trading predevelopment stage which now does not align with being a listed entity
91426 consequently the company is facing financing and structuring pressures for which a non listed status is deemed to be more appropriate and which would potentially provide greater flexibility for the company to achieve its business objectives

91438 why not its a lot of fun its a lot of headaches too
91439 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
91440 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
91441 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
91442 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
91443 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
91444 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come

91447 most people believe that if a bridge is structurally deficient somethings wrong with it right now

91449 my hope is we can release this proposal on friday and our colleagues will go home during the august recess and listen to their constituents
91450 we hope to turn down the thermostat and cool the politically overheated talk about energy policy in the senate and the house
91451 it is unfortunate that the president has made our job harder by repeatedly turning up the thermostat
91452 unfortunately some people see political advantage in making certain the senate doesnt do anything
91453 i think there is a very good likelihood that when people listen to their constituents back home they will discover people will not accept delay until after the election
91454 i wish i could turn back and change that whole day
91455 we cant sit still when we see the opportunity to support our mission
91456 we get in fear not mode and go for it
91457 we have seen significant improvements in the clinical situation for nine out of 10 elders living there
91458 after two years of operation hospitalizations among the green house elders remain 30 percent less than the national average
91459 the reason this is significant is because hospitalization takes its toll too often it begins a downward spiral medically
91460 in nebraska its estimated living in the green house is 5 to 10 percent more than traditional setting
91461 when we built private rooms in 1992 it was unheard of at that time
91462 weve prayed and dreamed about a house that would provide end of life care
91463 we want to provide a continuum of service consistent with our mission to provide compassionate care with attention to dignity independence and health of elders
91464 since mothers been at the green house she refers to it as home shell say when are you coming home to visit
91465 we scrapped all day and we needed wickets to get back into this match im reaping all the hard work ive done with lancashire physiotherapist dave roberts after my ankle operation

91470 you get good battles in test cricket and its good for the game
91471 people say test cricket is dying but its clear that is not the case what more do you want than periods of play like that
91472 it probably doesnt mean that much at this stage but maybe when im older i can sit down and look at it more so

91489 ways of seeing is the book of a groundbreaking and brilliant tv series that berger created with mike dibb in the 1970s the book isnt quite as amazing as the series but its acquired canonical status anyway as bergers most frequently set text on art and art criticism which is a pity because while the impressive confidence of bergers judgments was inspiring back then marina warner and michael ondaatje have each paid tribute to it time has passed over the last quarter of a century and the book is in danger of looking old fashioned the theory of desire which berger manages to popularise in a single succinct chapter has been challenged confirmed turned upside down and generally elaborated upon so much since the book was written that his version of it is now inadequate advertising is vastly more sophisticated now than it was in 1972 the ads reproduced in the book while perfectly representative of their time are almost laughable in their blatant sexism and classism you wouldnt get away with them now thats for sure but the account of the rise of oil painting is still persuasive even if it lacks the cheek and mischievousness of the tv version readers expecting to find bergers most incisive and complex criticism should look elsewhere though to the sense of sight or about looking because ways of seeing is essentially a popularisation of theories that have since become much more complex and bergers lapidary no argument tone is hardly applicable anymore somebody should release the series on video then wed get the same ideas in a more engaging and fascinating manner
91490 the levy will commence on august 18 and be used for educating the public on the dangers of alcohol abuse rehabilitation programmes for victims of alcohol abuse and other good causes
91491 it is further disheartening that government has unilaterally targeted a single industry with this huge development without providing any notice let alone consultation with the industry
91492 imposing a 70 percent levy is a sledge hammer approach that fails to take into account the complexity of consumption and trade in alcohol
91493 what should i have done to make him be a little loose and relaxed when it comes to such things
91494 what what whats that whats caucasian whats the caucasian race whats that
91495 caucasian is a race its one of the three main races the caucasian race the white race
91496 white race what whats the white race whats that do you believe in that stuff
91497 well i think white people have a right to be proud i think white people should be proud everyone else is
91498 well in the future if you could avoid discussing that you know discussing peoples races
91499 i wonder if they are ripping me off because im white
91500 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
91501 i am yet to watch a single wwe show where punk is treated like a top guy
91502 raw was not just bad it was a i cant believe this made it on air type of bad
91503 todd grisham did fine as play by play and tazz seemed to enjoy working with him
91504 theres no concrete offer for diego and i dont think theres going to be one in the next few days
91505 they are asking for an impossible price for a player of his age
91506 we are still hopeful an important offer will be made anyway its improbable to see him moving during the transfer window
91507 ben haim is a good experienced premier league defender who maybe has a point to prove he feels he did not get enough games at chelsea and is looking to be involved a lot more here
91508 he will not be the only new arrival we are looking for good players in several positions and are working on a few deals
91509 they defended extremely well it was damage limitation from them really but you have to give them praise for their efforts
91510 their goalkeeper had a wonderful night they threw bodies in the way of everything and made life very difficult for us
91511 i was pleased with my lads they kept at them and if their goalkeeper had not had such a great night we would have won it at a canter
91512 but frankly we were never in any danger we should have won by a fair margin and we should have been quicker in possession but the key is that we have qualified for the next round that was the objective
91513 i could never have imagined achieving anything like this when i first came to manchester united
91514 i worked for the best manager of all time sir alex ferguson i played with the best players in the world and in front of the best supporters
91515 i am very proud of what i achieved but very humble as well that i was given the opportunity to do that
91516 maybe these kids have some respect for us because they know us from united
91517 they play with the manchester united shirt on too and hopefully use us as role models
91518 i remember sticking my foot out and the ball going in but everything else is a bit of a blur
91519 it was pure instinct i had never even done it in practice i was not familiar with the feeling when my foot hit the ball so i didnt know it was going in thankfully it did
91520 funnily enough we had done something very similar to liverpool in the fa cup earlier that season and i got the winner then so while we were surprised to beat bayern it wasnt a shock that we achieved it in the way we did
91521 three years before i came on as a substitute in the fa cup final against millwall honestly thinking it would be my last game for united
91522 i knew i needed another operation and i just felt that would be it
91523 so to win the premier league again one that my eldest son noah was old enough to remember gave me something i will always treasure
91524 i am not surprised at the number of ex alex ferguson players who have gone on to be managers
91525 something about the gaffer rubs off on you he knows his players he signs players he sees a little bit of himself in they have the right personality
91526 but you take little bits but he has seen and done everything and i have tried to learn from the way he never panics
91527 he just takes his time and makes a decision and sticks by it
91528 you want the best players playing and there is no doubt that carlos is one of those
91529 but i think you have to give kirk broadfoot credit he came in and did really well staked his claim and thats the way it should be
91530 if people do miss out then it gives an opportunity to others and kirk took it
91531 barry is our captain and probably our best player so we are going to miss him
91532 we would rather have him here but thats the nature of the game
91533 sometimes players dont make it you just have to adjust and it gives other people an opportunity to step up
91534 kaunas are well into their season and ahead of us regarding fitness but i thought we were the stronger team
91535 it was our first competitive game and they have had maybe 15 so that is obviously an advantage but there is no point looking for excuses
91536 the 0 0 scoreline was not the ideal scoreline for us but we are still very much in it and its all to play for
91537 its half time in the game and im sure both teams will think they are capable of winning it
91538 hopefully we will win the game over there but im sure it will be very tight
91539 the competition for places is great and we need that in the premier league
91540 when it comes to possibly selling players you can never say never although us managers are greedy and you never really like to let anyone go
91541 sometimes you accept an offer which is good for the club and the player but i hope not to be doing that too often
91542 ever try to remember who you bumped into at the store a few days back well youre not alone and ibm researchers are working on software that just may help you
91543 hey so youre a biology nut and read neal stephanson in your spare time hey whats your name

91547 to make more money and so you are using your brain to accomplish things

91550 i dont care gt gt what they want i cant afford to build the route to bring it to gt gt them
91551 the primary reason is simple it would require us to bring in a 3rd party service the 3rd party service is definitely not an option we would prefer as that would cost more for the service then it would to ship the game the dvd case packaging and the dvd media printing combined
91552 hey i know its early but you have an awesome day ahead of you
91553 so put on your favorite outfit eat a healthy breakfast and get a move on
91554 i love the art of hip hop i dont always love the message of hip hop
91555 there are times where even with the artists i love you know theres a message that is not only sometimes degrading to women not only uses the n word a little too frequently but also something im really concerned about its always talking about material things
91556 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
91557 its much more of a girls book it appeals to a female readership in the same way jane austen does
91558 im not putting it in the same class of literature but it has a lot of similarities
91559 i had such a strong response to it that i knew other people who wouldnt identify themselves as vampire or romance fans would feel the same way i did
91560 do we really want our daughters reading books about a girl like bella who is always needing to be saved who is willing to give up her mortality for a boy

91567 andy is a gentleman and very caring it touches me till i fall in love with him and wanted to be married to him

91570 thus i will enjoy the time together with andy during shooting
91571 is it dont worry we have lots of time ask her not to worry
91572 it doesnt matter because i have a role model in peter lam i can find the feeling from him
91573 when i see her at the set everyday if shes unhappy i dont dare to talk to her when see her pressurize i will go to her and ask her about everything luckily she didnt bother me
91574 andy gave me many guidance and opinions he had his own opinion of the film he gave me many tips
91575 ive no problems with him weve just discussing how to act we discussed about everything were happy throughout shooting if you dont believe me you can go and ask ka wah we had tally what we should said he will know how to answer this question
91576 what feeling actually carina and me were a couple now they got married then i have feelings this is impossible
91577 im just saying that ill reveal when its the time to tell everybody i will also receive everybodys blessing its not now
91578 even if he invite me i also dont dare to go because ill be chased around by others i dont feel that hes petty for not inviting me im also not petty for not giving him any present im really happy for him why reporters like to make us looked so distance
91579 no matter what i still agree with him i feel that the media should forgive him its a known fact that his daughter has a little deformation on her face why make a fuss out of it
91580 hitting someone is wrong but on the angle of li ya peng there is no way to stop such actions its really difficult
91581 ill also lost control of myself and have the same actions as him although i wish i would not do this i think i would do the same if being pushed to the limit
91582 i loved diamonds but just the small ones it can be bought easily i loved to look at diamonds thus i will spend some money to buy small diamonds and keep this should be considered as an expensive hobby other than this im no different to other people its the same as investing in films without consideration sometimes the money cannot be earned back
91583 i would give her a few 2 carats diamond this is not an issue of big or small carats i can give her one annually
91584 tomorrow tomorrow i love ya tomorrow its only a day away

91586 the forceful measures that we took well in advance to enhance cost effectiveness have been successful
91587 although product launches marketing inputs and research and development projects raise costs in the short term
91588 conceive it believe it take aim to achieve it let go to the goddess prepare to receive it
91589 we are working with a lot of interested parties through the european broadcasting union we are getting a lot of feedback we are expected to do more field trials in the near future
91590 as a research project we by definition need to make things that others dont already have without needing to worry about business models
91591 give to get tries to obtain video blocks just in time for displaying tit for tat rewards people that give bandwidth to you which does not work in the streaming case instead give to get gives bandwidth to people that are nice to others this is more powerful but proved to be quite tricky to get working
91592 we hope that we can get this code solid and stable in a month
91593 then we can focus on the next milestone of sharing ratio enforcement where we give better video experience to those that upload more

91617 some people with the mutation have hearing loss in their 40s of the kind we normally see in people a decade or more older often identifying a gene in individuals who have early onset of a disorder will help explain why the disorder occurs in the general population
91618 in many types of hereditary hearing loss its likely that environmental factors that people can control such as smoking and exposure to noise also can influence how severe the hearing loss is and how early in life it begins
91619 i think this is interesting research as it shows a reasonably consistent effect the reduction in blood pressure is not trivial it is the same as gained from taking pills
91620 what we do not know is if garlic works as well as pills over the long term or if it would reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke but i was surprised at the extent of blood pressure reduction seen with garlic
91621 there is no harm in taking garlic along with other lifestyle factors such as eating less red meat less salt less alcohol and taking more exercise and also continuing to take blood pressure medication
91622 anyone could benefit from regular doses of garlic but it is important not to assume that taking supplements is all you need to treat high blood pressure

91687 by releasing these emails we hope to secure the privacy and personal integrity of all peer to peer users the emails contains sic information about the various tactics and technical solutions for tracking p2p users and disrupt p2p services we hope this is enough to create a viable defense to the tactics used by these companies
91688 how comfortable are you guys that your email server is free of uh other eyes
91689 oh yeah yeah weve checked out our email server and our email server itself has not been compromised
91690 in the beginning i had no motivation against monkey defenders
91691 it wasnt like i want to hack those bastards but then i found something and the good nature in me said these guys are not right im going to destroy them
91692 we showed him how we could block it from getting out onto the internet
91693 most users are likely individuals who in the absence of file sharing would not have bought the music they downloaded
91694 roughly half of all p2p tracks were downloaded because individuals wanted to hear songs before buying them or because they wanted to avoid purchasing the whole bundle of songs on the associated cds and roughly one quarter were downloaded because they were not available for purchase
91695 online piracy has got to be stopped the biggest spear in the neck of the pirates will be a being vigilant b prosecuting and c in a way making fun of them finding a way to say thats not anything but cool if you had people who the young people respect in this industry brad pitt george clooney shia labeouf if these guys did public service announcements that said dont steal stealings not cool i think you can go a long way toward stopping this

91707 our independent movie had next to no advertising budget and very little going for it until somebody ripped one of the dvd screeners and put the movie online for all to download people like our movie and are talking about it all thanks to piracy on the net
91708 in the future i will not complain about file sharing you have helped put this little movie on the map when i make my next picture i just may upload the movie on the net myself
91709 as a filmmaker i love that people love the movie and have seen the movie but as a person who literally has a hunk of his own life savings in the movie i dont want to be ripped off by people illegally downloading the movie some of these downloaders want to believe theyre fighting the man but were all just people who work for a living
91710 uh well they dont belong to me they are for my grandchildren
91711 john ralston has been an inspiration for us throughout our lives

91714 he has affected our lives so much just as he has your lives
91715 john modeled for all of his incredible character and dignity this man gave me my keys to the future

91719 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form
91720 written materials commonly referred to as pocket trash or pocket litter
91721 reasonable measures must be taken to protect business information and attorney client privileged material the policies say but there is no specific mention of the handling of personal data such as medical and financial records
91722 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
91723 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
91724 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
91725 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
91726 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
91727 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
91728 a very good friend and co worker of my moms lost everything last night in a fire including the two family dogs luckily everyone is okay but all they have now are the clothes they had on their backs it will be very rough for the family of five to get back on their feet if you have anything at your house that you were going to get rid of anyways that would help immensely
91729 letting go through intolerance and apathy one thing i have said over and over for several years is that the higher realms are not what you might think much of what we have been taught or read about is highly inaccurate although this is not a simple process basically it all boils down to simplicity and how energy responds and interacts with itself there are higher and lower forms of vibrating energy creating things that feel good and things that do not so then there is no meaning to anything meaning is simply what we choose to place on any particular manifestation some things may feel good to one person according to how they interpret them and may feel very unpleasant to another a rule of thumb then might be that things either feel good or they feel bad its that simple as we begin to vibrate higher and higher we become less and less of a match to what has been created so far on this planet and also to any lower vibrating aspects of other human behaviors and realities one might think that as we become more spiritual we embody a great compassion understanding and tolerance at higher levels than we ever have before but this is not the case as we progress through ascension and begin to vibrate higher and higher we find ourselves becoming highly intolerant of any lower vibrating energies we simply cannot be in their presence for very long and we may even become angry and frustrated with them as well there is a method to this madness as mentioned in earlier sections of this book there is a hierarchy to energetic levels and dimensions when we reach higher realities it is very difficult to reside or spend time in the lower realities we are simply not a match to them anymore this response also has other benefits the intolerance greatly encourages us to create more on the outside that matches how we are vibrating feeling and being on the inside if our outside reality feels downright awful we will most assuredly be inspired to save ourselves through our need to feel better by creating higher ways of living and being and by not tolerating and refusing to be a part of the old reality as we literally cannot stomach it anymore it makes us literally refuse to participate therefore withdrawing any energy of support if we do not become involved in something and negate it it cannot survive because there is no energy to make it real and alive it will simply cease to be as it will not be residing in anyones consciousness through this intolerance we are also being very direct as we progress into higher vibrating human beings we find that we can no longer beat around the bush sit by and watch or take a long winding road to get anywhere higher energy moves in a straight shot it does not go here and there make excuses and support friends and family even though they are in unhealthy situations or sit blindly by it is simple and direct no wishy washy uncertainty and passivity the time is up for tolerating the old and for waiting its the higher way or no way at some level we know this and at times can find ourselves addressing the lower vibrations very directly in this way this is a higher form of love it involves an inability to support the lower vibrations in anything we are actually being supportive and loving in that we are now supporting the highest ways through this intolerance we are actually being spiritual warriors of higher truth and greatly helping others in the higher realms we create through a partnership with source and as we are becoming more and more of source ourselves we must connect much more deeply now in order to create the higher ways during these years of ascension it can appear that we are getting absolutely nowhere it may seem that nothing ever goes our way or that we are receiving very little support for getting what we want this is really not the case we do not want to create things that are not of a higher vibration or that will no longer fit in the near future in other ways we cannot create from ego in the higher realms when we are not getting what we want it is usually because we wont be in that situation or reality very soon or that we are not yet ready if there is something that you really feel you must have then you are not ready to receive it it is ironic that we always get what we want when we no longer want it what is happening here is that we have lost our attachment which places us in a position for perfect creating in addition we are not then creating from our ego this is all part of the ascension process through it all we can get pretty discouraged at times when we get discouraged and let down over and over again and feel that all our dreams have shattered we become apathetic this is perfect it puts us into a space of letting go we simply do not care anymore this makes us let go and release the energy of attachment we are then residing in neutral energy with no agendas and this allows much more of source to enter and of course allows us to let go of many of the illusions
91730 curious form of idealism that disdains pride in britain and british culture preferring to give allegiance to a far more vaguely defined ideology of internationalism this rejection of national sovereignty and the subsequent embracing of unaccountable transnational institutions as advocated by our political establishment has led to the british people submitting to more and more authority which comes dressed as virtue
91731 i thought it was going into the stands the moment i hit it
91732 i think this number is worth praise for a man who is not a home run hitter
91733 politicizing the olympics goes against the olympic spirit and the shared aspirations of people all over the world
91734 there are various problems and divergent views in the world but politicizing the olympics will not lead to their solution
91735 i understand that japanese people hope to hold the olympics in tokyo in 2016 i wish tokyo luck
91736 of course when foreign reporters cover stories i hope they adhere to chinese laws and rules and maintain objectivity
91737 it went numb for a quick second but i got to the sideline and moved around and i was fine
91738 the one thing i pride myself on and i told them this unless something is broken im going to be on the practice field
91739 ive been in the league a long time so i have my own identity
91740 i dont really worry about what everybody else expects me to be i just try to be the corner i am thats all i can worry about i cant be asante i cant be ty law i cant be champ bailey i cant be anybody other than fernando my biggest thing is i think we have a good defensive scheme here and if i can fit in and do the things they want me to do i think ill be fine
91741 this is a bunch of great guys out here im sure they wont do anything to hurt us or anything like that
91742 whatever they have the rookies doing is no problem and ill do it
91743 if you take the time to get to know rodney harrison the player youd know that that is not my makeup thats not my personality i play hard its unfortunate that you have a stigma like that but what can you say even out on the field im not trying to hurt anyone im just playing hard
91744 i thought he would be the same off the field but its polar opposites
91745 to me thats an epitome of a great organization when youve got guys that work hard at all costs to win ballgames and can be great character people off the field
91746 i just turned and hit somebody and it happened to be him
91747 i think he made a lot of improvement last year during the course of the year
91748 he had a good offseason he had a good spring i think hes much better than he was last year at this time as you would expect and he continues to improve on a regular basis
91749 every one you catch you get a little bit more confidence in yourself and you start to put stuff behind you
91750 so every one that i get to put my hands on that i actually come up with its just going to be that much more of a confidence booster
91751 to be honest i just play whatever my coaches ask me to its not really a comfort level with safety
91752 its more of me just knowing what to do and how to do it
91753 i even had to tell him to shut up because he was trying to tell me how to do my job
91754 its nice to see from brandon obviously hes a very talented young man hes worked extremely hard this last year and as he gets older and his role increases hes going to become more vocal and hes definitely becoming a leader out there
91755 confidence in your playbook and confidence in the players around you having confidence in and knowing that what youre saying is right
91756 just to talk to him is a blessing ed reed is a good friend and everything i can learn from him i am
91757 i cant put that into words its a totally different brandon right now
91758 regeringen ligger som den har redt ingen andre eu lande behandler egne borgere s d rligt som danmark har gjort
91759 derfor er det ogs hykleri at komme at sige man er meget overrasket over at domstolen nu blander sig i det her n r man i revis faktisk har udnyttet at den endnu ikke havde gjort det
91760 det tjener som en afledningsman vre ministeren nsker ikke en stor debat om at de her regler ogs g lder for studerende det ville udstille at danmark har valgt en helt s rlig l sning p omr det
91761 hvis regeringen var konsekvent i forhold til det man nu siger kunne man allerede i 2004 v re taget til bruxelles og sagt at det her skal bestemmes af politikerne og ikke af domstolene

91766 we think the collapse was caused by a gas canister explosion in the building given the burns on the injured
91767 i think two issues are going to overshadow what both sides want to do one is the lingering feeling from the beef demonstrations and then this more recent territorial dispute over the dokdo islands
91768 certainly the president doesnt have much time and its somewhat of a legacy issue for him
91769 hes going to focus particularly on verification and moving forward with north korea and getting advice on that
91770 north korea can surprise it can surprise in all kinds of ways but they rarely meet a deadline
91771 without this action which we hope the north will take the delisting will not occur on that time line
91772 i think that it certainly didnt enhance the atmosphere for the visit but on the other hand the president has demonstrated leadership
91773 and we have a very very good relationship with the south korean people
91774 everything was done to make it as unpleasant and inaccessible as possible
91775 despite all this people kept coming to express their faith and pray to god that lithuania would be free
91776 in the soviet era there were believers who worked for the communist administration and who were ordered to destroy the crosses some refused they were given vodka so their conscience would slip
91777 its said that one who destroyed them had his hand amputated
91778 when i came back from siberia i planted a cross god gave us the gift of a wonderful family its a miraculous place
91779 im proud that we managed to keep putting up crosses in secret during soviet times and im proud that we can now do it openly
91780 we get tourists from around the world for some its just like going to a museum but many come here seeking the grace of god
91781 its like a cemetery for everyone you can come from anywhere and leave a cross even if the grave is elsewhere or you dont know where a loved one is buried
91782 this is astonishing i cant really understand it very well because for me religion is something personal but its made a big impression i really think that for people who lived here under communism it must have helped
91783 clearly you should have gotten a good old fashioned film camera
91784 just because its cheap doesnt mean its good you bought an olympus hahahaha
91785 would you look at that we live in different parts of the world dont resemble each other except one unimportant feature but we are brother and sister
91786 generoso bizarro y que sin fin particular ni tocar en el extremo de prodigalidad graciosamente da y socorre no s lo a los menesterosos sino a los que no lo son tanto haci ndoles todo bien
91787 y he de llevar mi libertad en peso sobre los propios hombros de mi gusto
91788 ser liberales es precisamente estas dos cosas primero estar dispuesto a entenderse con el que piensa de otro modo segundo no admitir jam s que el fin justifica los medios sino que por el contrario son los medios los que justifican el fin el liberalismo es pues una conducta y por tanto mucho m s que una pol tica y como tal conducta no requiere profesiones de fe sino ejercerla de un modo natural sin exhibirla ni ostentarla se debe ser liberal sin darse cuenta como se es limpio o como por instinto nos resistimos a mentir
91789 la eficacia del tribunal constitucional depende de la independencia de sus magistrados y de la no consideraci n del tribunal como una continuaci n de la pol tica por otras v as es posible que los magistrados tengan unas ciertas simpat as ideol gicas o determinados criterios sobre problemas econ micos sociales o culturales pero todo ello se pone entre par ntesis en el momento en el que se es juez esto no es s lo una condici n de la magistratura constitucional sino de todas las especies de magistraturas un juez puede tener un criterio sobre el divorcio pero cuando juzga un caso tendr que aplicar la ley y no otra cosa
91790 es fundamental que todos los actores de nuestra vida pol tica renuncien a la tentaci n de hacer del tribunal un rgano pol tico
91791 it was the first time they appeared at the court and its said that their trial will start on august 7 we dont know yet whether defense lawyers have been arranged for them or not
91792 family members are normally contacted but we have not been contacted by anyone so far we are really worried about them
91793 lets just go out to eat and you can buy me a drink or something
91794 you dont have to get me anything but if you really want to

91797 xgnp can either be used as an additive to plastics or by itself it can make a transformational change in the performance of many advanced electronic and energy devices it can do so because its a nanoparticle with a unique shape made from environmentally benign carbon and it can be made at a very reasonable cost
91798 its 2 0 to the wanderers 15 mins to go and man utd are down to 10 men
91799 and then i rounded the last defender and put in a perfect pass across the box to steve who buried the ball in the back of the net coach was saying that if i keep up this form during the practice and reserve matches i might even be able to make the 1st team because the midfield needs some pace
91800 ok well i want the two of you to get ready for bed and then you can come back down and watch television for another hour

91808 max you are trying out for the football team ive told coach carter that you should definately be good enough to get into the reserves ill see you there

91828 biodiesel was so uncommon in the area when the station opened in 2006 clements said that officials were often unclear about how to apply fuel regulations to it leaving whole energy to believe it fell within city and state regulations

91837 when i first started coming over here the order was knives little spoons big spoons forks now its knives forks big spoons little spoons the other day it was knives big spoons forks little spoons why do you keep changing it
91838 this shows our claims on emissions are simply a big lie
91839 the government has known about this for a very long time but has just refused to face up to it
91840 there is no way the government can hope to achieve any of its emissions targets without cheating unless it changes its policies on encouraging flying and hoping to satisfy peoples insatiable demands for buying more and more stuff
91841 it cant be absolutely precise but it is a best estimate of where we are it is very much in line with other studies on the subject so we are fairly confident of it it is very interesting background information
91842 would not want to be held to an international target on it
91843 holding china and india responsible for emissions from manufactured goods they sell to us is going to prove very hard to negotiate
91844 it would be much easier to base any future deal on emissions at the point of consumption that feeds into the equity debate in which poor countries will be allowed to increase their co2
91845 its at the very least misleading for the uk government to claim reductions while we export our emissions this is a problem no government wants to face
91846 in emissions terms we are constantly battling against increases of wealth every year we dont even manage to improve our energy efficiency to keep up with wealth increases let alone to cut emissions
91847 theres a very fundamental problem here that no one really wants to talk about

91888 body language accounts for over half of the way that we communicate with others
91889 if people are open minded and want to change the way that they are coming across to others thats the most important starting point
91890 i very rarely meet people who are as bad as they think they are in terms of their body language normally i find that a few small improvements do make a difference
91891 many people work in open plan offices so they need to be aware of what their expression is saying about them and perhaps take a minute or two to soften it
91892 a lot of people turn up to work in the morning with faces that show the stress of their journey its definitely worth pausing for a minute before walking into the office and just taking that time to soften your expression relax your shoulders and stand upright
91893 otherwise you walk into the room looking stressed and someone picks up on that and responds to you in a similar way then both of you start off the day on the wrong footing
91894 i dont want to talk myself out of a job but i do say to readers that theyre actually already experts in body language
91895 its known that within 15 minutes of being born humans are using body language to be able to survive
91896 its only when we were growing up that our parents start telling us that its rude to stare and then we also start using social masking so we dont reveal too much about ourselves the skills are still there but were not as tuned into them what i do as a body language expert is slow the process down and become more analytical
91897 most people have heard that if someone folds their arms they are being defensive and stand offish
91898 this might be true in some cases but it might just mean that someone is feeling cold similarly its said that if someone touches their nose then they are lying it could just be that they have an itchy nose
91899 its all about context if you take a word out of a sentence then it is out of context and the same applies with body language its a complex and fascinating subject and i think that over simplifying it can mean that people go away with the wrong idea
91900 they do all of this patting and clutching of hands that maybe implies closeness but is actually about one politician stamping his authority over the other barack obama before she pulled out of the democratic race while shaking hands with her he was patting her on the bicep and she had this frozen stare on her face because she knew what signal he was giving
91901 hes quite retentive and anything relaxed seems to really wrong foot him as we recently saw with the hiphop handshake that
91902 gordon browns fingers ended up going up bushs sleeve and it was very awkward
91903 he comes across as this home town boy and a smile is never far away from his face
91904 he creates a kind of cognitive dissonance in peoples minds because what he is saying may have a negative message but the expression on his face doesnt match it its very confusing for the viewer and i think its what created his votability
91905 ive met people who overkill the eye contact thing and even seem to have learnt the skill of not blinking
91906 too much of it comes across as aggressive theres no harm in nodding and looking away briefly when youre listening to someone
91907 you dont have to go to extremes and create a storm by throwing your hair around
91908 subtlety is by far the better message looking someone in the eye looking away and then smiling at them is usually the best way to send a signal

91950 well help you commit suicide since we cant afford to keep you alive
91951 there are things you can do individually though to save energy
91952 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
91953 in this context the classic remedy of more speech rings hollow those who are supposed to respond cannot even when these victims speak their words lack authority it is as though they said nothing

91955 the main issue most of us are worried about is the road safety tight small narrow road with a steep windy drop down into our valley
91956 they would have to go right by ag high school lot of kids just learning how to drive and pulling out in front of a big oil tanker could be potentially hazardous and on highway one pulling up on the mesa its a tricky thing there

91958 mr harrison believed that mr mays was reaching for a gun to shoot him
91959 under the circumstances of mr mays verbal threats aggressive approach toward mr harrison and action of lifting his shirt and reaching his hand toward his waistband mr harrisons belief was reasonable
91960 we believe this incident falls within the parameters of self defense and that the shooting was justified
91961 the whole thing seems to have been pretty quick i dont think mr harrison had time to deliberate about anything
91962 its fair to say he wishes the whole thing hadnt happened
91963 renee how have you been taking a vacation from your dreary little life in the atl

91978 en los casos de cancelaci n de vuelos las compa as suelen alegar circunstancias extraordinarias a fin de evitar compensar a los pasajeros entre dichas circunstancia se encuentran los fallos t cnicos en la aeronave o el riesgo a la segurdiad no ofrecer ninguna compensaci n al respecto

91990 this will not attract art lovers it will attract voyeurs which is not good for brisbane or women in general

91997 we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
91998 worked in a pet store part time and listened to a radio station every day that played three songs and asked the listeners to guess what they had in common
91999 it was a twist on trivia but it was still trivia
92000 someone asked how long it would take us to drive to the florida keys and the light bulb went off
92001 hey what else has keys besides florida i asked that became our first riddle clue florida a locksmith a piano
92002 that was the moment when the game really became something fun
92003 i guess playing for a living was always a big pull for me
92004 i didnt want to be stuck in another job wondering what if
92005 i didnt make the teams but i fell in love with the area so i stayed

92007 you got 15 minutes in the whirlpool id quiz you with these three clue riddles have to ride a stationery bike for 20 minutes id quiz you with these three clue riddles
92008 of course we were selling them from the trunks of our cars that whole time too

92014 they were laughing and learning and i asked my girlfriend if i could borrow the childrens dictionary
92015 is that the teacher is now my wife of 13 years
92016 i found that virtually every hit toy or game was designed by people tinkering in their basements or garages
92017 the inventors are so unappreciated these people have touched countless lives through their creations yet very few others know who they are i thought the book could help change that
92018 they have so much invested emotionally in their baby that it makes for very compelling story telling
92019 i knew that their sixtieth anniversary was approaching so i sought them out and they agreed to open up their archives to me
92020 they were just fearless and fun in their approach to toy making
92021 its tough especially with the consolidation of the industry and the proliferation of media outlets
92022 having said that there still seems to be a breakout toy or game every few years like apples to apples that fuels the creativity of the next wave of inventors
92023 its a fun industry and alluring in that regard but its also a 22 billion industry and the professionals in it take their fun very seriously
92024 people go bankrupt for real and they dont lose monopoly money
92025 i think the energy and struggle of creating is much more interesting and rewarding then the selling
92026 sooner or later though you have to sell your idea to someone whos willing to pay you
92027 if the trend continues there wont be any elephants except in fenced areas with a lot of enforcement to protect them

92034 the timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything
92035 after wednesdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
92036 after taking a few different exams and mris the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
92037 there are so many mixed feelings because on wednesday night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious
92038 but after thursday mornings tests for the first time in a while they were able to give me a different answer and a different problem
92039 this is something that needs a lot of time to heal it really hurts me to say i have to miss the olympics
92040 he only lost two points on the last set thats terrible for the tennis
92041 right now i know im in a good position because roger has to win everything from here from olympics to us open
92042 but i dont think too much right now i only think about trying to improve my game for tomorrow
92043 its disappointing losing without getting broken but its not the first player it has happened to especially to a guy like ivo
92044 theres always danger in tough matches against ivo i knew that from the start
92045 i guess ill analyse and assess my game after the us open
92046 for the moment its just all a blur so many tournaments in a row big tournaments in a row its hard
92047 its a tough trip weve got up in front of us now going back to china and coming back to the open
92048 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again i hope i can manage to pull off something in the next couple of weeks
92049 i havent played against top 10 players so much in my career so beating one of them gives me more confidence

92102 the ioc coordination commission and bocog met last night and agreed
92103 there are quite a few lads who adopted quickly to the conditions over there and that was a welcome sign as it is very important to get adjusted to a new environment while touring abroad though i don t like to take names i think the tournament was a good exposure to young players from india australia south africa and new zealand
92104 i was impressed with indian lads batting on semi worn out wickets our batsmen showed lot of character particularly against the fast bowlers in fact even our bowlers did extremely well though the boys could not win the one day tournament i am satisfied with the overall performance of the team
92105 my main motive of going to australia was to see and build a strong a team because it is difficult to judge the standard of a player in the domestic matches when we go out and play in australia new zealand or south africa then we get a clear cut idea of our players standard
92106 such tours also help our players to raise their game and i personally think that building a strong a team is very essential as australia south africa and even new zealand have strong second string players to replace their main players when the need be

92113 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier with trying to make the club better at this point in time than to do this we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
92114 i didnt keep records or verify the cultures because i was concerned that records might be obtained under the freedom of information act
92115 i was also afraid that reporting would have raised great alarm within the institute which at the time was very busy

92195 manganese is an element found naturally in the body in addition the manganese in the nanobialys is tied up so it stays with the particles making them very safe
92196 when we looked at the particles with an electron microscope we saw they are round and flat with a dimple in the center like red blood cells but also a little irregular like bagels
92197 i came across the word bialy which is a polish roll like a bagel without a hole that can be made with different toppings so i called the particles nanobialys
92198 even though it seems that gadolinium affects only those with severe renal failure physicians have decided not to use gadolinium even in those with moderate renal failure
92199 a lot of patients with diabetes or hypertension develop renal failure so that decision potentially affects many people our goal has always been that our nanoparticle technology should be able to help everyone and with a growing number of people having diabetes and related cardiovascular problems we knew we needed to find a substitute for gadolinium based particles nanobialys are our first step in that direction
92200 were not sitting in the lab generating nanoparticles and then looking for what they could be used for
92201 we see a medical problem and ask what kind of particle might overcome it and then try to create it

92204 finding cobble deposits will enable us to determine the lakes water level in those times and draw palaeoclimatic conclusions which is of great interest in the light of the climate change the world is experiencing nowadays
92205 i have to admit our institute has forwarded to gazprom a blueprint of a gas pipeline to be built across lake baikal like the blue stream in the black sea and the north european gas pipeline
92206 to guarantee environmental safety we have to explore the lake bottom gazprom hasnt responded yet but this does not influence our mission as our primary interest lies in fundamental issues
92207 the record was registered on the offices grounds between 5 00 pm and 6 00 pm 1700 gmt its the hottest temperature recorded in reykjavik
92208 the results are what we expected to find given the changes in climate over the last 20 years
92209 because the uk is in the middle latitudes of europe we expected that recent climatic warming would favour species with ranges located in the south of europe and adversely affect northern species
92210 the presence of a linear field of geothermal features is evidence of a planar rift extending to considerable depth in the crust
92211 this new evidence indicates that the region is more complicated than we previously thought
92212 the extension of the san andreas does not appear to be active it is probably a very old part of the fault and helps to explain the larger more complex transition area between the imperial fault and san andreas fault called the brawley seismic zone
92213 what is clear is that by targeting an element involved directly in the infective process we may develop a line of drugs that work in collaboration with rather than in difference to the host environment including host immune responses
92214 hopefully this kind of approach can help solve the ongoing problem of bacterial drug resistance
92215 using novel techniques we have identified a key membrane protein thats essential to the defense that m tuberculosis mounts against the acidic environment of immune cells called macrophages without this protein called rv3671c the bacterium becomes vulnerable to acidification and is killed
92216 m tuberculosis does not depend on rv3671c under standard growth conditions in the test tube so it has been overlooked as a candidate drug target
92217 however when m tuberculosis infects the host then the rv3671c protein becomes essential
92218 this is an example of a new class of potential targets for anti infective agents
92219 those that the pathogen only needs in order to survive in the host environment
92220 thats exactly what we sought to do in this research
92221 thats a huge change from standard anti infective research which typically deals with the pathogen simply replicating in culture
92222 in our experiments we wanted to see if biochemical actors would emerge in the infective process that might be inoperative in the usual in vitro setting
92223 as part of this process the phagosome becomes acidic which is thought to contribute to its ability to break down and destroy the pathogen
92224 however m tuberculosis appears to survive the acidification process keeping its own internal ph stable
92225 what we observed was pretty amazing without functioning rv3671c the mutant bacterium was easily destroyed in a low ph environment both in culture and inside the more acidic environment of the macrophage
92226 this revealed a new point of vulnerability for the bacterium
92227 the ability to make those kinds of measurements will expand research into this type of host pathogen interaction
92228 right now we have very little idea of the mechanism at work here perhaps as an enzyme rv3671c cleaves a transcription regulator that then turns on some kind of defensive program within the bacterium only further study will reveal those secrets
92229 what is clear is that by targeting an element involved directly in the infective process we may develop a line of drugs that work in collaboration with rather than in difference to the host environment including host immune responses
92230 hopefully this kind of approach can help solve the ongoing problem of bacterial drug resistance
92231 in the ideal collaboration each participant brings key insights from their particular discipline to the table
92232 we found that in 2005 fully one third of chinas greenhouse gas emissions were due to production of exports this proportion has risen quickly from 12 percent in 1987 and only 21 percent in 2002
92233 it is clear that urgent improvements are needed especially in chinas electricity sector
92234 installing more renewable power and overcoming the financial and technological hurdles involved with new technologies such as carbon sequestration should be the first priority of both china and its export partners
92235 thirty people have been killed 23 drowned three were struck by lightning three were electrocuted and one died in a landslide
92236 scientists knew panama was a north american peninsula possibly as early as 19 million years ago because fossils that are closely related to north american land mammals such as rhinos horses peccaries and dogs have been found in the panama canal during ongoing maintenance
92237 but we were not certain when this peninsula first formed and how long it may have existed
92238 however these short lived straits probably had little impact on the long term evolution of central americas flora and fauna
92239 we realized there was a problem with our previous understanding of the stratigraphy or layering of sediments in panama
92240 theres always missing information like pages out of a book when it comes to figuring out which layers came first and which were formed later
92241 they have made an important contribution to the land based geologic evidence of the plate tectonic history of the formation of the isthmus
92242 their results have important consequences for the nature of the global change engendered by the rise and closure of the isthmus
92243 the strengthened gulf stream in turn delivered enough moisture to allow the formation of glaciers across north america
92244 a 25 percent drop in fertility is the equivalent of a 25 percent drop in the reproductive population it remains to be seen whether other species exhibit the same effect but translated to commercially and ecologically important species such as lobsters crabs mussels and fish acidification would have far reaching consequences
92245 species with limestone skeletons or shells are hit particularly hard when the ph drops through a drop in ability to grow and a rise in mortality but and its a big but we dont yet know enough about the effects of acidification in the sea and i hope im wrong about the wider consequences of our results
92246 i can usually tell a man is not ready for commitment by his behavior i usually can tell he is not ready if he is selfish in his action if it is all about him all the time i feel that anyone that is selfish could not be ready for a relationship which requires giving of yourself your time energy and heart that person only has the ability to love themselves and no one else a selfish acting man is always looking for the next best thing and will eventually leave for greener pastures he wants to get more than what he is getting now
92247 i have been told that i am a nice looking woman but i have noticed men have roaming eyes no matter how nice the women they are with looks when i am talking to guy and he is looking around at every woman that pass by that lets me know he is not totally focused on me
92248 and i believe that if a man is ready to commit to you he will show it in the time he spends with you

92263 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
92264 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
92265 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
92266 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
92267 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
92268 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
92269 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
92270 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
92271 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
92272 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
92273 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
92274 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
92275 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
92276 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
92277 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
92278 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
92279 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
92280 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
92281 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
92282 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
92283 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
92284 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
92285 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
92286 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
92287 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
92288 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
92289 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
92290 you have value on the ground more than you spent
92291 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
92292 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
92293 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
92294 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
92295 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
92296 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one

92301 its important that people learn from this situation they could lookfor another house and it could be anywhere
92302 we didnt want this to be a case of well were placated we want to send a message
92303 the responsibility of solving problems falls on the shoulders of the people who live on the block

92314 let me put you on the spot with this problem
92315 deep packet inspection refers to the fact that these boxes dont simply look at the header information as packets pass through them rather they move beyond the ip and tcp header information to look at the payload of the packet the goal is to identify the applications being used on the network but some of these devices can go much further those from a company like narus for instance can look inside all traffic from a specific ip address pick out the http traffic then drill even further down to capture only traffic headed to and from gmail and can even reassemble e mails as they are typed out by the user
92316 layer 7 is the application layer the actual messages sent across the internet by programs like firefox or skype or azureus by stripping off the headers deep packet inspection devices can use the resulting payload to identify the program or service being used procera for instance claims to detect more than 300 application protocol signatures including bittorrent http ftp smtp and ssh ellacoya reps tell ars that their boxes can look deeper than the protocol identifying particular http traffic generated by youtube and flickr for instance of course the identification of these protocols can be used to generate traffic shaping rules or restrictions

92323 i had some problems but weve turned things around and i am quite happy with how it is going so far
92324 i have to say the backing ive had during these weeks and months from the team has been very good
92325 that has helped me to know they stand behind me because i have worked hard with the engineers to overcome the problems and it has worked
92326 things have changed a lot probably since canada although i still had qualifying problems there i had good race pace and could have won
92327 since then qualifying has been better apart from at hockenheim where i made a mistake
92328 but over the weekend the result was good and without the mistake i would have made it into the top 10
92329 i did the fastest race lap again like earlier in the season in malaysia and i have had two second places in four races
92330 so i am really happy to have finally turned things around
92331 that does surprise me and it makes me quite happy
92332 it shows in a phase that i struggled i was still able to take some points
92333 one of my targets now is to finish ahead of robert by the end of the season
92334 last year i finished fifth in the drivers championship with a car clearly worse than this years so i want to go one better
92335 of course i want to beat my team mate as everyone does but the target is fourth place it will not be easy but thats my target
92336 it is very unlikely but it doesnt mean in my mind there is zero percent chance
92337 you take it as it comes you just try to give it your best

92371 now that the secretary general of the united nations mr kofi annan has sealed the deal made between the presidents of nigeria cameroon and the companies exploring oil over the blood of the bakassi people the die is cast therefore bamosd now declares as follows
92372 that our peaceful social economic historical and ancestral ties with the rest of the people of the niger delta leave us not only with no other frontier but with no other option than to join forces with the valiant and heroic freedom fighters of the niger delta
92373 that bamosd by this declaration is subsuming all its activities on the bakassi peninsula into the larger war of liberation of the nigeria delta under the joint leadership of the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta mend and other joints commands for the protection defence and security of its people and resources

92399 california voters recognize this is a modest reform and that all animals including those raised for food deserve humane treatment
92400 californians have a long history of very progressive attitudes towards animals and have a commitment to outlawing animal cruelty where it exists
92401 if the hens are uncomfortable if they are too hot or too cold or dont get enough water or dont like their feed the first thing that gets hit is egg production
92402 people have the idea that cage free is healthier but its not the hens sometimes lay eggs in the manure on the ground sometimes they eat it if one is sick its impossible to catch and remove it another problem with so many hens living together is cannibalism
92403 we had planned 12 cage free buildings but we only put up six because demand is not there
92404 the supporters of prop 2 are asking us to throw all that away so chickens can spread their wings but that doesnt make birds healthier sometimes what is better for a hen isnt always what you think it might be
92405 put our family out of business and all that will happen is that egg production will be driven out of california to mexico where standards are lower
92406 people get it we would never keep our pets in cages so small they couldnt turn around and farm animals dont deserve that misery either
92407 people want to eat animals raised for food but they want them to be treated like pets they are not pets to us but their livelihood is in our best interests

92416 everybody sees china as this monster polluter but it is doing so much more than that
92417 china is already leading in certain types of technologies in the power sector it is in clean coal solar wind in transport it is developing more efficient compact cars and electric cars
92418 developed countries really need to demonstrate their sincerity demonstrate the feasibility of the solutions really demonstrate that they are serious about this
92419 telling developing countries that they must do it when they themselves are not is just not acceptable
92420 in china the top leadership are all of the same mindset china opened up 30 years ago but our economic miracle was driven by intense resource use that produced great pollution and recently unrest
92421 that is fully understood the leadership has been thinking about a new pathway they know they cant repeat the path of the past they know it has to be clean it has to be more efficient low carbon has now been integrated into this new pathway
92422 china has got the green message companies are making profits in pushing forward the low carbon economy
92423 the thinking in china is that there is no doubt that in 20 or 30 years time china will be a world leader
92424 to be a respected responsible leader of the world we have to start thinking now about what we should do to lead up to the day when china has to lead and will be able to lead well climate change is one of the key issues there

92430 youre doing exactly what logical reasonable people are taught to do to take care of themselves
92431 privacy is respected and guaranteed in china chinas security measures in hotels and other public places are not beyond the internationally generally used measures
92432 we find that the draft manual seeks to introduce software patents and we believe this is not in consonance with the current legal situation which states that
92433 neither the controller nor the central government has authority or sanction of law to publish a manual of the kind put on the website
92434 the sole purpose of asserting defensively in the event of a future lawsuit
92435 the two authorities intend to collect data and analyze information and documents on prices and offers for the both kind of
92436 i was emailed the presentation of the monetary statement and i was appalled that those in charge of the financial woes in zimbabwe have chosen to blame sanctions on zimbabwe they refuse entirely to admit that the sanctions in place are targeted and lay the blame squarely at the feet of the western powers i was disgusted when i read that they claim the freezing of accounts in germany have stopped the shipment of food they claim for the children old and infirm but in reality we know that the food was tagged to arrive for distribution among the zanu pf bigwigs mugabe will say anything at anytime to avoid the blame there is total commitment on the part of the government and zanu pf and myself to see the speedy conclusion and successful outcome of the talks so that we can all focus on the recovery of our economy
92437 you put your proposals on the table find room for compromise but sometimes you stand by your proposal and you need to continue with the debate until you find a compromise
92438 things are not quite that easy but i understand that they talks are going quite well they have gone through the first stage there are other stages to come some that require leaders to be there and we hope we will get to that stage
92439 two weeks may appear as too short but its not inflexible im sure that the facilitators will adjust as the progress moves forward
92440 shall not be rendered void in the interest of democracy peace security and stability even if corrupt or illegal practices were committed

92442 no you jack ass you did this to yourself when you slept with the idiot get over it pack up your emotions heal and find someone you actually connect with emotionally spiritually and intellectually the physical comes last
92443 despite everything this is a good day for turkey and for europe
92444 there is a vast majority among the turkish people who are in favour of european values im sure this played a role as stated by the president of the turkish constitutional court

92455 given that bacterial vaginosis and hiv infection are both transmitted sexually it is difficult to determine whether associations found are causal or if there is some other reason why women with bv are more likely that others to become infected with hiv
92456 if additional follow up studies show that there was a relationship between bv and the risk of incident hiv infection though then increasing the treatment of bv could be considered for the future prevention of hiv infection

92476 ist immer der eigene anspruch der nur vom herzen kommen kann und dessen formulierung sorgf ltig erwogen sein will
92477 for individuals looking at these range of accounts the interest is not the motivating factor
92478 the quakers supporter account was one of the first football affinity accounts in the country and is an instant access account with no restrictions on withdrawals or the size of the investment
92479 most account holders also have other savings accounts with darlington building society which pay interest at rates of up to 8 per cent but the quakers supporter is the only account designed to provide financial support to quakers fans favourite team
92480 from time to time the football club has also provided additional benefits to quakers supporter account holders and these have ranged from discounts off club merchandise to discounted season tickets
92481 we tracked down all the people in the footage and got in touch with their parents immediately
92482 one of the boys is shown wearing a knuckle duster at a bus stop we worked out where the bus stop was straight away and were able to find out who he was
92483 we contacted the parents of everybody in the video and made them come down for a talk we showed them the footage and talked to them about the problems with gang culture and the dangers of using weapons
92484 they need to know the kind of image this projects
92485 they might think they are being cool by pretending to be gangsters but potential employers could see this rival gangs could see it too and that could lead to more violence
92486 the footage is apparently still on you tube but steps are in hand to have it removed
92487 if anyone posts footage on you tube or similar sites which show or appear to show criminal offences then there is a likelihood they will be traced
92488 the solution that i propose is straightforward and simple free universal locally sourced hot school lunches given to all pupils under the age of 16
92489 for the most disadvantaged children a school dinner can be their only hot meal some of our poorest children are missing out which is outrageous
92490 this is the thin end of the wedge it represents a dangerous threat to services in remote communities everywhere and it must be stopped
92491 the road is extremely narrow and if you have to reverse down this is potentially an accident is waiting to happen
92492 luckily i have a friend in langthwaite and i have arranged for my letters to go there rather than to richmond
92493 this is a basic service that we expect it is unbelievable that we are just being cut off like this
92494 if i cant rely on the postal service i dont see how i can continue to work from home
92495 this is a real blow for the rural economy which is already suffering what business is going to come and set up here if they cant even be sure theyll get their post
92496 a health and safety assessment was undertaken and the report confirmed that access to a number of premises is a risk to our staff and as a result deliveries were suspended
92497 affected customers have been made aware of the issue and we have agreed with them to deliver their mail temporarily to an alternative address of their choice while arrangements are made for royal mail to provide as a gesture of goodwill roadside boxes which will become their permanent delivery point
92498 there were a number of people in the area at the time who witnessed the incident but we need to talk to everyone who was in and around the mcdonalds takeaway at 10pm
92499 they may have seen this robbery or two men acting suspiciously shortly beforehand
92500 we also want to speak to people who may have seen the vauxhall astra driving from the car park and out towards durham tees valley airport
92501 the car was torched within half an hour of being stolen again people may have seen this or two men running from the vehicle
92502 matters came to a head when after his neighbour enlisted the assistance of the police the defendant reacted by breaking a window with a hammer and when it was repaired spray painting it
92503 he would have his headphones on listening to people abusing him
92504 he has been receiving assistance for his problems he has a good job and his partner is standing by him
92505 we want to preserve our prices for the customers and at the moment there are no plans in place
92506 well be watching the markets and seeing what happens and trying to delay doing something as long as we can
92507 i think its inevitable our prices will go up the plan is to protect as long as we can
92508 we have the same problems with the overseas markets as everyone else
92509 british gas customers still reeling from 35 per cent price hikes might have expected centrica to be losing money
92510 they will be staggered at the rude health of centricas half year profits
92511 clearly almost a billion pounds of profit in six months isnt enough for centrica so it has raised gas prices by 35 per cent
92512 uk consumers are paying the price of broken energy markets in europe and at home
92513 the government needs to recognise that if the era of cheap energy is over then the era of cheap solutions to fuel poverty is over as well
92514 we are able to announce plans for a significant increase in investment with modest price rises that we believe most customers will continue to find both affordable and excellent value for money
92515 the people this will affect the most are the vulnerable and elderly and theres concern that these people will not be able to keep up with payments
92516 zeig mir deine freunde und ich sage dir wer du bist
92517 for me this piece is about discovery and its aftermath
92518 im also interested in the idea of measuring the landscape and topography suggested by it
92519 the challenge for contemporary artists working through the richly explored history of light within visual art is to find ways to pioneer while crossing such well traversed artistic terrain kempinas shotz and temple all meet this challenge with extraordinary creativity and aesthetic capability and it is particularly satisfying to bring these three artists together at sfmoma a museum connected through both its architecture and collection to the effects of light on space
92520 we are very pleased by what is being put on the table it will bring about a new wave of soft cheeses and raise them to a completely new gustatory level
92521 at that point the cheese is creamy a lot more flavourful and more complex at the level of aroma
92522 i find it bizarre because this is common in europe but when you talk about it in canada theyre afraid
92523 he was very nice every time i had conversations with him
92524 were going to be more on guard were going to pay closer attention to our children
92525 i hope the law will make whoever did this pay for what they did
92526 we see this in montreal we see this in quebec city we see this in big cities but not in small places
92527 caron is a people person and she got to know a lot of people and she knew the issues too
92528 its a frame construction with aluminum siding and had been rebuilt around the original cottage we turned the lower level into a bedroom and bathroom
92529 it can be 30 below outside and the stove will give off enough heat that we have to open the windows
92530 when our neighbours cottage burnt down we loaned them our truck tent and they lived in it that summer
92531 then when my boat sank they let me know and helped me arrange to have it towed and repaired
92532 theres prep time and then the driving to get there
92533 you can only tax people so much there are a lot of retirees who own property there and that has to be taken into account
92534 really appreciate the amount of work she puts into her role as councillor
92535 is very much appreciated she works by conference call and other ways since she is often far away our area is 155 square kilometres with 105 lakes and only 2 000 houses
92536 people who come here and build are very concerned about the quality of the water and other elements
92537 they have a big investment and they are willing to pay for it sometimes we have big debates
92538 property owners who have lived here all their lives would like to see a bit more development
92539 newer people would like to be the last ones to come here and build
92540 during the ceremony the pews will face one way and after that we will all go outside where during the cocktail hour we will be entertained by a fellow from la chute who plays the fiddle then we will go back inside where everything will be rearranged for a dinner

92576 companies that sell stuff have spent huge sums training us to think stuff is still valuable but it would be closer to the truth to treat stuff as worthless
92577 it came out years ago and no one liked it then
92578 now its the rage im like its my obsession but its everyones obsession
92579 seems like weve got something every summer but i cant think of anything as popular as harry potter and twilight
92580 so we started a reading list for if you liked twilight read this
92581 you have this realistic world but something fantastic happens in it
92582 it was the accepted knowledge that teens wanted quick and easy formulaic
92583 now from anecdotal evidence young adult fiction is the fastest growing genre
92584 what authors are able to say now is so much broader
92585 before it was elaborate chapter books now you have things like mercedes lackey writing about gay love
92586 there was realistic fiction in the days of the baby sitters club but reality now is different the growing sophistication of the literature parallels the sophistication that you see in teens that you talk to
92587 has captivated the interest of so many teens its helped them discover reading
92588 you know no one ever reads the same book theres such a unique connection between a writer and reader we each have our own reactions our own emotions
92589 i have a hard time forgetting so i cant read something more than once and feel like its new
92590 but the way she writes well i forget ive read the book before its so beautiful to read again

92612 n o estou zangado mas fiquei decepcionado com a posi o que o presidente da rep blica adoptou na revis o do estatuto da sua atitude resulta claramente um transporte de raz es para aqueles que t m tido comportamentos mais radicais na abordagem destas quest es das autonomias
92613 this is an old charge that karadzic started in 1996
92614 such a deal would have been immoral and unethical it obviously didnt happen
92615 ambassador holbrooke and we have repeatedly made clear that no agreement was ever made in which radovan karadzic was provided immunity from prosecution or arrest
92616 and in order to explain this to his own people he put the story out then and he has embroidered it over 12 years but there is zero truth to it i have testified to that account
92617 if holbrooke still wants my death and regrets there is no death sentence at this court i want to know if his arm is long enough to reach me here
92618 what i said was that i know that the hague does not have a death penalty but if anybody deserves the death penalty its radovan karadzic because he was responsible directly or indirectly for 300 000 deaths

92624 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
92625 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
92626 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
92627 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public
92628 if its too dangerous to touch it cant be clean
92629 im sick of those tsa nuts making us strip at the airport what does tsa stand for those stupid assholes
92630 so much worse could happen but it makes you feel like youve been invaded someone is taking liberties on your property that you would never take with anyone else

92637 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public
92638 if you read the literature it says the vipers bites are pretty benign
92639 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad
92640 i dont understand how they could do this to a fallen hero and his family who were experiencing so much pain and still are
92641 not only did she lose her child now how is she going to afford to bury him when marcs grandfather went to the bank to show the newspaper article he gets told to leave i am shocked that this was handled so insensitively
92642 this is not the intent of the government when they issue these checks the checks are designed to help comfort the family not add stress and worry
92643 we want an investigation and if this is a policy we want to change it or make an exception so parents can cash these checks in 30 minutes
92644 i am sure every institution has their own procedures but they have to abide by the regulations
92645 i felt the banks refusal to cash the bereavement check showed disrespect to my grandson and my family
92646 even though i showed them a photo from the newspaper of my daughter marcs mother crying over his loss they still refused to cash it before the funeral i hope they will never make anyone else suffer what we had to endure because of their insensitivity to us
92647 the fire started from s 10 coach of the gautami express at around 1 10 am local time 2040 gmt

92650 hasbro has an obligation to protect its intellectual property and will act appropriately when necessary
92651 we evaluate every situation on a case by case basis and have no comment regarding the scrabulous developers new application at this time
92652 i do think the cosmetic changes on the new wordscraper board and the removal of any links to scrabble rules or dictionaries help dodge the copyright bullet
92653 by giving the power to the end users to control the design of the board including presumably the ability to change the board design back to the scrabulous design hasbro could still pursue a contributory infringement claim if it wanted to under the active inducement test
92654 but to win hasbro would have to show that the designers actively encouraged gamers to change the board back to the old scrabulous so far they dont seem to be stepping over this line
92655 but i really missed the trash talking with friends there are some friends i dont get to see that much but i played scrabulous with them
92656 all of my friends are really upset with hasbro and electronic arts and they didnt want to have anything to do with the game
92657 and when i tried to fiddle with it it crashed on me so i gave up

92663 i am not aware of any ability by our agents to waive an excess baggage fee even for military personnel since they already have the common checked bag fees waived in our policy
92664 otherwise our policy is very generous as you can see and intentionally so were very proud of our military forces so were pleased to be able to help

92690 it is a terrible situation to be in i dont think any governor wants to be in this situation but this is really the only way out at this point
92691 the state of california the elected leadership cannot put the important public servants of california in harms way
92692 we put people first we make sure we protect their interests and thats why i have to tell the governor with all due respect i am not going to comply with this order
92693 people are going to get put out of their homes
92694 the governor says hes sorry we cant pay with sorry
92695 we believe budget reform is an essential element and we also appreciate there may be some tax loopholes that need to be closed
92696 patience is one of the characteristics of monastic life but even the patience of the brothers was being tested by our slow internet
92697 broadband access has made a huge difference to our internet usage
92698 we knew we needed a faster connection but we had almost given up trying to find a workable solution which would give us an internet connection at speeds enjoyed by others on the mainland
92699 we have many plans to develop our commercial activities now we have a modern high speed communications link
92700 we are absolutely delighted to have been able to provide the community at caldey abbey with state of the art wireless broadband access
92701 its crucial to our needs and broadband will help the speed up things
92702 the world has abandoned a fortress mentality in the real world and we need to move beyond it in cyberspace america needs a network that can project power by building an af mil robot network botnet that can direct such massive amounts of traffic to target computers that they can no longer communicate and become no more useful to our adversaries than hunks of metal and plastic america needs the ability to carpet bomb in cyberspace to create the deterrent we lack

92704 you cannot create a culture of innovation without creating a culture of collaboration and at its core is creating a culture of trust with people you may never have met
92705 the page can be a place to spread the buzz about the event and get people talking about it through the comments feature
92706 its also a handy place to keep track of who is invited and whos rsvped and to share photos and reminisce about the event afterward
92707 one of our goals is to create a smaller company in spite of our size
92708 beehive has done more than anything than create a sense of community at
92709 we hypothesized that lists in an enterprise would be used to discuss opinions and share information related to the work context e
92710 several times i did it with my team like people writing to me and im writing to them saying did you see that thing on beehive sending the link
92711 the interview data from the internal study suggests that people need not feel any particular connection to the person whose list they reuse
92712 while we found that reuse in itself is not always a social act there are some reuse trees that have sparked many conversations and have formed ad hoc interest groups

92716 nachdem wir von journalisten ber probleme bestimmte internetseiten zu ffnen informiert wurden haben wir sie unverz glich gegen ber dem organisationskomittee bocog angesprochen
92717 offensichtlich werden die probleme nun gekl rt uns war immer zugesagt worden dass journalisten ausreichende arbeitsbedingungen h tten ihrer arbeit nachzugehen der ioc vorstand wird sich bei seinen konferenzen ab samstag nicht speziell mit der angelegenheit befassen sondern allenfalls im rahmen der allgemeinen unterredung zum stand der vorbereitung
92718 das bedeutet dass die zensoren sehr bewusst ausgew hlt haben welche seiten sie ffnen um dem ausland gegen ber ein zeichen zu setzen
92719 mehr oder weniger klar ist sie zumindest ein schritt nach vorn ich hoffe dass die freigabe dieser informationseiten nicht nur f r die zeit der spiele gilt sondern auch danach anh lt und dass dann das internet v llig ge ffnet wird

92759 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
92760 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
92761 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
92762 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
92763 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
92764 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
92765 it was a victory for all who believe in checks and balances it certainly strengthens our hand
92766 the process of negotiation and accommodation that most often leads to resolution of disputes between the political branches
92767 if i could describe the new national defence strategy in one word it would be balance
92768 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u s
92769 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
92770 we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multidimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war
92771 we must display a mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat
92772 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
92773 i love the art of hip hop i dont always love the message of hip hop
92774 there are times where even with the artists i love you know theres a message that is not only sometimes degrading to women not only uses the n word a little too frequently but also something im really concerned about its always talking about material things
92775 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
92776 i hope that barack could pull the troops from iraq
92777 im feelin like a black republican naw i cant call it more like a black democrat runnin em out of office young barack obama im all for it
92778 theres a whole lotta room in the front of the range like barack obama said yeah its time for a change
92779 why is bush acting like he trying to get osama why dont we impeach him and elect obama
92780 its time for a change and that change is obama dear future president i hope you heard this letter and do some things to make sure the next one im writing is better
92781 america surprised us and let a black man guide us
92782 you ever think youd see a white rapper endorse a black president
92783 we much prefer to see the acquisition of an in market biologic franchise that the company is already familiar with as compared to a series of smaller riskier assets
92784 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
92785 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
92786 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
92787 theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and theyre going to send out nasty e mails
92788 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
92789 what were seeing out of the mccain campaign the republican party and some of their allies have been some very aggressive charges
92790 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
92791 from obamas repeated suggestion that hes running a racist campaign
92792 when he did it the first time yesterday we let it pass when he did it again later specifically linking us to it we decided to respond
92793 it is im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and we dont theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
92794 what we are talking about here is substance and not style
92795 campaigns are tough but i am proud of the campaign we have run im proud of the issues we have raised
92796 all theyre doing is churning out the same stuff they do every four years all you have to do is change the name
92797 so when you hear my opponent say hes too risky what theyre really saying is we know we dont have any good ideas but you should be worried about him
92798 it seems to me at this point it would be naive of the obama campaign not to anticipate efforts to tear at obamas character the way bush tore away at john kerrys character four years ago so if a fellow can rationally expect a swift boat full of funny racial angles racing at him he would only be sane to try to deflect that
92799 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
92800 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
92801 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
92802 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
92803 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
92804 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come
92805 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise taxes or support a tax increase
92806 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
92807 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
92808 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
92809 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
92810 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
92811 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
92812 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company

92855 ive just said to rick barker civil defence minister and others that well be doing a deep dive on these issues real quick and get to the bottom of what we need to do for the long term
92856 all of the mayors ive spoken to all of the civil defence staff have all said the systems were tested all worked well and nothing broke so i feel quite reassured by that
92857 its just about to be better to be at work i think than cleaning up
92858 cleaning up the vomit the blood and syringes and condoms and all the rest of it you get in hotels but also in casinos
92859 what were proposing is on every printed wage rate so every wage rate throughout the building is a four percent increase which we think is really competitive
92860 four percent is actually below the recent rises in the cost of living and certainly well below the increases in the actual costs to the staff
92861 the varroa mite worldwide has been devastating to the beekeeping industry its killed so many hives its certainly made it extremely difficult to continue and has increased our costs of production incredibly
92862 what weve got is a system where we can keep the spores of the fungus in there and it continues to kill varroa before the bees can take it out
92863 thats a trade secret of actually how it works in a couple of months when we get it commercialised then everyone will know but not just yet
92864 weve got organic beekeepers in the south island that dont have varroa yet so if we can get this on the market and get them to it early enough theyll be able to retain their organic status
92865 i see and i get enquiries every day for this product the world is wanting this pure product and thats our big point of difference

92981 our memory of what diablo and diablo 2 were was a bit different than the actuality of it visually we were remembering it as more of a dark colorless game but there was a lot of vibrance

93029 the position of the west as characterised by the use on the part of the united states britain and the european union of sanctions as a weapon of pressure or blackmail to ensure that an outcome which is according to their own definition prevails is of great concern to us
93030 we strongly urge these nations to withdraw sanctions and show goodwill in a practical way towards the sterling efforts being made through these talks to bring unity and progress to the people of zimbabwe
93031 we urge our political leadership and negotiators and the people of zimbabwe to stay focused on the prize and disregard these attitudes which are voices from our destructive past
93032 we therefore commend our political leaders president robert mugabe mr morgan tsvangirai and professor arthur mutambara and their parties for putting the interest of the nation first and courageously working together to defeat division mistrust violence and forging a viable and promising way forward for zimbabwe by consensus
93033 it is particularly inspiring to note that the negotiation process is a coming together of zimbabweans themselves we would like to assure the political leaders that this course they have taken is supported by the overwhelming majority of zimbabweans and must not be allowed to fail
93034 president mbeki has suffered completely unjustified irrelevant and unwarranted criticism from those who had this process been put into their hands this country would by now be in flames the voice of his critics is not the voice of african patriots but rather that of those who would sooner see african people under the tutelage of colonial masters
93035 the memorandum of understanding clearly sets the agenda of the talks and the negotiations will come up with a set of principles that will be ironed out in the future
93036 whatever administration to emerge out of the talks would be in a position to address the concerns of stakeholders and interest groups
93037 the signing by president mugabe and the opposition leaders of the mdc of a memorandum of understanding last week is an important step towards a genuine political solution to the current crisis in zimbabwe we sincerely hope that the ongoing negotiations between the zimbabwean parties will succeed
93038 the situation in the country is normal we have not received any reports of violence around the country and we have not paid much attention to the media reports
93039 i am fairly satisfied but there are like in any negotiations sticking points that need to be unravelled and therefore until we can get a full agreement which reflects the will of the people of zimbabwe i would say for the moment that is our struggle to ensure that it is achieved

93071 their goalkeeper had a wonderful night they threw bodies in the way of everything and made life very difficult for us
93072 but i was pleased with my lads they kept at them and if their goalkeeper had not had such a great night we would have won it at a canter
93073 but frankly we were never in any danger we should have won by a fair margin and we should have been quicker in possession but the key is that we have qualified for the next round that was the objective

93083 it is not a very well thought out idea this plan will see smaller firms struggling to survive attorneys are seen as the bad guys whereas we are providing a service to our clients
93084 whoever came up with this idea of cutting out the third party was not thinking straight it just doesnt make sense
93085 there have been cases of fraud brought before the raf but this is not the way to solve the matter if this decision is favoured by the courts we are set for a string of law firm closures this will lead to claimants taking pittances because they have no knowledge of how much their cases are worth
93086 up to now attorneys have acted for them on the basis that they pay from their own pockets substantial costs needed to mount the claims and to run the risk of the claims failing
93087 sums owing to claimants by way of compensation and costs are paid into the trust accounts of attorneys with powers of attorney signed by their client directing the raf to do so

93155 its been very successful and mars had proven itself to be very interesting mechanically the spacecraft is operating great and theres plenty of power margin to carry us beyond the waning summer
93156 with that what id like to do is announce that were going to extend the mission to go till the end of the fiscal year september 30
93157 were looking to understand the history of the ice by trying to figure out if this ice has ever melted and through melting has created a liquid environment that modifies soil
93158 were just getting the data back through this we also hope to resolve questions such as is this a habitable zone on mars
93159 meaning that we have periodic liquid water materials that are the basic ingredients for lifeforms

93176 i dont see either nation as a threat to the united states at this point but they both are investing in modernization programs that are of concern
93177 this approach tailors investment of substantial but not infinite resources in ways that favor key enduring us strategic advantages
93178 at the same time we will continue to improve and refine our capabilities to respond to china if necessary
93179 to bully its neighbors all of which are cause for concern
93180 all of these actions suggest a russia exploring renewed influence and seeking a greater international role
93181 will be defined by a global struggle against a violent extremist ideology that seeks to overturn the international state system
93182 mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat
93183 help shrink the ungoverned areas of the world and thereby deny extremists and other hostile parties sanctuary
93184 it is a truly sad time when we decommission a plane
93185 it is easier and cheaper to modify and maintain 76 planes than to keep all 94 up and running
93186 a choice was made between the air force and congress stating that at this point we need fewer operational b 52s
93187 the decision to pick the selected aircraft was based on a number of criteria that looked at the aircraft as a whole
93188 its not like the aircraft are all rusted and corroded its just that the selected 18 are not as airworthy as the first 76 the remaining planes are split equally between here and barksdale afb
93189 our job now is to make sure we keep the planes left here flying
93190 this recognition shows our strong relationship with the u s army and bae systems ongoing commitment to innovation
93191 we will continue to offer new products to our soldiers and marines ensuring that those who protect us are protected with the newest and latest technologies
93192 we are very excited because it appears the oral vaccine is even more effective than traditional injectable vaccine
93193 its expensive to create an injectible vaccine but with oral vaccines it is quite cheap you grow your plants and then you convert them into capsules
93194 ive seen the need there may be some very expensive treatments available
93195 but they are so expensive that developing countries cant access them i want to help change that
93196 getting these stovl aircraft into production quickly is critical to supporting the usmcs aviation recapitalization objectives
93197 the f 35 fighter production system now has all 19 sdd aircraft and the first two lrip 1 aircraft in flow we will continue to ramp up until we reach a peak rate of one f 35 per working day in the middle of the next decade
93198 the libyan leadership confirmed its interest in acquiring high quality products from the russian defence industry
93199 we reached agreement on concrete steps that will enable strengthening of the libyan armed forces thanks to bilateral cooperation
93200 we are working on the project of creating a nuclear power plant to be used for electricity generation
93201 a loss of confidence in his ability to command and his failure to meet mission requirements and readiness standards
93202 the current crisis is unlike any food emergency the world has faced in the past it is caused by a web of interconnected forces involving agriculture energy climate change and new market demands from emerging markets
93203 all this carries grave implications for economic growth and development international security and social progress in developing countries time is of the essence in formulating a response and u s leadership and bipartisanship are essential as well as expanded u s coordination with international organizations
93204 freedom is now under way our team is looking forward to this trials period to demonstrate all the capabilities our unique design for lcs will bring to the navy

93206 there are some excuses that all of us can use or abuse in order to say something about the peace process or the peace negotiations
93207 as an israeli i can use the situation in the gaza strip to say as long as hamas controls gaza strip there is no hope for peace

93254 sebab itu dia boleh berdebat dengan datuk seri anwar ibrahim baru baru ini tetapi kerja belum tentu bahkan tidak
93255 bagi saya shabery tidak patut berdebat dengan anwar baru baru ini inilah masalahnya apabila shabery tidak sedar anwar bukan calang calang orang untuk berdebat dengannya
93256 masa saya sekolah dulu kalau kita berdebat dan serang peribadi orang kita akan dipotong markah kenapa shabery buat perkara ini masa debat dengan anwar ini yang kecewakan ahli umno

93305 nach den guten ergebnissen zum ende der r ckrunde und der erfolgreichen vorbereitung hatte offensichtlich keiner der spieler daran gedacht dass man gegen paderborn verlieren kann und als dann das dritte gegentor fiel haben sie geschockt reagiert
93306 ich wei dass er das kann schlie lich hat er das gegen braunschweigs danneberg und erfurts br ckner gut gemacht doch ahmet ist auf dieser position verschenkt

93315 cara meluruskan shaf yang benar adalah menyejajarkan kedua tumit satu sama lain bukan menyejajarkan ujung jari jemarinya hal ini disebabkan karena badan bertumpu pada tumit sedangkan jari jemari itu panjangnya berbeda beda sesuai dengan panjang pendeknya telapak kaki ada telapak kaki yang panjang dan ada pula yang kecil karena itu tidak mungkin bisa mematok lurus secara tepat kecuali dengan kedua tumit adapun menempelkan tumit satu dengan yang lain maka sudah jelas dasarnya dari para sahabat yaitu bahwasanya mereka biasa meluruskan shaf shaf dengan menempelkan kedua tumit satu sama lain artinya setiap orang di antara mereka menempelkan tumitnya dengan tumit orang yang berada di sampingnya hal ini dimaksudkan agar mereka dapat mewujudkan perintah meluruskan shaf oleh karena itu apabila shaf shaf telah penuh dan para jamaah telah berdiri maka seyogyanya setiap orang menempelkan tumitnya dengan tumit temannya hanya agar dapat mewujudkan perintah meluruskan shaf saja hal ini tidak berarti ia harus menempel seperti ini terus menerus sehingga ia selalu menempel dengan temannya dalam semua shalat

93379 major cuts to greenhouse gas emissions could be achieved by the storage of carbon dioxide deep underground whilst supporting australias energy intensive industries and continuing the viability of access to cheaper power from fossil fuels
93380 as a major contributor to co2crc csiros expertise is being used to model potential storage sites as well as to predict the fate of injected carbon dioxide underground and assess the technical and environmental feasibility of the geological carbon dioxide storage
93381 western australia is likely to lead the application of commercial scale geological carbon dioxide storage over the next decade as a consequence of the growing liquid natural gas lng export industry
93382 our innovation is applicable to edge emitting as well as surface emitting semiconductor lasers operating at any wavelength all the way from visible to telecom ones and beyond
93383 it is an important first step towards beam engineering of lasers with unprecedented flexibility tailored for specific applications in the future we envision being able to achieve total control of the spatial emission pattern of semiconductor lasers such as a fully collimated beam small divergence beams in multiple directions and beams that can be steered over a wide angle
93384 such an advance could also lead to a wide range of applications at the shorter wavelengths used for optical communications a very narrow angular spread of the laser beam can greatly reduce the complexity and cost of optical systems by eliminating the need for the lenses to couple light into optical fibers and waveguides
93385 completing this first stage of the isfoc project marks a major milestone for solfocus and for concentrator photovoltaics in general on our way toward achieving grid parity for renewable energy
93386 working with the isfoc team in this collaborative project of commercial deployment and scale we are proud to deliver on the immense promise and potential that cpv holds in scaling to meet the worlds energy needs
93387 we chose solfocus cpv arrays as part of the isfoc project because we believed their non imaging optical design would provide efficient and reliable systems
93388 we had confidence that they would be able to meet not just the design challenges but the manufacturing challenges for volume deployment as well we could not be more pleased with the results
93389 we are proud of our simulation systems they are the standard of the industry we have invested heavily into the spectral quality and uniformity of the spi sun simulator only spire has the profound history of research built into production ready systems
93390 spires business in china continues to grow rapidly trina is a leader not only in china but in the world market and we are very excited to work with them on expanding their capability
93391 from our years of experience in the pv module industry we recognize the importance of having advanced equipment in our line to produce high quality pv modules to compete globally we have developed a beneficial relationship with spire and hope to continue using their high quality products to help us achieve our goals
93392 there are key concepts like interconnection standards net metering and others that national state and local officials need to understand in order to make the right decisions about solar for their communities we are simply bringing the knowledge to them as an industry so cities can deploy cost effective solar energy when and where it makes sense to them we commend our industry partners evergreen solar united solar ovonic sma america and xantrex for making this city tour a reality
93393 in the absence of action at the federal level local and state governments may begin to explore their options for oversight of nanotechnologies
93394 today there are more than 600 manufacturer identified consumer products available on the market that contain nanomaterials and countless other commercial and industrial applications the public and policymakers are not aware of
93395 our first generation 14 7 percent efficiency day4 mc module which has been in commercial production since 2006 already places us among the industrys highest performing multi crystalline products
93396 with the second generation of our proprietary solar cell designs we are taking a major step towards making solar energy cost competitive with conventional sources of electrical power generation
93397 i am truly proud of our research team a combination of high performance technology with low cost and manufacturing scalability represents a very significant achievement in reducing the kilowatt hour costs of solar electricity
93398 performance at this level using less costly multi crystalline material cannot be achieved without employing the day4 electrode technology
93399 nanotechnology research which is coordinated by the kurchatov institute and commercialization of nanotechnology projects for which rosnanotech is responsible
93400 we finance projects irrespective of who the bidders are and do not distinguish between russian and foreign companies i would like to draw your attention to the unique possibilities for developing and expanding business in russia

93434 the ioc coordination commission and bocog met last night thursday and agreed internet use will be just like in any olympics
93435 in the last few days its been obvious that there have been sites blocked on the internet
93436 i have received unqualified assurances from president of the ioc jacques rogge and the chairman of the coordination commission hein verbruggen that we have not shifted our position
93437 already we put a team together in the ioc to work with bocog to begin to open up sites which we believe are absolutely necessary to comply with non censored reporting of the games
93438 we are in the process of getting websites which were previously blocked unblocked
93439 there will be sites blocked that have to do with pornography or where in the opinion of the national government are sites which are subversive or against national interest and thats normal in most countries in the world

93446 weve been in the hobby of collecting autographs for over a decade
93447 however during the past few years weve found that the cost of getting collectable cards has risen and many fans are getting shut out of the fun the autograph cards that weve designed allow people the advantage of purchasing blank cards for specific sports at a reasonable cost
93448 we are expanding our product by offering a universal signature card
93449 we realize that there are other opportunities such as various mediums like television and movies it can be used for any type of celebrity autographs
93450 the first thing i noticed was her hair which was the color of margarine and fell into waves to the middle of her back it was the sort of hair you might find on a mermaid but completely wrong for a sixty year old woman who was not just heavy but fat and moved as if each step might be her last

93454 and so because a brilliant and devout old bishop augustine could not resist the controversialists temptation to take even a caricature of his views and defend it to the death rather than show dialectical weakness the whole doctrine of original sin in western christianity anyway got inextricably tangled with revulsion toward sexuality and images of tormented infants and there has never been a full and complete disentangling

93495 long term any plan that puts light rail out into snohomish county will help the area
93496 the city of mill creek is in favor of that in the short term it is imperative that we get more and better bus service to help relieve congestion sooner rather than later it is good to know thats their intent

93528 its like you have to improvise do what you can
93529 its a way to give back a little bit to the community
93530 we also had a great response from people who read about it in the newspaper
93531 they like to watch baseball today its been so awesome people from all over the state plus our own community came to watch

93541 son thou art ever with me and all i have is thine
93542 father i never knew it but it is true i am ever with thee and all thou hast is mine
93543 if you want to live to the glory of god seek one thing to claim to believe that the presence of jesus can be with you every moment of your life
93544 alas alas i fear i never can have the abiding presence of christ
93545 at any sacrifice i am going to have that taken out of me and i will give it up
93546 if i want to be entirely holy i know i shall have to be afflicted and i am afraid of affliction
93547 be of good cheer it is i be not afraid

93551 there is my lord manifesting himself in a new way there is my lord exercising a new and supernatural power and i can go to my lord he is able to make me walk where he walks
93552 like my lord i can triumph over all circumstances anything around me is nothing if i have jesus
93553 with gods presence you can have the presence and fellowship of christ all the day long your whole life through
93554 i have so much to think of sometimes for four or five hours of the day i have to go into the very thick of business and have some ten men standing around me each claiming my attention how can i how can i always have the presence of jesus
93555 my lord jesus nothing can satisfy me but thine abiding presence
93556 if christ calls me i can walk on the waves to him
93557 jesus i have heard thy promise that thy presence will go with me
93558 ah thats what will come of your higher life christians
93559 you never can life that life do not talk of it you must always be failing
93560 i have been trying to say lord i will live it but tell me suppose failure come what then
93561 in me there is nothing but i am going to trust my lord unboundedly

93579 the investment allows us to act on a global basis
93580 in china and india its a lot related to services and software
93581 its learning of it at almost the last minute that i think is destabilising the international media and certainly embarrassing for me as up till 48 hours ago i was insisting it would be free and uncensored internet access
93582 weve noticed that the words being used by bocog have changed in recent months from uncensored to what is more like convenient and timely or convenient and available these are quite different words
93583 nevertheless no one has come out publicly and said on behalf of bocog or the ioc sorry but there are certain internet websites which are blocked
93584 its having to find out and get the big surprise by an announcement by bocog at a press conference i think they could have done better
93585 this blatant media censorship adds one more broken promise that undermines the claim that the games would help improve human rights in china
93586 an evil fake religion that has been banned by the chinese government
93587 we went and nobody stopped us so we just shot
93588 lets wait for the wonderful performances when the games open on aug 8
93589 intel has demonstrated that the performance of their systems can help facebook scale our infrastructure
93590 intel is excited to engage with facebook as they are a dynamic force in the evolution of the internet
93591 big companies like boeing are very serious about going forward with as much commonization and standardization solution sets across as many products and programs as soon as they can
93592 they need to bite the bullet now with significant migration issues rather than continue to go forward with all the disparate systems for every airplane out there
93593 as the pressure increases on traditional media companies its a great opportunity for us
93594 we definitely have a very strong point of view of how to shore up your traditional business but also expand online weve shown success increasing page views and driving traffic
93595 a lot of them are doing the right things and were helping them along that path were helping them with the jump from old media to new media

93597 brought a different level of access that we didnt have before
93598 so far the only reason customers have noticed is because it became news
93599 while we are pleased that facetimes intellectual property rights are protected we are concerned about reuters timetable for installing replacement technology in light of its representations to the court as to its ability to provide adequate
93600 the trend is to access more and more applications in the cloud not call them locally
93601 thats forcing a lot of consumers who dont necessarily want to go with vista to reconsider their overall computing strategy
93602 they can switch to vista buy an apple machine or do something completely different
93603 we are not suggesting that it organizations stay away from blades blades do address many problems in the data center
93604 what we are saying is that it organizations adopting blades need to be prepared for further changes in this technology
93605 organizations must recognize that blade adoption needs to be a strategic vendor partnership decision and not a tactical purchase
93606 were putting that technology in place to enable us to do that
93607 everybody has a camera in their telephones when people can record an event taking place that helps us during an investigation its helpful
93608 i think that while its appropriate for the police department to invite video reports of wrong doing both by ordinary people and police officers the new york police department has a long way to go to ensure that police officers who engage in wrongdoing like what was captured in the two video tapes that were recently disclosed are held accountable

93612 we believe that new media tools redefine who the online newsmakers and reporters are
93613 this is part of the foundation upon which nowpublic is built traditional influence lists are increasingly irrelevant because theyre predicated on outdated factors and metrics
93614 people want ubiquitous cell service on their wireless phones everywhere they go and that includes their home and offices
93615 the airave makes it even easier to get enhanced coverage no matter where you live or work
93616 we have not announced that we are going to be selling an mp3 player
93617 we are looking into the possibility of coming up with different content avenues that can be shared across multiple devices built by dell
93618 that is something unique thats not fully offered in the marketplace right now
93619 we have completed restoring mail service including historical messages to all of the 1 of affected members thank you all for your extreme patience during this trying time
93620 by completing this restoration of mail services we hope we have put the vast majority of mobileme problems behind us and can now focus on improving other aspects of this new ambitious service
93621 it seems that while i can log in to mobileme and view my calendar contacts i continue to not be able to see mail as mail comes up as a completely blank page
93622 i believe both gentlemen genuinely wish that we will be able to work together to enhance value
93623 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
93624 in todays corporate governance system where large mutual funds control so much of the stock it is extremely difficult to oust an entire board no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
93625 realizing i could not gain control i saw no point in spending the final two weeks in a debilitating fight when little would be accomplished except to build animosity between both camps
93626 this is basically a way to run away from competition youre putting a lot of pressure on your less competitive peers
93627 nokia has always been extremely tactical with its pricing pinpointing sweet spots in different segments of the market and making adjustments to wrongfoot competitors
93628 theyve managed to minimize handset share losses even in the face of fairly aggressive competition particularly from the koreans in north america
93629 theyve managed to hang on to more market share than we expected and managed to do it without cutting prices too much
93630 it still has a mountain to climb its product portfolio is still not competitive enough and sustaining its position in the north american market in the second half of 2008 may prove challenging
93631 chinas semiconductor industry now is undergoing a transformation with an increased focus on designing chips for electronic products that are popular in the nation
93632 in the electronics industry china often is seen simply as a low cost manufacturing region
93633 however the rise of the semiconductor design business in china shows that the nations high tech future increasingly will reside in capitalizing on local brainpower to produce innovative products that appeal to the domestic audience
93634 this campaign has had extraordinary success in engaging children during the last year and the new ads along with the enhancements to the website will continue the momentum
93635 microsoft has an open intellectual property licensing policy but in situations such as this in which a reasonable licensing agreement cannot be reached despite our best efforts we have no choice but to pursue legal action to protect our innovations
93636 primaxs practice of using our innovations without taking a patent license is unfair to the many companies that have already licensed our technology so we are taking action to protect both our partners and our innovations
93637 since the start of the year vendors have been wary of the potential decrease in demand for mobile phones
93638 that has not stopped vendors from experimenting with and releasing a host of mid range and high end devices with gps touchscreen and multimedia this also goes for hotly contested emerging markets where vendors are introducing phones that offer features in addition to voice telephony
93639 the companys relentless focus on and ability to meet demand within emerging markets helped propel shipment volumes forward
93640 we want fios to succeed but were going to do what we have to do to protect our jobs and our healthcare
93641 we cant let corporate greed interfere with getting a fair contract
93642 the potential for very short term volatility around specific announcements in the process is predictable but we would be looking to buy verizon on dips rather than attempting to call each up and down tick over the month or so it may take to finally resolve the labor relationship for another period of years
93643 we have good visibility and a strong pipeline coming into the quarter
93644 theres an appetite for security and storage under one roof symantec is benefiting from that dynamic
93645 i think that provides a degree of insulation for us from broad macroeconomic slowdowns
93646 that said we are not immune perhaps a little better insulated than most

93652 with that resolution people can focus in on a small part of their city
93653 eventually people will be able to get up close and see the rocks beneath their house
93654 every time someone bores a hole in the ground and hauls out some rock we can refine our maps a little bit more
93655 rocks are not inert they influence the supply of water and the formation of soil and so impact flooding and agriculture
93656 geological surveys across the world are involved in trying to work out how you put co2 underground and keep it there and these sorts of databases are going to be required
93657 however some nations take the view that 1 1 000 000 is too commercially sensitive to release
93658 other parts of the world have not been mapped thoroughly enough to give us the resolution we would like
93659 you have to build qt copy adding the dbus linked option
93660 watching a financial crisis feels much like watching a natural disaster as long as you are watching from a safe distance
93661 a brilliant blow by blow account of how greed stupidity and recklessness brought the first major economic crises of the 21st century and the most serious since the great depression
93662 were just not seeing the retail sales wed like to see in elk grove
93663 if retailers are saying were slow in northern california or in miami and were going to hold back thats the start of the dominoes
93664 i want security there i dont want it to become a blight
93665 this has nothing to do with elk grove per se
93666 but we were looking to having the mall open for the convenience of shopping and the sales tax revenue
93667 it means that we will have to keep our belt tight and get through next year on existing sources of revenue
93668 our main concern is assuring that the highest caliber retailers are part of it the mall so when it opens is not as important as what it looks like when it opens
93669 its just a matter of timing its going to turn back around
93670 its not like in this downturn the place is going to hell in a handbasket thats not happening were a strong enough community that were going to get through this
93671 i think that whenever you have layoffs and you do that it will have an impact
93672 in the private sector we read every day stories where companies have to lay off that means there is less productivity there so we have to tighten our belt everyone has to tighten our belt
93673 they just told me ill have to wait for 40 minutes
93674 im concerned but im not sure whether theres anything we can do about it
93675 its too early to tell what the impact will be and were still measuring that potential impact
93676 there will definitely be impacts in the days going forward
93677 everybody hates to go to the department of motor vehicles and complains about the lines
93678 how long do you think the lines will be if workers were laid off and theyre not there
93679 leaves me with no easy choices only choices with consequences
93680 i have a responsibility to ensure that our state has enough money to pay its bills
93681 i want to apologize to all the state employees for having to do this
93682 state employees are working very hard but this is the only way out
93683 i have two children i need to take care of i just closed on a house and i can no longer make the first payment on sept 1 because i dont have a job
93684 the legislators depend on us even arnold depends on us to get things out on time
93685 im never going to change my culture yao has played with a lot of black players but i dont think hes ever played with a black player that really represents his culture as much as i represent my culture if you go back to the brawl thats a culture issue right there
93686 were waiting for assurances our veterans will receive high quality care
93687 our facilities are surveyed multiple times each year on average and less than one percent of these surveys result in deficiencies a testament to our diligent efforts
93688 providing our patients high quality care is our top priority
93689 its the only place in sacramento where you can come in here and not be judged you can be black or white fat or skinny
93690 its the only place where you can let your hair down
93691 its nice because guys dont hit on you and thats what i need since i have a serious boyfriend
93692 you see so many different styles and types of couples you see boy couples girl couples and heterosexual couples
93693 the coroners report doesnt say that police compressed mr abrahams to death
93694 who am i to say mr abrahams was not acting aggressively toward the officers
93695 they intentionally dog piled him it was this intentional conduct that resulted in his death
93696 all those facts support our position that the officers use of force was unwarranted
93697 im hopeful that city of woodland will take full responsibility for the officers conduct and resolve this case without causing the abrahams family to go through the pain of protracted litigation
93698 in his current condition the stoner exhibits an inability to communicate effectively
93699 in fact we have learned through our intensive research that both male and female stoners tend to lack the motivation to maintain proper hygiene
93700 the stoners fascinating courtship rituals highlight the extreme difficultly these animals have fitting into other social groups
93701 im a businessman im not here because i think youre nice people i think theres money to be made
93702 i also have this wonderful sense that were doing the right thing were going to employ thousands of iraqis but mostly everything here is for profit
93703 so theres danger everywhere i think the key thing is this will be tremendous for baghdad
93704 even the idea of bringing u s style escapism entertainment to the hell of baghdad is absurd
93705 just watch how much of this infrastructure even gets built
93706 instant overwhelming leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation
93707 im a businessman im not here because i think youre nice people i think theres money to be made
93708 i also have this wonderful sense that were doing the right thing were going to employ thousands of iraqis but mostly everything here is for profit
93709 so theres danger everywhere i think the key thing is this will be tremendous for baghdad
93710 even the idea of bringing u s style escapism entertainment to the hell of baghdad is absurd
93711 just watch how much of this infrastructure even gets built
93712 what depresses more than loss of money is loss of prestige loss of self esteem embarrassment and comparative failing in contrast with their peers
93713 they just want some medication for anxiety and then never show up again
93714 in his current condition the stoner exhibits an inability to communicate effectively
93715 in fact we have learned through our intensive research that both male and female stoners tend to lack the motivation to maintain proper hygiene
93716 the stoners fascinating courtship rituals highlight the extreme difficultly these animals have fitting into other social groups
93717 we want to give owner operators and fleet owners the right tools to safe practices on the road
93718 safety is a priority not only to freightliner trucks but to the entire transportation industry
93719 we are fortunate to have these multiple sibling generations interacting on exhibit
93720 in the past you could count on the end of the month being a heavy week
93721 now its the middle of the month its the beginning of the month
93722 there definitely is an increase in people coming to our services particularly new clients
93723 we feel if people are standing in line they deserve food
93724 the problems facing the eastern district of california result not from lack of effort but lack of judges and staff
93725 judges bear the burden of this heavy caseload but it is the citizens of the eastern district who must suffer the delayed administration of justice
93726 im being a good steward of the environment and making a product thats more saleable
93727 do i mandate changes that you cant afford we may be pricing people out of homeownership
93728 bridging the functional and territorial view of entrepreneurship and regional development
93729 sustainopreneurship business with a cause the promise of creative organizing for sustainability
93730 towards a deeper understanding of sustainopreneurship identifying core dimensions and aspects of sustainability innovations
93731 my mission is to communicate to wake up people up to give them my energy and accept theirs
93732 she hates the word musician im not a musician im a performer a writer an artist thats something i really wanted to show in the film because thats what i knew of her that she was all these things
93733 its a real true portrait of a very complex and somewhat elusive artist
93734 steven did a very good job of bringing out the many components of what makes patti unique and she is a unique artist
93735 shes a youthful attractive soft spoken girl i didnt take pictures until the end of the day but when i saw her perform at irving plaza in new york city this wasnt the same woman to me i was totally hooked
93736 i was just that friend who was behind the camera
93737 thats why the film is so personal because i wasnt going into it with a crew i was just trying to do something really cool and documenting somebody that inspired me
93738 steven did a great job of getting inside our band world and becoming our friend
93739 hes captured a certain informality that is often lacking in these more standard rock docs
93740 shes funny and can tell story thats what makes people sort of shocked
93741 its better for me for sure im having a great time doing
93742 it was probably the most fun ive ever had making a record
93743 the hard part was done the songs were written so it was just having our take on the songs having our way with the songs and having fun with it
93744 come with us cause were going on a different trip here and we want you to come with us
93745 were going to make the most indulgent thing i can f ing do
93746 christian will be there cool wait sunny is gonna be there ok im taking the day off work and seeing this show
93747 heh wow i thought i was this close to winning
93748 thanks you played extremely well too i think my teaching you how to play shougi has paid off
93749 i already knew how to play shougi before i became your roommate you know
93750 so is that why i kept embarrassingly beating you in the games we played while i was helping you move your stuff in
93751 do you want to play one more quick game of shougi then
93752 thanks but no thanks neji we already played three really good long games today it was great having the time to play with you though
93753 work and missions have just been so crazy and troublesome lately
93754 i cant even remember the date today all i know is that tsunade sama gave me a break today tomorrow and the day after that
93755 im sorry to sound like that but my mind is just so crammed with mission related things and more recently ways to finally beat you at shougi
93756 well its you know what im sure youll be able to remember soon
93757 okay what should we do now since you dont want to play shougi
93758 well i was thinking id bake a cake iruka sensei gave me the best sounding recipe the other day
93759 wait you actually went shopping youve never done that ever since i moved in
93760 shopping is troublesome and i figured i could just survive off of extra shinobi rations and anything i could mooch from your food stash while you were off on some mission
93761 uh yeah just stop stealing my food and buy your own from now on
93762 well if you dont want any of the cake i was going to make
93763 mayonnaise why would you need this to make a cake
93764 mayonnaise is made from egg yolks and would theoretically help keep the cake moist plus it was on the recipie so
93765 okay then why would you need a recipe to make a cake when youre planning on using already prepared cake mix
93766 frankly i dont feel like troubling myself in making a cake from scratch
93767 so since youre already here could you get me a large bowl the mixers and drag the trashcan over here shikamaru asked
93768 well the batter was starting to fly out of the bowl if i hadnt pulled out the cord we wouldve had one sticky mess on our hands
93769 its better if you learn how to do it here ill show you how
93770 okay thats good now set that dial only to medium speed at most good
93771 neji you have to move the mixer within the bowl
93772 its cooking spray itll help the batter from sticking to the pan as it cooks
93773 well a little bit longer than that ideally cakes should be let to cool for an hour after baking but i want us to be able to eat it by midnight so im only going to allot five minutes for it to cool
93774 youll see but since we have some time to kill im gonna take a deer nap
93775 shikamaru this is the nicest thing anyones done for me for as i can remember th thank you
93776 i shouldve gotten you one of those silly birthday hats maybe next year
93777 i think im going to go to bed good night shikamaru
93778 good night neji i hope the rest of your birthday is wonderful
93779 but moments later they along with their complementary eyelids constricted and lowered respectively to a normal position
93780 shikamaru grinned then got up and produced the bag with the mix which was from the store cocoa powder which hed gotten from his mother mayonnaise which hed gotten from ino frosting which hed stolen from a neighbour and eggs and vegetable which hed obtained from the refrigerator and cabinets
93781 then their gave departed as neji plugged in the mixer to the outlet as shikamaru stepped aside
93782 a pair of hands found themselves on the chin of one of the players
93783 ohh so is that why i kept embarrassingly beating you in the games we played while i was helping you move your stuff in
93784 neji no shikamaru exclaimed yanking the cord from its socket
93785 neji you have to move the mixer within the bowl shikamaru told him
93786 the fire started from s 10 coach of the gautami express at around 1 10 am local time 2040 gmt
93787 the passengers pulled the chain to stop the train immediately after the fire broke out and people started jumping out of the train
93788 troublesome because it can be read in several different ways
93789 sprint did not prove that its motivation and purpose was to estimate sprints damages
93790 the situation clearly demonstrates why renewable energy projects like this project need upfront capital to overcome challenges on their path to operation
93791 she was out of her mind almost just mentally emotionally and physically drained
93792 as the average climate warms up the heat extremes will become more extreme and well have more intense more frequent and longer lasting heat waves as we progress through the 21st century
93793 its sort of been the quiet killer for many years
93794 there were a number of days where the body count kept increasing and there was absolutely nothing you could do because the heat had already taken its toll it was a helpless feeling
93795 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
93796 if its too dangerous to touch it cant be clean
93797 so much worse could happen but it makes you feel like youve been invaded someone is taking liberties on your property that you would never take with anyone else
93798 if youre just driving around you might not notice it
93799 ill vote for obama because we need a democrat in the white house
93800 the best way that we can stand up for you is to make sure we have a democratic president taking the oath of office on jan 20 2009
93801 seen his passion his determination his grace and his grit
93802 there are a lot of folks still on the sidelines trying to make up their minds
93803 if were going to have a president that respects unions
93804 theres quite a few of us on the fence im not the only one a lot of her supporters are there
93805 right now obama is saying shes low on the list well decide what to do if he doesnt choose her
93806 i was thinking she would win and she slid back and i was really disappointed
93807 i definitely want to see a democrat in the white house
93808 he wasnt my first choice but thats the choice now
93809 she stood strong and tall and im glad shes supporting barack obama
93810 she has integrity and shes a lady of her word
93811 they have to focus on electing a democrat mccain is not union friendly
93812 if youre electing him youre putting bush back in the white house
93813 data source sqlexpress attachdbfilename datadirectory northwnd mdf integrated security true user instance true
93814 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
93815 that is perfect evidence that its ice salt cant do that
93816 weve done most of the things we need to do for a fully successful mission
93817 wed been trying to get an ice rich sample into tega without any success we decided to give up for a while
93818 we were aiming to get a dry sample from the trench and were very surprised to find ice mixed into it
93819 mars is giving us some surprises were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from
93820 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
93821 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
93822 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
93823 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public
93824 the progress in iraq has allowed us to continue our policy of return on success
93825 violence is down to its lowest level since the spring of 2004 and were now in our third consecutive month with reduced violence levels holding steady
93826 this shows our claims on emissions are simply a big lie
93827 the government has known about this for a very long time but has just refused to face up to it
93828 there is no way the government can hope to achieve any of its emissions targets without cheating unless it changes its policies on encouraging flying and hoping to satisfy peoples insatiable demands for buying more and more stuff
93829 it cant be absolutely precise but it is a best estimate of where we are it is very much in line with other studies on the subject so we are fairly confident of it it is very interesting background information
93830 would not want to be held to an international target on it
93831 holding china and india responsible for emissions from manufactured goods they sell to us is going to prove very hard to negotiate
93832 it would be much easier to base any future deal on emissions at the point of consumption that feeds into the equity debate in which poor countries will be allowed to increase their co2
93833 its at the very least misleading for the uk government to claim reductions while we export our emissions this is a problem no government wants to face
93834 in emissions terms we are constantly battling against increases of wealth every year we dont even manage to improve our energy efficiency to keep up with wealth increases let alone to cut emissions
93835 theres a very fundamental problem here that no one really wants to talk about
93836 its not your normal thing to go cruising around doing especially for a guy like me
93837 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
93838 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
93839 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
93840 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
93841 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
93842 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
93843 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
93844 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible

93850 among the myriad utilities that help you edit file information and permissions filexaminer has always stood out
93851 i am very impressed with its user friendliness excellent piece of software
93852 many thanks for filexaminer this tool helps me out 20 times a day not many osx tools you can say that about
93853 filexaminer is a useful tool i keep coming back to it does more and costs less
93854 much better than bare bones super get info and 10 less
93855 this is a much better product than super get info from bare bones and its cheaper
93856 it includes much of the functionality of xray and filexaminer along with an array of more
93857 i spoke to many doctors and they all said it just takes time for inflammation to get out
93858 now obviously im a little bit scared because mri shows nothing but i still have pain they say its going go away but its there for already 10 days so im going to try and see the doctor now and try to get it out
93859 i was planning to go straight to beijing but now i might go back to europe to see the doctor
93860 i spoke to many doctors and they all said it just takes time for inflammation to get out
93861 now obviously im a little bit scared because mri shows nothing but i still have pain they say its going go away but its there for already 10 days so im going to try and see the doctor now and try to get it out
93862 i was planning to go straight to beijing but now i might go back to europe to see the doctor
93863 der sachverst ndige ist zu dem schluss gekommen dass ein schicksalhaftes geschehen vorliegt es ist zu komplikationen gekommen die leider nicht zu verhindern waren
93864 no patients that we have been able to identify have died as a result of a misdiagnosis
93865 however a number of patients are undergoing treatment and we cannot definitively say they will not be affected later on it would be misleading the public to say so
93866 the one bit of good news out of this whole thing is that although it should not have happened in the first place the problem was identified and we need to make absolutely sure this cannot happen again
93867 its vital that robust systems are put in place at hereford county hospital to stop this happening again
93868 its also important to remember that incidences like this are very rare
93869 the basic pattern is clear this is becoming a w shaped recession
93870 will go back to declining after people finish spending their checks
93871 while we expect domestic demand to remain weak going forward stabilizing inventories will likely provide some positive offset in the second half of the year
93872 whatever strength there was came from the tax rebates from exports and from strong federal government spending
93873 these steps came out of the core value of being a responsible company
93874 things have changed here so rapidly that a lot of people havent gotten to know each other yet
93875 we still have good access to debt capital particularly doing the types of deals we do
93876 theres a big pool of talent in the region and thats a big deal
93877 one of the keys in this situation is that we move toward passive funds the returns for actively managed funds typically arent good enough to justify the costs
93878 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
93879 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
93880 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
93881 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
93882 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
93883 its important that we focus on stabilizing the financial system
93884 a very substantial change in the balance between growth and inflation
93885 you have to do the backstop because once you get to that point your particular choices are very limited
93886 ive just been on the phone to my father who is with her at the moment and she is okay shes fine shell be out of hospital in an hour
93887 i havent been up on a horse for over a year
93888 its an unfortunate incident and we wish pippa a full and speedy recovery from her injuries
93889 but we are talking about a horse perhaps after being photographed for 15 minutes or so it just got spooked
93890 the horses would have been specifically selected from the as their temperament would have been deemed suitable for a photoshoot
93891 but unfortunately when you are dealing with animals of this nature there is some element of risk

93909 we believe that our christian faith is a continuous perpetuation of a major miracle the new birth it is a vital and unique work of god in human nature it is not reasoning yourself into a position but something happening that cannot be explained for what happens to a christian can never be explained by a psychologist in that great and terrible day there will be those white with shock when they find that they depended on a mental assent to christianity instead of on a miracle of new birth

93948 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
93949 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
93950 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil

93957 during the next few years the vast array of lakes and seas on titans north pole mapped with cassinis radar instrument will emerge from polar darkness into sunlight giving the infrared instrument rich opportunities to watch for seasonal changes of titans lakes

94073 white matter tracts are bundles of axons that form connections between different parts of the brain
94074 highly interconnected deep gray matter structures such as the basal ganglia and the thalamus act as relay stations to integrate incoming sensory and motor input before it passes to the cortex they also play a role in relaying cortical output both white matter tracts and deep gray matter structures are essential to the rapid communication and integration of information within the brain
94075 abnormalities can vary from complete to more subtle malformations but overall brain white matter volume is reduced in fasd especially in the temporal and parietal lobes
94076 deep gray matter structures are also known to be smaller in individuals with fasd and have decreased metabolic rates and abnormal metabolite ratios compared to those in children without fasd
94077 dti is an advanced mri technique that uses the properties of water diffusion within the brain to obtain information about fine brain structure
94078 if cell membranes and other tissue structures are degraded or malformed for some reason then the water runs into less obstructions and the water travels further in the tissue which can be measured with dti tractography uses dti data to virtually reconstruct white matter pathways through the brain allowing for visualization and analysis of specific white matter tracts that are critical for various cognitive functions previous dti did not use tractography to delineate individual white matter tracts and none looked at deep gray matter structures
94079 we found widespread diffusion abnormalities in the brains of children with fasd
94080 we showed diffusion differences in the corpus callosum which is in agreement with previous studies but we also showed changes in many other white and deep gray matter structures that have not been previously reported the white matter connections that seemed to be particularly affected were the corpus callosum and tracts connecting to the temporal lobe our study supports the notion that widespread abnormalities exist in the brain due to alcohol exposure while the child is in the womb
94081 our results suggest that damage caused by prenatal alcohol exposure is very widespread and affects many regions of the brain
94082 furthermore the differences between children with fasd and controls were present across our age range from five to 13 years of age finally our findings on volume reductions and differences in the corpus callosum confirm previously reported differences thereby supporting prior research on brain abnormalities amongst fasd populations
94083 for example imagine a ball tossed into the air that suddenly disappears or someone successfully predicting what you will do next
94084 these tricks may seem like they defy the laws of physics and logic but they are actually created through a combination of skill and a deep knowledge of human psychology
94085 by drawing upon the practical knowledge and experience of magicians scientists may obtain new insights into various areas of human perception and cognition that we are still struggling to understand
94086 magic is one of the oldest art forms in the world and relies on peoples ignorance of its methods although the methods we have developed are proving very useful in investigating the mind in our dual roles as scientists and magicians we take great care in protecting the mysteries and secrets of magic
94087 the effects discovered by scientists over the past few years are clearly related to the effects that magicians can produce we are now at the point where we can begin to create a science of magic that will let us understand how magic effects work and suggest how we might further develop them and apply them in everyday life
94088 the results of the study provide the first evidence of automatic imitation in birds this helps us towards a better understanding of learning processes that have broad implications in both a human and an animal context
94089 so parents and teachers need to revise their thoughts about this
94090 because if your mom or your teacher thinks you cant do math that can have a big impact on your math self concept
94091 boys did a teeny bit better in some states and girls did a teeny bit better in others
94092 but when you average them all you essentially get no difference
94093 but we need to motivate teachers to do so by including those items on the tests
94094 so youre dipping farther down into the distribution of female talent which brings down the average score
94095 that may be the explanation for the results rather than girls arent as good as math
94096 but as a scientist i have to challenge them with data

94102 estamos en el proceso de desbloquear las web que previamente hab an sido bloqueadas

94109 this study provides direct evidence that governmental action to eliminate polluting coal burning sources benefits childrens neurodevelopment
94110 these findings have major implications for environmental health and energy policy as they demonstrate that reduction in dependence on coal for energy can have a measurable positive impact on childrens development and health in china and elsewhere
94111 this is a unique environmental intervention study using molecular techniques to demonstrate the relationship between a cleaner environment and healthier children

94116 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date
94117 structural separation isnt a necessity but is ideal if you want to be sure there is equal opportunity for all players
94118 scepticism around the validity and value of separation are understandable but at the end of the day it forces the incumbent to have a more considerate view of the wholesale market
94119 regulation emerges from what would otherwise be a free market system because stakeholders with political power are able to entice politicians into imposing regulations that shift wealth from the less powerful to the more powerful
94120 there are other ways to spur competition other than separation
94121 all markets are different and its naive to think you can apply a generic model to every country
94122 structural separation must be viewed from a case by case basis
94123 every incumbents situation has its own idiosyncrasies and comparing other countries attempts at this is mainly a futile discussion
94124 ideally this should have happened prior to the government selling telstra but that wasnt in the best interests of the government at the time
94125 the decision took into account the chief researchers past dismissal from seoul national university for manipulating research papers in 2005 and ethical questions in procuring human eggs and his indictment for illegally trading in human eggs
94126 we expected our request to be accepted because the research plan we submitted has no flaw in terms of legal and administrative procedures
94127 our immigration and resettlement policy is not effectively encouraging people to make long term commitments

94139 este es un caso viejo que karadzic comenz en 1996
94140 un trato as hab a sido inmoral y falto de tica
94141 el embajador holbrooke y nosotros hemos dejado claro repetidas veces que no se ha hecho ning n acuerdo por el que radovan karadzic pudiese haber tenido inmunidad para ser juzgado o arrestado
94142 y para explicar esto a su propia gente desvel la historia entonces y la ha adornado durante doce a os pero hay cero verdad en ello
94143 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
94144 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
94145 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
94146 not only did we play the race card we dealt it from the bottom of the deck
94147 im never happy about money going to charter schools i dont think voters are going to like it either this is essentially going to hit homeowners who are about to lose their homes people are hurting i think theyre going to look for any excuse to vote it down
94148 i trust the people of los angeles our existing building program has produced 1 8 billion dollars in tax revenue and 247 000 jobs i believe people of the la understand that although children are the beneficiary were an economic engine and we impact lives with jobs and with taxes so yes itll pass and yes im happy
94149 that means if the board wanted to they could vote to take the buildings away
94150 with that money we could build or renovate 30 schools
94151 lamentablemente en vista de esta decisi n de la federaci n internacional estas atletas no podr n participar en las olimpiadas de pek n
94152 en estos momentos hay dos posturas diferentes y creo que m s que en manos de los directores deportivos est en manos de los presidentes que son los que deben encontrar una soluci n
94153 el valencia es historia para m como presidente y como accionista me he desvinculado totalmente del club y mi gente est saliendo tambi n soriano va a tener libertad absoluta para tomar sus decisiones
94154 ha sido un orgullo estar en el valencia y lo que he hecho lo he hecho con el coraz n
94155 no voy a conceder entrevistas tras salir del valencia hay que tener el m ximo respeto al club porque lo importante es la instituci n y no las personas
94156 estar en el valencia ha supuesto un m ster acelerado en muchas cosas y estoy satisfecho de estos cuatro a os en los que he conocido a mucha gente y he hecho muchos amigos
94157 un pasito por delante del resto pero los dem s andamos m s o menos a la par
94158 estamos trabajando cada d a cuando venga el primer partido trataremos de ganar porque el primer choque es siempre el m s complicado
94159 la intensidad defensiva es el punto principal para comenzar y hoy la hemos conseguido tanto en la primera como en la segunda mitad
94160 en el primer tiempo defendimos bien aunque no pudimos desarrollar nuestros sistemas pero en la segunda mitad creo que conseguimos mejorar con m s dinamismo y m s pases
94161 el mejor partido jugado por el combinado argentino durante los 40 minutos
94162 defendimos duro y nos vamos con otra cara sentimos que dimos un pasito m s hacia adelante con m s movilidad de pelota mejor juego y m s defensa
94163 todav a no estoy satisfecho hemos tenido problemas en la defensa del uno contra uno durante la primera mitad no pudimos pararlos y eso es lo que carg de faltas a fabricio oberto y luis scola

94171 el objetivo es el mismo aqu que en el resto de circuitos este a o quedar cerca del sexto y como equipo sumar puntos en la ltima carrera sumamos ocho los de nelsinho piquet y eso nos ha dado mucha confianza no cambian mucho las cosas pero nos hace estar m s cerca de nuestro objetivo
94172 para el monoplaza de la temporada que viene en jerez probamos algo del a o que viene pero la principal prioridad es el coche de esta temporada
94173 que nuestro objetivo es quedar a partir de la sexta posici n y ves que no puedes hacer nada esto no es lo que ha sucedido en los ltimos a os cuando marcaba poles y sub a al podio pero esto es parte del juego no siempre ganan los mismos ni el tour o en el mundial
94174 no recuerdo ni una carrera en la que heikki kovalainen haya ido con menos gasolina que lewis hamilton vimos en hockenheim c mo kovalainen se apart para que pasase hamilton a m me tocar a estar haciendo el papel ese ahora prefiero hacer quinto o sexto con renault que hacer cuarto o quinto con mclaren

94205 wir gehen davon aus dass auch 2009 ein sehr anspruchsvolles jahr mit gro en herausforderungen sein wird
94206 es de agradecer el esfuerzo realizado por parte de los clubes la liga los futbolistas y la afe adem s del csd ya que sin su aportaci n hubiera sido impensable realizar todas las adaptaciones normativas
94207 reconducir el camino para mejorar el f tbol profesional espa ol
94208 es una de las mejores del mundo por lo que han merecido la pena todas las reuniones mantenidas durante este tiempo
94209 se trata de un nuevo modelo de relaci n entre clubes y jugadores un modelo que apuesta por un modelo social del f tbol que va a permitir una mayor protecci n a los deportistas y que va a dar mayor seguridad a los clubes
94210 si hay alguien que quiere utilizar esta ley como un subterfugio vamos a intentar por todos los medios que no sea as

94244 we discussed a number of topics not related to football including bretts long term relationship with the packers i consider our conversation to be confidential and am going to be respectful of brett and his family and keep the details private
94245 ted and mike mccarthy and i are going to continue to work on the football side of this issue they have my full support
94246 when youre doing negotiations theres ups and downs i cant speak for marks feelings
94247 theres nothing that says he has to be there at a certain time
94248 except for the fact that once hes reinstated the packers are practicing
94249 will they cut him will they trade him i dont know
94250 thats why he started working out but right now it looks like hell be the quarterback at oak grove high school
94251 he wants to give both the packers and brett an appropriate amount of time to make decisions including decisions impacting the teams roster and salary cap
94252 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
94253 this is something that needs a lot of time to heal which really hurts me to say that i have to miss the olympics
94254 im currently packing up really quick to hop on the plane and head to new york for a second opinion but i wanted to let all of you know first that theres no chance of me competing in beijing the timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything

94257 but the fragments cannot demonstrate the full picture of the spectacular opening ceremony
94258 nobody stopped us when we entered the main stadium on monday chinese officials let us in after we showed our id cards and we shot the rehearsal
94259 the purpose of the broadcast was aimed at heightening enthusiasm toward the beijing olympics by showing south korean viewers the magnificence of the opening ceremony there was no other intention
94260 we were very lucky tonight for us to have a shutout
94261 it might be the first time ive heard of a pitching staff throwing a shutout with 186 pitches thats 20 an inning thats way too much obviously the key was chris scholl giving us a good middle in there because buddy boshers reached his pitch count after four
94262 it surprised me i didnt know they were going to have players comments when my sons came up that got to me that surprised me
94263 its been a taxing last 48 hours a lot of emotional stuff but its part of the game
94264 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
94265 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
94266 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
94267 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
94268 that was a 1 2 tandem that was one of the best in the game
94269 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
94270 that is a factor and will always be a factor for me
94271 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
94272 we let it be known with the dodgers that was the one ballclub he had interest in going to that any deal we were going to do was going to be the best baseball deal we could do and it wasnt going to be a financial deal to try to move dollars we just werent happy with the prospect we would be getting back and we chose to hold onto him
94273 i know what i want to say i just have a hard time saying it
94274 although the state previously recommended community service instead of jail it now wishes the court to reconsider the sentence and impose jail not because the defendant has failed to comply with the order but because according to dr roby she will eventually fail to comply
94275 there is no evidence that the defendant has to date failed in any obligation imposed by this court
94276 its an honor to be connected with an industry whose roots extend back to the beginnings of the country and whose basic mission is simply to tell the truth
94277 im proud of the role the herald has played over a century and a half in helping people be good citizens as well an entertaining readers with our occasional grammatical mistakes
94278 its much more community oriented now than it once was
94279 im of the old school my generation depended on the newspaper and they still do
94280 youth just dont get their news from newspapers like my generation did
94281 but because of new requirements with the standards were making more yellow and red day calls
94282 the real important point here is not how many red or yellow days but that our air is still not healthy
94283 ideally there should be no days that i shouldnt allow my kids to go outside
94284 in the olden days they would fill up a storage tank at a gas station and all those gasses would escape into the atmosphere
94285 a group demographically made up of a lot of mothers
94286 why would they return the peyote chief and not the other 15 000
94287 there was nothing in the agreement about us giving them back we believe it was illegal for him to have them theyre contraband and were not going to give them back
94288 permitting indians non drug use of peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies of a native american church but prohibiting such use by non indians would violate free exercise and equal protection clauses
94289 in interpreting the reach of the federal religious peyote exemption as incorporated into utah law we rely on its plain language electing not to defer to a contrary interpretation that the state argues has been adopted by the federal dea on its face the exemption applies to members of the native american church without regard to tribal membership the bona fide religious use of peyote cannot serve as the basis for prosecuting members of the native american church under state law

94303 we in the global south believed the primates meeting had the authority to discipline the episcopal church the 1988 lambeth conference urged the primates meeting to exercise an enhanced responsibility in offering guidance on doctrinal moral and pastoral matters and the 1998 lambeth conference reaffirmed this so it was appropriate after the american decision in 2003 that the archbishop of canterbury convened an emergency meeting of the primates to address the biblical and ecclesiastical crisis into which the americans had plunged the anglican communion the primates including the american primate unanimously advised that the consecration should not proceed nonetheless two weeks later the primate in america presided at the consecration as bishop of a man living in a same sex relationship this was a deep betrayal since that meeting there have been numerous other betrayals to the extent that it is now hard to believe that the leadership in the american church means what it says they say that they are not authorising blessings of same sex unions yet we read newspaper reports of them two american bishops have even presided at such services of blessings bishops have written diocesan policies on the blessings of same sex unions it is simply untrue to say they have not been authorised that such blessings continue and seem to be increasing hardly demonstrates regret let alone repentance on the part of the american church so when the archbishop of canterbury invited these american bishops to participate in the lambeth conference against the recommendations of the windsor report and the primates meeting and in the face of the unrelenting commitment of the american church to bless sinful behaviour we were stunned further betrayal

94556 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
94557 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier with trying to make the club better at this point in time than to do this we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
94558 we expect him to be here tomorrow and most likely play
94559 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
94560 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs
94561 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
94562 i think hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
94563 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
94564 mannys certainly not a simple personality thats for sure hes complex but ive seen him when he competes
94565 hes one of the greatest hitters ever to play the game its going to be a battle between us starting tonight
94566 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them

94588 the compactrio embedded system and labview graphical tools from national instruments gave us the power to design prototype and deploy the control system within our visica2 medical device quickly and beat our time to market goals while saving money by eliminating the need for building custom hardware the rio architecture and new low cost hardware help us even further by allowing us to quickly move to lower cost hardware when deploying our machines at high volume without having to redesign software or start over from scratch with a new design
94589 we were able to rapidly prototype our system for fedex using labview and compactrio and create a final deployed solution with ni single board rio all in under a year the fact that ni provides hardware and software to quickly prototype and deploy embedded systems was crucial for us were quite sure we wouldnt have been able to hit our aggressive deadlines without ni tools

94591 so much of the focus on this issue has been in africa but there the interface between humans and other primates is decreasing the intensity of bush meat hunting and infectious diseases have taken a huge toll on primate populations there individuals in africa who are interacting with other primates are often very isolated from other humans they live in small rural villages which limits the potential spread of pathogens
94592 some macaque species thrive in human altered environments given the tolerance of the local people
94593 this is a heterogeneous sample subjects reported contact with primates in a variety of contexts it seems that some of these contexts are going to be very important but they haven t been studied much zoo workers and bush meat hunters have been typically considered at the highest risk for viral transmission but none of the zoo workers or hunters in our sample tested positive for sfv

94608 there was understandable disappointment among harry potter fans when only one copy of the tales of beedle the bard was offered to the public last december
94609 i am therefore delighted to announce that thanks to the generous support of bloomsbury scholastic and amazon and with the blessing of all the wonderful people who own the other six original books the tales of beedle the bard will now be widely available to all harry potter fans
94610 notes by professor albus dumbledore which appear by generous permission of the hogwarts headmasters archive
94611 dumbledores commentary on the tales which was discovered among his papers after his death includes some historical notes personal reminiscences and insights into that most mysterious branch of magic wandlore
94612 i very much hope that readers coming to these classic wizarding fables for the first time will find his commentary both entertaining and helpful
94613 to benefit institutionalized children in desperate need of a voice
94614 but i mean i like everybodys verse because i think that lupe killed it kanye killed it mine was more about style than how dope the rhyme was it was really my melody that i liked more than anything thats why my vocal approach was a little different from what you would hear me do i wanted to just do something different that would look different on me
94615 the concept is based on old 80s video game graphics playing behind us while were rhyming
94616 we just want to have fun with the project in a day and age where the record industry is what it is im lucky enough to be on a label that understands and theyll just let us have fun

94620 being able to put all my love of chinese culture into a fantasy like the mummy and the wildness of it that was a challenge i couldnt turn down
94621 weve taken the premise of relocating the oconnells from egypt and putting them in china which is as we all know another archaeologically rich nation a long time ago rob was a harvard major in archeology with a special interest in chinese studies so this was a passion piece for him
94622 we have an idea of what he does how he does it
94623 getting to help defeat jet li that was kind of fun jet li is someone that is a power and entity
94624 i really wanted to say hey i helped beat jet li up
94625 they would have to sew me in in that first fight every time i flipped my pantyhose were always down around my ankles
94626 get out and vote or the end will be near
94627 the world is ready for change because obama is here
94628 any chair unless hes paralyzed yeah i said it cause bush is mentally handicapped
94629 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
94630 i heard about his skills when he was doing his thing in chicago i definitely heard some rumors that he was going to run but i just wanted to feel his vibe man hes real down to earth his energy is great hes just an honest dude and hes all about change im all for change im just pro obama i dont think theres anybody better who can be put in that office right now besides that man
94631 i think at the end of the day it was one of those situations that caught me off guard
94632 i didnt realize i was working so hard to actually capture his attention that really showed me thats the day i realized i made it
94633 the concept is to bring all the people together as one person linking as one world at the state of where the world is now with all these wars and conflict all over the place i think a record like that is needed thats the best time when a voice needs to be heard i felt like what better voice between me and mike to be able to say something like that at the time we in outside of trying to do a club record or a record we expect to get thousand of spins it was more so lets do a record that fits all formats but also has some meaning to it but of course for the future well be finishing up the rest of the record
94634 were gonna set up a whole tour around it its a big play
94635 she was mad cool down to earth yet conservative polite she felt like a high school friend she felt mad approachable cool as hell we had a great time working the chemistry was right on point the record shows it because we came up with a smash
94636 i realize i been foolish i never should have turned my back
94637 cause its a cold world when youre out there all alone so many times i wanted to pick up the phone and tell you ooh baby baby i miss your loving so
94638 do you think we can pick up where we left off before the day that i told you it was over packed my things and moved away
94639 she really aint actually we switched some words around so people dont think she was singing about bobby this record is more of a record that anyone going through that situation would be able to relate to its just the fact that she got out of a situation is what made it more relevant im doing two records for her album
94640 on december 1st of 1981 where were emmett and rosalie that night at dinner
94641 i went and got a fake id with a different name and i have a pair of sunglasses and a hat
94642 the game is incredibly accurate its identical and its so intuitive for me as a player that i have become better at my instrument its gotten me a hotter girlfriend its made me better looking and ive made more money since playing it
94643 that or you pick out of a hat which is not fun we can run faster than dashboard confessional so if it comes down to a foot race it should be us
94644 were working stuff out with his management and were talking about splitting the cost of a ping pong table to take out
94645 i wish we could take credit for the number of deaths
94646 the writers damian shannon and mark swift after we had done everything said did you notice how many kills there were and we said yeah there are a lot they said actually there are 13 so the writers had figured that out
94647 we also show what jasons doing when hes not killing
94648 hes just great on it and people didnt know that its fun to watch
94649 our character has been rejected hes pulled away from society he wants to live by himself and all of a sudden these kids come into his area and disrespect his area and he has nowhere to go hes like a caged animal with his back against the wall and he albeit in a bad way protects himself
94650 my knees got pretty damaged i had some bad knee problems afterwards and it took me about four weeks to really recover from it it definitely isnt as campy as the original friday the 13th movies they were what they were for their day but when you look at them now you dont get as creeped out its a different feel i think the audiences are demanding a little bit more of horror movies now so ours is a lot of blood and guts and weapons and stuff like that
94651 ive been doing the character background the victimization of jason since he was abused as a child he was always the outcast
94652 he was always shunned by society so ive taken the stance that its almost like a vietnam flashback where someone has been victimized and abused so badly that when things resurface and these kids start to encroach on his area he is once again having a flashback its a moment so intense that hes getting his revenge for when he saw his mother get murdered hes still in the moment like these people just recently murdered his mother and hes having his revenge
94653 we had to keep the hockey mask which is where it all started and camp crystal lake as a jumping off point for us to go back to the first one
94654 we wanted to make a movie that was fun and we havent done that before
94655 a lot of our movies i think have been more dreary and tended more towards what they call torture porn the scares are so scary but the scares are happening to kids that you love because you had a fun experience with them these are kids who are drinking smoking and having sex and its been a long time since youve seen that on the big screen were hoping that those two things coming together will give the audience a new experience with a horror movie
94656 oh you must be having a terrible time its smoky in here
94657 but i dont really smoke mom i was just sort of i dont know desperate to put his face on that canvas but i cant get it right

94666 i will have to go to the gym to get rid of my mamma mia middle
94667 just for personal reasons and you know because its miley and theyre gonna do good were gonna do good too the audience is gonna vote so well see
94668 were not gonna see it until its live so i have no idea
94669 yeah i was surprised it got so big that we had to do it somewhere like this
94670 the tension is building up and people are getting nervous were gonna smoke the audience
94671 what do you expect i mean were real people i have nothing bad to say about anybody
94672 its too early to say how long that will last
94673 we have always rightly or wrongly thought that being that far away an attack was relatively unlikely after what has happened we will think through how we can better protect our facilities with the government and specialists
94674 shell is making substantial targeted investments to grow the company for shareholders and help to ensure that energy markets remain well supplied spending is increasing on new acreage and selective acquisitions as we refresh the portfolio with new options for future growth
94675 these results are much lower than expected and put a lot of pressure on the companys management to do something
94676 they will either have to make an acquisition or to boost their share buyback program
94677 this is another set of competitive earnings for shell shareholders good operating performance combined with increased oil and gas prices offset the impact of weaker downstream conditions in the second quarter
94678 we are making very large profits i know that but we are making very large investments
94679 if you notice since britney spears started wearing clothes and behaving paris hilton is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
94680 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest we can deal with
94681 i forget the exact terminology but the comment was made in terms of her activities now seem to be that shes calmed down and shes in a relationship thats quieted her down and as such she seems to be attracting less attention and theres less activity that the paparazzi all of you are focusing on
94682 thats definitely been the rumor and its been coming from their camp so i really cant conform that at all i positively cannot confirm that i hear that its his birthday that weekend so he might be in town but these guys youre never going to know anything until the last minute anyway thats what ive been told ive heard those same rumors and that would be really cool right but there are definitely no guarantees youll just have to settle on listening to great music
94683 tom morello man i tell you what tom morello is the real deal and you will not be disappointed
94684 well you start walking the grounds and they start loading everything in and you see sort of how your blueprints working out
94685 youve got everything from the stages to the sound and lights to your backstages your artist area your vip area your cabana area and then you get floods of friends and guests that want to come and where are you going to accommodate them and you get new areas youre putting in you always have sound issues because you have so many stages so you have to position each stage and the speakers so they dont affect that other area
94686 weve got a ton of trees in grant park and were really maximizing those trees this year
94687 aside from the music the other thing were creating here is a scene
94688 its the most important aspect of lollapalooza aside from the music and the musicians themselves it goes right to the audience and whos there people want to bop around and meet people and maybe hook up so were always looking to create social situations and social stimulations within the grounds
94689 as far as our single day ticket counts radiohead seem to have taken this year
94690 radiohead sold out first and their production is just incredible
94691 we also have nine inch nails and trent reznors production is one of the best in the world
94692 i can tell you that on the inside hes ramping up if you thought nine inch was great before and the production was great before theyre stepping it up that much more now and when jack white came in with the raconteurs the first time lots of people said it was the best act weve had i am assuming these guys have developed and evolved together so thats going to be a great rock show
94693 this year i couldnt ask for a better lineup but its going to be quite something to top 2008 we are the biggest festival in the country overflowing with 75 000 people a day so i think this year were done weve done it but next year were already speaking and planning and guess what next year looks fantastic it really is unbelievable

95029 it would be a mistake to think that the moldovans belarusians ukrainians or russians are not europeans only because they live outside the european union

95039 the interest in our historical and spiritual past and present the interest in the meaning of life is back after being lost for the last century

95041 soviet atheistic policy once implemented in our countries echoes in various attempts to prevent the influence of faith on society and restrict it only to divine services and social care for disadvantaged citizens
95042 developing aggressive secularism in western european countries as its spirit is similar to the soviet course in religious field
95043 public sphere often promotes unattractive or even intentionally perverted image of christianity some believers in west seriously speak of christianophobia they even made a website to record such incidents
95044 it hurts us in eastern europe where we build new churches to hear that christian churches in the west are sold or let for commercial purposes some european cities consider a possibility to transfer christian churches to other religious communities

95051 i just dont see how anyone can talk about business in relation to the art that they created id need a representative or something i dont think the artist can even think about business or a scene related to it or whats going to come of the art after its created that sort of shit interferes with the creative process
95052 these people are being called writers just for mocking shit
95053 not too bad same old shit architects graphics words hows your band

95058 no you had a demo copy before anyone else knew about it because your friend worked at capitol records or whatever right i think you even burned me a copy of it i remember feeling so awesome because of that because the band blew up like six months later but i had a copy of their demo when they were unknown it was like i knew a secret no one else knew or something
95059 yeah well their first album that one youre talking about isnt all that bad i guess but i cant imagine ever actually liking them theyre so safe and boring

95070 you know nicholas a lot of us wondered why you never showed up to the awards ceremony at graduation i mean you were one of the best painters that school had ever seen and easily the best in our class why didnt you show up
95071 i just um yeah it just isnt for me that award stuff i dont see how anyone can get an award for something like art which is supposed to be judged by opinion its not like you can statistically calculate who deserves an award for being the best at anything artistic its just ridiculous to even consider it so i just decided to forget that it ever happened to forget that it was judged at all
95072 i heard this about you too youve turned into a true nihilist
95073 no on the contrary i wait who told you that
95074 who hasnt so are you one of those people now who thinks that nothing happens in this world without some sort of ulterior motive
95075 and then you harbor this resentment for people who make something out of themselves because you see them as corrupt youre one of those people who thinks nothing happens naturally and that everything is connected you dont think theres truth anywhere in the world do you
95076 but nick thats life people have ulterior motives when theyre so much as looking in the mirror even dolphins make faces when you put a mirror in front of them part of being a human is having motives to begin with youre staring at a fucking black hole dude you gotta show your work

95168 if your exs best friend pursued you he has revealed that he is not a man of good character since he obviously doesnt know what it means to be a best friend
95169 sometimes people will gravitate toward exes or friends of exes because theres something familiar there and theres the fear of moving on
95170 i could have saved myself a lot of trouble and heartache

95174 for a while i couldnt imagine anything taking away this sense of peace i had found i ignored the little things that ticked me off he never stood up to me he had a habit of starting each sentence with the same disclaimer he went to the wrong college i ignored it because he seemed like prince charming
95175 i remain sure that he is indeed for someone else

95194 this new album marks such a dramatic shift for kid confucius and so its important that the first single completely embodies that difference this song should really grab people shake them around and smack them in the face theres no time to ease people into what weve become
95195 the only reference i can come up with is kings of leon meets otis redding but thats not even the half of it this new direction is the result of boiling kid confucius down to its core and at the core we are a rock band that plays soul music we learnt this important truth about ourselves while touring extensively last year and we look forward to touring again this august because the new songs and new sound are custom made for being bashed out on stage

95217 this investigation is in response to concerns raised by a small number of staff
95218 we have identified around 25 people and they are a myriad of different cancer types
95219 so 25 is not a big number over 2 000 and weve had a diversity of different cancers
95220 we really felt that if staff are concerned about it the only way to address those concerns was to retain some consultants and conduct a proper and thorough investigation so we can give them a high level of comfort that there isnt a problem
95221 i dont believe there really is a cluster here at all but we need to take it seriously
95222 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved

95227 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues
95228 i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world
95229 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report

95233 tim macartney snape deceives schools who invite him to talk to students about climbing mt everest by exploiting the occasion to promote jeremy griffith and his teachings
95234 abuses his position of influence derived from his reputation as a mountaineer to recruit students at schools for jeremy smith
95235 it is unsurprising that the impact upon his career as a speaker was dramatic and immediate
95236 the national broadcaster conspired with a religious fundamentalist to do a complete hatchet job on a groundbreaking scientific idea

95242 there isnt a perfect solution to this but packers president mark murphy is at least trying
95243 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
95244 but im not going to base it all on just my job either its something that i dont want to go through again personally
95245 im just sorry that something like this had to happen to me especially again
95246 because i really look at myself as being a person that has high integrity and high character and ive worked a lot of years to get to that
95247 to have these types of errors in judgment is something thats not part of my character its something im deeply sorry about
95248 they pride themselves on running this organization with high character and high integrity and i did something that tarnished that
95249 thats something i dont feel great about but im going to do everything in my power to try and change that part of a tarnished image for me right now
95250 just because i dont want to take my family through it or myself this is kind of an embarrassing thing for me
95251 and theyre going to get opportunities and well see so far it has been looking great
95252 this offense as long as i can remember has been real heavy throwing to the backs
95253 i dont know how much confidence matt had doing those things in years past

95288 it is all a risk how do i know if this new idea is worth funding
95289 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
95290 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free
95291 wow ha this is really unique and in my expert opinion it would only serve to enhance and bring more business to us at name of search engine withheld for legal amp confidentiality reasons and not cause us to lose business in the slightest amazing
95292 buckling down and pressing my secret to its fullest potential
95293 well see just how long i can make it available before it saturates things
95294 hes already so amazingly rich that whether he continues or discontinues its sale will neither make nor break the man but not grabbing it for yourself while its still available could prove disastrous for you as you may only have one chance and a very limited one at that to get this

95306 with the mersey hospital well be able to get as close as we can to an effective elective surgery hospital in the state
95307 because they wont be able to deal with the high complex emergency patients who often take over the theatres and mean that elective surgery gets cancelled
95308 today i have been able to announce that the north west regional hospital at burnie will be receiving a 19 per cent increase in their budget which also means they will not have any carry forward debt over this next financial year
95309 how do i come up with high paying elite keywords that will attract traffic to my website that havent already been snatched up by other online marketers

95327 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 percent on the same period last year
95328 greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
95329 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
95330 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
95331 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years
95332 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
95333 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardising the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
95334 im never going to change my culture yao has played with a lot of black players but i dont think hes ever played with a black player that really represents his culture as much as i represent my culture if you go back to the brawl thats a culture issue right there
95335 if artest didnt want to be here they had to find a way to get rid of him
95336 we know how talented he is and the rockets gave up a lot for him hes a great player and he can do a lot for houston but you dont know what youre going to get out of him
95337 im going to push these guys just like theyll push me
95338 i want to pass the torch onto the younger guys i want to teach these young guys how to play the game how to get the most out of themselves how to approach game situations and how to practice how to work hard
95339 my four kids and wife have friends here my cousin and my church is here i already know kings basketball president geoff petrie and the team owners maloofs and what they expect out of me
95340 every time i step on that court im going to still play the same way that i played when i was here they wont get anything less than that from me
95341 my thing is not to come in and look at it like im furthering my career
95342 im probably going to play two years beyond next season depending on how my body feels but just probably at the minimum ive made my money i just want to be around get two more years in then learn the coaching aspect of it and try to be a coach after two years
95343 marca un hito en nuestro pa s por los criterios tan severos que se siguieron para su aprobaci n
95344 this shows our claims on emissions are simply a big lie
95345 the government has known about this for a very long time but has just refused to face up to it
95346 there is no way the government can hope to achieve any of its emissions targets without cheating unless it changes its policies on encouraging flying and hoping to satisfy peoples insatiable demands for buying more and more stuff
95347 it cant be absolutely precise but it is a best estimate of where we are it is very much in line with other studies on the subject so we are fairly confident of it it is very interesting background information
95348 would not want to be held to an international target on it
95349 holding china and india responsible for emissions from manufactured goods they sell to us is going to prove very hard to negotiate
95350 it would be much easier to base any future deal on emissions at the point of consumption that feeds into the equity debate in which poor countries will be allowed to increase their co2
95351 its at the very least misleading for the uk government to claim reductions while we export our emissions this is a problem no government wants to face
95352 in emissions terms we are constantly battling against increases of wealth every year we dont even manage to improve our energy efficiency to keep up with wealth increases let alone to cut emissions
95353 theres a very fundamental problem here that no one really wants to talk about
95354 nachdem wir von journalisten ber probleme bestimmte internetseiten zu ffnen informiert wurden haben wir sie unverz glich gegen ber dem organisationskomittee bocog angesprochen
95355 offensichtlich werden die probleme nun gekl rt uns war immer zugesagt worden dass journalisten ausreichende arbeitsbedingungen h tten ihrer arbeit nachzugehen der ioc vorstand wird sich bei seinen konferenzen ab samstag nicht speziell mit der angelegenheit befassen sondern allenfalls im rahmen der allgemeinen unterredung zum stand der vorbereitung
95356 das bedeutet dass die zensoren sehr bewusst ausgew hlt haben welche seiten sie ffnen um dem ausland gegen ber ein zeichen zu setzen
95357 mehr oder weniger klar ist sie zumindest ein schritt nach vorn ich hoffe dass die freigabe dieser informationseiten nicht nur f r die zeit der spiele gilt sondern auch danach anh lt und dass dann das internet v llig ge ffnet wird
95358 sie bef rchten offenbar dass ich wenn ich in die stadt fahre kontakt zu ausl ndischen politikern aufnehmen will die zur er ffnung der spiele kommen

95363 fueron consideradas durante mucho tiempo como individuos a los que s lo les preocupaba comer reproducirse y protegerse de los avatares del clima y de los grandes depredadores
95364 sin embargo descubrimos que hace 12 000 a os destinaban a los beb s un lugar privilegiado respecto a los adultos
95365 no podemos descartar la idea de que esos hombres prehist ricos fueron a buscar las piedras a la llanura a unos 15 kil metros de distancia para utilizarlas en las sepulturas de los beb s y recordar su ubicaci n
95366 los beb s fueron enterrados como si estuviesen sentados o inclinados y las piedras fueron colocadas aposta sobre sus cuerpos ese ritual hace pensar que los beb s ten an un especial valor en esa comunidad
95367 descubrimos que a veces desplazaban las sepulturas m s viejas de adultos con sus huesos pero nunca las de los beb s
95368 no hay huellas de violencia que sugieran que los beb s fueron sacrificados pienso que murieron por causa natural y fueron llorados y enterrados de la misma forma que los miembros m s ancianos de la comunidad
95369 nuestros descubrimientos nos permitir n comprender mejor el ritual de la inhumaci n y llevar a cabo estudios sobre la salud infantil el crecimiento y la alimentaci n de los reci n nacidos
95370 people are supporting antonio villaraigosa because hes a person who as mayor is out there and willing to take some risks
95371 hes willing to take on some of the challenges that have sat dormant for a long long time
95372 i think its more of a question of when not if
95373 the question is is this the right time or some time down the road
95374 its frustrating because the career politicians can raise that much in 15 minutes at one of their cocktail fundraisers
95375 the issue that brought him a lot of trouble is essentially personal
95376 i have a responsibility to make sure that our state has enough money to pay its bills
95377 it is a terrible situation to be in i dont think any governor wants to be in this situation but this is really the only way out at this point
95378 the state of california the elected leadership cannot put the important public servants of california in harms way
95379 we put people first we make sure we protect their interests and thats why i have to tell the governor with all due respect i am not going to comply with this order
95380 people are going to get put out of their homes
95381 the governor says hes sorry we cant pay with sorry
95382 we believe budget reform is an essential element and we also appreciate there may be some tax loopholes that need to be closed
95383 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
95384 im disappointed that obama would say the things hes saying
95385 is that the best you can do is that what this election is really all about is that worthy of the american people
95386 the most negative abhorrent nasty vicious comment made in this race was the insinuation by barack obama that john mccain was going to run a racist campaign
95387 the mccain campaign will not stand for it there is no evidence of it its not true and we will rebut it
95388 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
95389 but he does believe theyre using the same low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in the campaign
95390 he learned a lot in south carolina in 2000 apparently not all of it good
95391 what they did to mccain in 2000 is what mccains trying to do to barack obama in 2008
95392 the injection of this issue into this race was done by the obama campaign we responded to it
95393 but recently especially last week with obama in europe it seemed like there were a lot of campaign ads you put out that were doing that
95394 and the one yesterday comparing him to paris hilton and britney i was like ok it seems to americans like me you may have flip flopped

95455 actually i didnt really know what to expect i never played here before today was my first round other than the two practice rounds i played
95456 pretty tough golf course really so i tried to play as conservative as i possibly could if i could get the ball in the fairway try to put it somewhere in the middle of the green and try and two putt from there thats pretty much what i did all day
95457 i have been working on a few things i took some time off after buick and came back here and just been working on a few things trying to get myself a little bit more consistent
95458 so not overly confident starting the week just because youre playing the first round with some reasonably major changes not huge but enough to make you feel uncomfortable but it worked out pretty well
95459 well i played british open qualifier there i think it was last year in my mind i thought it was the toughest golf course i had ever played and still believe that

95467 nature never intended the infants stomach to be converted into a receptacle for laxatives carminatives antacids stimulants and astringents and when these become necessary we may rest assured that there is something faulty in our management however perfect it may seem to ourselves
95468 to feed an infant with animal food before it has teeth proper for masticating it shows a total disregard to the plain indications of nature in withholding such teeth till the system requires their assistance to masticate solid food and the method of grating and pounding meat as a substitute for chewing may be well suited to the toothless octogenarian whose stomach is capable of digesting it but the stomach of a young child is not adapted to the digestion of such food and will be disordered by it it cannot reasonably be maintained that a childs mouth without teeth and that of an adult furnished with the teeth of carnivorous and graminivorous animals are designed by the creator for the same sort of food if the mastication of solid food whether animal or vegetable and a due admixture of saliva be necessary for digestion then solid food cannot be proper when there is no power of mastication if it is swallowed in large masses it cannot be masticated at all and will have but a small chance of being digested and in an undigested state it will prove injurious to the stomach and to the other organs concerned in digestion by forming unnatural compounds the practice of giving solid food to a toothless child is not less absurd than to expect corn to be ground where there is no apparatus for grinding it that which would be considered as an evidence of idiotism or insanity in the last instance is defended and practised in the former if on the other hand to obviate this evil the solid matter whether animal or vegetable be previously broken into small masses the infant will instantly swallow it but it will be unmixed with saliva yet in every days observation it will be seen that children are so fed in their most tender age and it is not wonderful that present evils are by this means produced and the foundation laid for future disease

95658 the material thats on the new album is exactly what we needed to put on it
95659 your chance to make that record learn from legends prove your parents wrong
95660 the material thats on the new album is exactly what we needed to put on it
95661 your chance to make that record learn from legends prove your parents wrong
95662 the material thats on the new album is exactly what we needed to put on it
95663 yeah and thats because when we started touring we learned what goes over well and what doesnt
95664 people love these kind of groove riffs but weve actually been increasing our speed some of the stuff on the new album is quite fast and weve kept the interludes real short and the songs are pretty short too i think these songs are all really catchy they are to me anyway i think its just a case of better songwriting
95665 but the material thats on the new album is exactly what we needed to put on it i didnt want to put anything else on it i have to admit i just felt it was enough all of our albums i think theyre between 42 44 minutes long and this one is around 39 minutes but as weve gotten better as players the tempo of the songs has gotten a lot faster which shortens the songs laughs back on our second album we played a lot slower and our songs were nornally over four minutes long
95666 the material thats on the new album is exactly what we needed to put on it
95667 your chance to make that record learn from legends prove your parents wrong
95668 i turned around and the guy sitting right behind me was standing up and stabbing another guy with a big rambo knife right in the throat repeatedly
95669 i said give me a hand and lets get this guy and the other guy took off
95670 some people were puking some people were crying some people were shocked
95671 he just looked at us and dropped the head on the ground totally calm

95673 when there is a lack of affordable housing for people to move into and when shelters are turning them away and they have no place to go it is unconstitutional to ticket them for sleeping outside
95674 it took me over 10 years to find the perfect site for this project because i was looking to create a recreational property that was more than just a place to vacation
95675 i wanted to build the type of development which gets passed down from generation to generation is sustainable stands the test of time and provides the best four season recreation in the province
95676 this is the place i see my family owning as a legacy property
95677 the legacy offers buyers a quality built home thats quieter more energy efficient and longer lasting than wood framed homes
95678 the location has 400 feet of beach front and five star resort amenities including pools and fitness centre and a private marina
95679 with so many fractional and limited use developments on the market i really wanted to offer people the chance to own a quality home that they can pass on to their family perhaps retire in and use year round without restrictions the kind of place that families return to year after year
95680 we know shelters are running at maximum capacity every night they are turning away dozens of people every day
95681 when there is a lack of affordable housing for people to move into and when shelters are turning them away and they have no place to go it is unconstitutional to ticket them for sleeping outside
95682 the charter of rights and freedoms protects peoples right to life liberty and security of the person we say ticketing people for sleeping outside when they have no other realistic alternative is a violation to their right of security of the person
95683 i have not received any tickets and so i cannot comment on it
95684 if drug dealers are moving in we want to find a way to keep them out its unsafe for the residents
95685 right now we are not enforcing the bylaw about erecting any structures or tents but if we see criminal code offences we may deal with them depending on the circumstances
95686 everybody we spoke to knew about the festival and were open to helping us out
95687 they were willing to share the space they will move out and let us use the park for the day
95688 instead of a two hour journey we had a nine hour journey
95689 its nice and scenic but by five hours we were exhausted it wasnt the best start to a honeymoon
95690 weve been talking to whistler tourism and we think that a lot of people will come so long as they know it is on
95691 the festival is 51 years old we were here before the highway was so we know people will come
95692 the failure occurred deep enough in the slope that i dont think a bolting program would have prevented it it was just too big
95693 it means the province can start collecting at least some of the more than 6 million that was advanced to mr malik for his legal costs
95694 mr malik had signed an agreement to repay the funds that were advanced to him it is regrettable the province had to commence a foreclosure action in order to realize those funds
95695 the event is far more family friendly than in previous years
95696 we will have some increased aspect of inspection and if deemed necessary will do more work in certain areas we identify as potentially unstable we will do some more scaling more drilling some more blasting some more remedial rock work put in some more bolts some more mesh
95697 theres been nothing to suggest in any recent surveys any imminent issues or imminent problems that would have required immediate work theres no red flag so to speak
95698 is there a contingency plan what is it when are they going to reveal it why have they not told us yet what that plan is
95699 i can absolutely assure you the contingency plans include how to deal with issues like rock slides how to move the public and the visitors in the event theres any interruption like that
95700 i do run from the bedroom to the laundry room
95701 everybody said i should live here in the new house for a little while
95702 even my doctor told me to put my feet in the salt ocean water he thinks its good for my legs
95703 i dont want to make too much dirt you know i try to keep everything nice and neat
95704 thats what i said at the beginning and im still homesick
95705 the biggest problem is a lot of times is they dont think of it as their house for a while
95706 it takes a lot of time for them to fit into that mentality that they can do whatever they want with it
95707 i think the pne home is so iconic that people do plan on living in it and i would certainly say in recent years the concept of the sunshine coast actually enhances that
95708 you dream of it but its also a great tradition your grandparents bought tickets your parents bought tickets and now you buy tickets
95709 some of the first homes in east vancouver were pne prize homes
95710 but i think people dont live here any more they sold their places i think most people sell them
95711 we loved the house but it was more of a showpiece
95712 it wasnt really a house to have kids in it was all brass and glass and mirrors
95713 i will go back to the old one in mission and get that one fixed up and sell that one and then get something probably in abbotsford that is smaller and will suit us a bit more
95714 they are not built to have structured time they are just exploring their world
95715 you cant force them to sit down and learn the alphabet
95716 i think people visualize little ones in desks definitely not
95717 if we instituted a universally accessible high quality daycare program with well paid daycare workers that would be a better option than expanding our school based academic system for children who are 3 and 4
95718 i would ask a child to try something and they would say no i would ask why and they would say because im stupid it just breaks your heart
95719 you have children come to school who are reading and some who cant hold a pencil
95720 brain research has shown that during the early years childrens brains have the most plasticity this evidence suggests that during this time there are windows of opportunity when children are especially receptive to experiences that can shape their whole lives
95721 the economic benefits of quality programming in the early years have also been studied showing significant savings in social programs when children participate in them

95725 ncp didnt make a ton of money but it was a moneymaking company it was very seldom that the plant was ever in the red
95726 people are still sticking in prince george and trying to find work here there are some that have found jobs elsewhere but even those by and large the familys here and they just work out of town
95727 when we looked at rebuilding the outlook for a plywood plant was that there was going to be a challenge on fibre in prince george in the medium to long term
95728 also in terms of the markets for plywood we felt those were going to be very challenging in the future as well
95729 the combination of those two things made the economics of a plywood plant not very good
95730 i can see their story the markets terrible we cant sell what were producing weve got a wood basket thats shrinking thats going to cost us a lot of grief down the road we could use the cash for other things that are badly needed so unfortunately were going to take this route
95731 north central plywood has a very strong history in the prince george area i sold logs to north central plywood over a number of years so they were always a great company to deal with and its disappointing not to see ongoing operations there
95732 weve got a number of programs in place to support the employees i know canfor is doing their best to place those employees into jobs in their organization but its a very challenging time
95733 i thought that canfor would continue to be committed to our community and rebuild the plant but it didnt turn out that way
95734 the real difficulty with the forestry industry is that a lot of these people arent old enough to retire and they might only have a skill set that is transferable to another mill

95736 in de winter moeten wij andere dingen ondernemen anders redden we het financieel niet ik verkoop dan gl hwein en oliebollen
95737 dat zou de doodsteek voor de kermis geweest zijn want je kunt niet alles doorberekenen naar de klant
95738 veiligheidsvoorschriften milieuzoneheffingen keuringen van de voertuigen en aanhangwagens noem maar op en dan hebben wij ook te maken met de sterk gestegen brandstofprijzen in de winter kost het onderhoud veel geld de revisie van de motor en de vertragingskasten van mijn attractie kostte dit jaar 18 000 euro
95739 maar het systeem daar werkt prijsopdrijvend de hoogste bieder mag er staan daarom moest ik 3 50 euro als ritprijs vragen dat vind ik eigenlijk te veel als gezinnetje ben je dan gauw klaar
95740 hier gaat het op inschrijving zonder dat exploitanten van elkaar weten wat hun pachtsom is in eindhoven kijken ze niet alleen naar het geld maar ook naar de kwaliteit van de attractie en het bedrijf daarachter
95741 the only people who become great managers are the ones who understand in their guts that managing is not merely a series of mechanical tasks but a set of human interactions
95742 now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation
95743 the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your ancestors
95744 beloved is man for he was created in gods image and the fact that god made it known that man was created in his image is indicative of an even greater love
95745 praised are you lord our god king of the universe who has chosen us out of all the nations and bestowed upon us his torah
95746 who has chosen us out of all the nations by bestowing upon us his torah
95747 for you have chosen us and sanctified us out of all the nations and have given us the sabbath as an inheritance in love and flavour praised are you lord who hallows the sabbath
95748 come gather together draw nigh you remnants of the nations no foreknowledge had they who carry their wooden images and pray to a god who cannot give success
95749 let the waters teem with swarms of creatures that have a living soul
95750 the verse creatures that have a living soul pertains to the jews for they are the sons of god and from god come their holy souls and the souls of the other nations from where do they come rabbi lazar says that they have souls from the impure left side and therefore they are all impure defiling anyone who comes near them
95751 israel merited that god called them men as it is written but you my flock the flock of my pasture you are men if any man of you brings an offering why are they called men for it is written and you who cling to the lord your god this means you and not the other nations and because of this you are men you are called men
95752 it would seem that the more extreme and exclusive interpretations of the doctrine of election among jewish thinkers were partly the result of reaction to oppression by the non jewish world
95753 yes i do believe that the chosen people concept as affirmed by judaism in its holy writ its prayers and its millennial tradition
95754 the chosenness of israel relates exclusively to its spiritual vocation embodied in the torah the doctrine indeed was announced at sinai whenever it is mentioned in our liturgy such as the blessing immediately preceding the schema it is always related to torah or mitzvoth
95755 you alone have i singled out of all the families of the earth that is why i will call you to account for your iniquities
95756 throughout the ages it has been israels mission to witness to the divine in the face of every form of paganism and materialism we regard it as our historic task to cooperate with all men in the establishment of the kingdom of god of universal brotherhood justice truth and peace on earth this is our messianic goal
95757 we affirm that the jewish people are bound to god by an eternal covenant as reflected in our varied understandings of creation revelation and redemption we are israel a people aspiring to holiness singled out through our ancient covenant and our unique history among the nations to be witnesses to gods presence we are linked by that covenant and that history to all jews in every age and place
95758 praised are you lord our god ruler of the universe who has chosen us from among all peoples by giving us the torah
95759 praised are you lord our god ruler of the universe
95760 implies the superiority of the elect community and the rejection of others
95761 the idea of israel as gods chosen people is a key concept in rabbinic judaism yet it is particularly problematic for many jews today in that it seems to fly in the face of monotheistic belief that all humanity is created in the divine image and hence all humanity is equally loved and valued by god i find it difficult to conceive of a feminist judaism that would incorporate it in its teaching the valuing of one people over and above others is all to analogous to the privileging of one sex over another

95765 people feel bad about economic issues they are concerned that the political bickering in this country is not helping to generate solutions
95766 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
95767 no court civilian or military has credibility when it listens to secret evidence in a closed courtroom
95768 is not ideal since it deprives the public of being able to make up its own mind about guilt or innocence
95769 it is to be expected given the nature of the proceedings
95770 its everybodys desire for the trials to be as open as possible
95771 it is my hope that the american public will someday hear mr hamdans defense
95772 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
95773 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
95774 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
95775 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
95776 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
95777 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
95778 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
95779 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
95780 if we leave and it increases at least our hands will be clean from that point on
95781 it means that some 98 000 pages of evidence which the state confiscated in raids on mr zumas homes and also those of his legal adviser at the time two of his legal advisers can be used as evidence against him in the corruption trial which is scheduled to get underway next week
95782 it flows out of the conviction in 2005 of his former financial adviser schabir sheik and it revolves around money that was said to have been solicited by zuma in order that he would intervene on behalf of a company bidding for parts of south africas arms deal
95783 on these particular matters yes but he will next week seek to have the entire case thrown out of court when his trial is due to begin in kwazulu natal province in pietermartizburg there are also other applications pending one in mauritius another in the united kingdom where he is seeking to have the release of documents to the national prosecuting authority blocked

95799 we believe that new media tools redefine who the online newsmakers and reporters are this is part of the foundation upon which nowpublic is built traditional influence lists are increasingly irrelevant because theyre predicated on outdated factors and metrics did we steal a play from an old media pr conceit lists yes do we want more traffic of course but today there are almost innumerable ways for ones voice to be heard the goal of the mostpublic index is to measure on a completely transparent metric driven basis who is most effectively broadcasting their own personal brand online and who are the emerging players

95847 we hope that iran will choose cooperation instead of increasing isolation and will give us in the following days a response that the international community is waiting for
95848 you are all seriously the best support team of all time i love you all so much
95849 but in reading this thread i do not encourage any of you to send in photos of yourselves in support of me
95850 it will prompt people to write even more articles implying that i have
95851 that is the last thing i want you intention behind it is so sweet and thank you for all have the courage to want to go to the extremes for me
95852 but imm urging you to not go ahead with the project
95853 your support means so much to me so thank you for that x x
95854 there has been a lot of controversy over jess and her private pictures so to show some support to jess the members have decided to create this project
95855 remember lets make it funny if youre doing a video clip go all out watch the chris crocker leave britney alone video if you havent
95856 you can either write the words on you or take the picture and edit to add text
95857 there is currently no time limit for this project but the sooner you send in the picture video clip the better
95858 i think were all just sick of the girls getting all this bad publicity just because theyre famous
95859 i think this is a brilliant idea and hopefully it will get jess to laugh or at least smile then it will all be worth it
95860 may it turn out to be a wonderful thing fingers crossed
95861 i love this it feels good to do something to help jess out
95862 lets just say were expressing our love and support for jess through the art of photography its art

95869 whats your problem are you on your period or something
95870 no im not on my period and dont you ever accuse me of being on my period ever again asshole
95871 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
95872 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
95873 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
95874 theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and theyre going to send out nasty e mails
95875 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
95876 what were seeing out of the mccain campaign the republican party and some of their allies have been some very aggressive charges
95877 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
95878 from obamas repeated suggestion that hes running a racist campaign
95879 when he did it the first time yesterday we let it pass when he did it again later specifically linking us to it we decided to respond
95880 it is im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and we dont theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
95881 what we are talking about here is substance and not style
95882 campaigns are tough but i am proud of the campaign we have run im proud of the issues we have raised
95883 all theyre doing is churning out the same stuff they do every four years all you have to do is change the name
95884 so when you hear my opponent say hes too risky what theyre really saying is we know we dont have any good ideas but you should be worried about him
95885 it seems to me at this point it would be naive of the obama campaign not to anticipate efforts to tear at obamas character the way bush tore away at john kerrys character four years ago so if a fellow can rationally expect a swift boat full of funny racial angles racing at him he would only be sane to try to deflect that
95886 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honour the commitments made to the international community
95887 the ioc coordination commission and bocog met last night and agreed
95888 i dont think that politicising the olympic games will do anything good to addressing any of the issues
95889 it is only inevitable for people from different countries and regions may not see eye to eye with one another on some different issues
95890 and i think in this context we should enter into consultations on an equal footing to narrow our differences and expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect
95891 the ioc and the chinese government i think are the ones to be held accountable here i think the blame related for anything related to the politicisation of the olympics really falls on their shoulders
95892 the ioc is not true to its word has never been true to its word and the leadership of jacques rogge has seriously and forever damaged the olympic movement and all that it means to the world
95893 although such outbreaks are difficult to control this may be possible by combining rigorous infection control measures with appropriate use of antibiotics
95894 that was the conclusion of a group of leading european scientists working on behalf of the centre to analyse existing protocols and make recommendations on infection control measures to limit the spread of c difficile
95895 though c difficile as such is not a new microbe the emergence and spread of hyper virulent new strains mostly the so called pcr ribotype 027 have contributed to multiple outbreaks in hospitals and care homes in

95897 were not going to be clashing with the minister or rte on it we have to work together
95898 wed like to launch early in the year rte would like to launch late hopefully we can meet somewhere in the middle
95899 doing something in january is a fantasy because the network just wont be there
95900 you could launch some services in february or march but theyd be very unreliable it wont be reliable until july at the earliest
95901 weve gone for an october launch because we know it will be reliable by then to launch any earlier youd risk giving the whole system a bad name
95902 were investing a lot of money in this and once we start the clock starts ticking on that so we wont start until were ready

95910 this is one bleeding part of a budget and not just in one department but in a lot of departments
95911 when you have something bleeding like this there can be a lot of money saved
95912 from a management standpoint this is something that can easily be handled
95913 its critical use or necessary use versus well weve got the money lets go out and buy some more cars
95914 where that spike in overall costs came from i have no idea
95915 cost of paying one driver overtime to cover both weekday shifts and weekends would be prohibitive

95922 unsubstantiated allegations can do severe damage to a teachers reputation
95923 this decision will help protect good hardworking teachers who are dedicated to helping their kids get a good education
95924 we are surprised and deeply disappointed by the courts decision
95925 in fact it could even give the districts an incentive to do a shoddy investigation a finding of unsubstantiated can now protect them from public scrutiny
95926 the mere fact of the allegation of sexual misconduct toward a minor may hold the teacher up to hatred and ridicule in the community without any evidence that such misconduct ever occurred
95927 predatory teachers may go undetected and unpunished but the most unfortunate consequence and one that is completely unacceptable is that if predatory teachers are undetected children will continue to suffer at their hands
95928 it is important to bear in mind that unsubstantiated does not mean untrue
95929 we dont expect this will change the outcome at all
95930 we said lets go back to miyamoto to give a final yep this is right we believe this is the conclusion he will come to
95931 im glad the states going to hire him but it all depends on the scope of his work
95932 it doesnt make sense if you dont do a thorough job wed love to see an adequate thorough study of the viaduct to do this in 60 hours is not adequate
95933 i am delighted that the washington state dot has consented to engage miyamoto assuming that their contract would include a complete and full analysis of retrofit options including ground soil issues superstructure and technical feasibility and financial cost analysis
95934 any less than a full analysis of a range of retrofit options by miyamoto would not satisfy the mission of the viaduct advisory committee to fully vet all alternatives to solving the viaduct issue i dont believe a valid evaluation can be completed with 40 hours of work
95935 kit told me in a conference call last week that anything less than a full analysis would be a waste of money
95936 were not going to authorize 400 000 worth of work when we had a number of panels look at the very issues he identified at the end of his study
95937 weve invested a lot into these issues this is not work that needs to be redone from scratch
95938 what weve said all along is that it is technically feasible to do some level of a retrofit
95939 this brought us back full circle to where weve always been on the retrofit its probably possible to do it but at very high costs
95940 we dont expect this will change the outcome at all

95953 he was an ideal managing partner who kept us on course financially and morally
95954 he had an extremely rare combination of qualities great lawyer excellent business sense and great compassion
95955 he was able to balance being a lawyer and having a family and putting family first in a way that i think a lot of lawyers dont
95956 he was not easily shaken he was philosophical even when faced with his own death i think his family and all of us will carry brad inside us

95965 the biggest incident which clouds all his subsequent behavior occurred on june 5
95966 brandished the gun from the back waistband of his jeans and pointed it at me
95967 all he said was i heard about your son how good he is and told her she s doing a great job
95968 we consider this incident an inadvertent mistake we have contacted both the conference conference usa office and the ncaa with the information
95969 they leave huge destruction in their wake and they are not a wild herd
95970 we could protect the crops somehow we could reimburse the farmers that have crop damage and call it a day

95975 if you dont fix this youre not going to be here
95976 i was kind of surprised to be honest with you
95977 and im very thankful for the opportunity and coach holmgren and his staff and the people in the front office for believing in me after going through what i went through last year
95978 hey its a tough business sometimes if he couldnt handle that little bit with me it gets a lot harder than that
95979 id been a school teacher for a long time now and so i kind of know how its going to work before i do something at least i think i do i try not to back a player into a corner unless i think im going to get the response i need

95987 given that bacterial vaginosis and hiv infection are both transmitted sexually it is difficult to determine whether associations found are causal or if there is some other reason why women with bv are more likely than others to become infected with hiv
95988 if additional follow up studies show that there was a relationship between bv and the risk of incident hiv infection though then increasing the treatment of bv could be considered for the future prevention of hiv infection

95996 iron is the single most important micronutrient bacteria need to survive
95997 understanding how these bacteria thrive within us is a critical element of learning how to defeat them
95998 its amazing that the bacteria could learn to extract iron from their environment in this way we went into these experiments with no idea that this mechanism existed but then bacteria have to be creative to survive in some very hostile environments and theyve had maybe 3 5 billion years to figure it out

96022 solidarno has become a part of polish history and has been defended by the successive polish governments something that the czech government has clearly less done for the prague spring
96023 however i remain convinced that the prague spring has played an absolutely fundemental role
96024 i think the dissidents of solidarno have drawn the lessons of the prague spring failure
96025 if bronislav geremek the polish dissident and center right politician who recently died in a car accident was still among us he could have explained to what extent the crackdown on the prague spring has marked mentalities in poland for example

96027 this investigation is in response to concerns raised by a small number of staff
96028 we have identified around 25 people and they are a myriad of different cancer types
96029 so 25 is not a big number over 2 000 and weve had a diversity of different cancers
96030 we really felt that if staff are concerned about it the only way to address those concerns was to retain some consultants and conduct a proper and thorough investigation so we can give them a high level of comfort that there isnt a problem

96043 the hawke building captures the changing role of the university and the architecture of education in the civic life of a city it orchestrates connections between its public and private spaces and fulfils the city of adelaides intentions for strong north south public links
96044 exacting in its functionality exquisite in its detailing and serene in its confidence the architecture provides the school with a contemporary signature framing its historic identity
96045 south australian architecture is in great shape especially when considered over a broader period of time than any one year
96046 urgent action is needed as we face the challenges presented by climate change this potential can be realized by reducing energy demand and increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and infrastructure systems
96047 there is an urgent need to think through viable options for hobart and its surrounding population
96048 housing across australia and in tasmania is at a crossroads
96049 this means we need to emphasise reliable affordable and accessible transport options and their connection with a mix of well designed private and public housing
96050 hobart will need to engage with these issues to ensure we have the infrastructure to future proof the local economy and maximize the advantages this will offer to all tasmanians
96051 the principal advantage of a public transport corridor operating along the existing rail corridor is a new amenity which can be afforded to those people living in the northern suburbs and the potential improvement of pedestrian amenity within the city centre through a reduction in cars
96052 light rail or retrofitted buses could use state of the art technology to then be able to ride on the rail corridor which would create a new express route to the centre of hobart use of the rail corridor for public transportation purposes would also open up a range of options for sustainable development including low cost urban housing along the route
96053 there is also significant potential for a tourist service along the corridor offering attractions including the royal botanic gardens the transport museum moorilla winery and the emerging mona museum and could include connections further afield to brighton and the new norfolk area
96054 the research findings clearly showed that the word royal was seen as out of touch and not of contemporary relevance so for everyday use we will trade under the new name

96056 on behalf of the profession i would like to congratulate ms cox on her appointment and for the significant contribution she will bring to this role
96057 i would also like to extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of mr ius who likewise had shown himself to be a selfless campaigner for the architectural community and ethical architecture
96058 we congratulate geoffrey on his appointment and applaud the state government for continuing this important independent role
96059 during his time as government architect john denton provided victoria with high level design advice and design leadership on architectural and urban design victorians can look forward to professor london continuing to promote the benefits of innovative high quality design throughout the state
96060 the institute welcomes recommendations in the report to retain canberra as a planned national capital
96061 this is an essential step if we are to retain the essence of canberra as a uniquely planned and highly successful city
96062 in line with this we also commend the committees recommendation to appoint a commonwealth architect within the department of prime minister and cabinet
96063 the appointment of a commonwealth government architect would follow similar moves by most of australias eight states and territories with all but two now appointing state government architects to provide significant design leadership on architectural and urban design issues
96064 its extremely gratifying that at a time when wa is enjoying a boom of new building activity the architecture profession continues to make a significant contribution to the conservation of our built heritage
96065 the architecture profession applauds the appointment of philip follent to the position and sees this as a solid commitment by the government to ensuring the best possible built environment outcomes for the state
96066 mr follent is one of the states most highly esteemed architects being valued for his architectural output and for his tremendous contribution in recent years as gold coast city architect

96074 rouse hill town centre boasts a small town square but its real success is the pattern of open streets and partially covered laneways that hark back to traditional suburban shopping centres rouse hill breaks away from the big box model of internal retail centres that exclude uses and users the traditional big box retail supermarket and super stores are pushed to the corners and accessed through the laneways in subsequent stages of development a ring of residential buildings will surround and mask these elements the town embracing the town centre in the face of the many difficulties of retail investment this is a great achievement as it establishes a new model for town centre development in nsw
96075 while recognising that it is the institutes goal to have sustainability embedded within the criteria for all awards no longer necessitating the consideration of sustainability for an individual award this aim remains to be achieved the jury believes outstanding projects that clearly and innovatively improve sustainable practice in architecture require recognition for their role in leading the way of course a future when all buildings designed and built will inherently demonstrate a high degree of measurable environmental performance and consider all aspects of sustainability in a rigorous and comprehensive manner is the final objective

96081 the overall impression of edo is one of calm of generosity its a building that works on passive energy principles and is skilfully and thoughtfully designed for compact inner city living
96082 like a literal square peg in a round hole the original apartment layout made a clumsy use of the available space with poor integration of services in sharp contrast the new layout is a fluid sequence of radial spaces

96092 what i found increasingly in the scream series is that the script were being written while we were shooting the first one was a written script it went out to the whole town and the weinsteins jumped on it there was very little changed in that but 2 and 3 there were a lot of other people including myself writing on those
96093 crazy tribes brutal terrain vicious combat hellacious weather anabasis is full of astounding endurance and heroism
96094 the majority are being caught in the shrimp trawls particularly in the gulf of mexico
96095 a lot of those sharks that are being landed are undersized
96096 thats putting a lot of pressure on those young sharks
96097 provider microsoft jet oledb 4 0 data source datadirectory nwind2003 good mdb
96098 if youve heard of gears or browserplus chances are youve heard them positioned as competitors in one way or another another google vs yahoo showdown truth is thats not the case at all or at least doesnt have to be after taking a look at what these technologies actually offer we can see that theyre actually two distinct approaches to an exciting new direction for the web
96099 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
96100 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
96101 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
96102 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public
96103 we came to entertain well but the tongans are very strong and congratulations to them on winning today
96104 if we win we cancel out the defeat to the falcons
96105 to finish the first round of the currie cup on 21 or 22 points wouldnt be bad at all particularly if you consider that most of our second round games are at home
96106 we would like to turn it around and keep the consistency going
96107 we are going up there with the intention of coming home with the points which would be a breakthrough in turning around the season altogether
96108 things would then look good because the majority of our second round games are at home
96109 it would not be easy though before the game against the natal sharks the lions had back to back wins and it will be a massive challenge
96110 they only have one player out on springbok duty while we have eleven and that must make a difference
96111 it is however a challenge for us and we are really looking forward to playing them up there and we must just make sure we win the game this weekend
96112 we western province dont want go up against the lions lacking in pace on attack and defence
96113 when the game opens up we may play with four loose forwards
96114 its going to a tough game and we have to have guys who are quick around the park to shut down their chasing lines
96115 if there is an opportunity to run it the ball then we have the pace on the bench
96116 on saturday well see a great battle on the ground they have some great ball stealers
96117 i havent got a bad word to say about the place
96118 weve got our first trial game in a couple of weeks and then four weeks after that our first home game
96119 everyone has talked up the toulon crowd and i cant wait to run out there and be a part of it
96120 they find you a place to live and give you a car straight away when you get here when the season starts they will put me into french school as well
96121 i think if i could have picked one dream club to come to when i obviously parted way with the force it would have been toulon
96122 i think its an attractive option for the top australian players that are earning big money in australia but they could earn a lot more over here without the salary cap put on them
96123 and its an attractive place i suppose for fringe australian players
96124 theres 14 teams in france and only four in australia so theres a lot more opportunity over here to get a start and play in a premier competition whereas the opportunities in australia may be a little more limited
96125 every player that is australian always has a dream of playing for the wallabies and i have not closed that door and hopefully the aru hasnt closed that door on me either
96126 i think dwayne will prove to be a very good signing
96127 his form with the scarlets fell off a bit last season but that happens to even world class players and make no mistake this guy is world class
96128 dwayne wont be a weakness in any way shape or form you need quality people who have gained experience at the top level and he will provide that
96129 i think given his extensive experience you would have to say that right now peel would be ahead of wigglesworth in the pecking order
96130 having broken into the england set up last season wigglesworth would have been on the crest of a wave and i thought he performed admirably during what has been a difficult time for england
96131 so he will have been disappointed to only be selected for the england saxons squad next season but you can bet he will more than keep peel on his toes it means sale have got two very very good scrum halves
96132 from philippe point of view he knows its now a 22 man game
96133 the season is so physical intense and brutal that you need quality back up and we all know that number nine is the most important position on the rugby field
96134 i also think peels recruitment shows good intent from owner brian kennedy and the club as a whole that as with mathew tait as well they are bringing in players of proven quality
96135 it means they are investing in the future and that future as far as sale are concerned should mean silverware
96136 he will have been disappointed that he was dropped from the wales team that went on to win the six nations grand slam and hell be keen and hungry as will richard
96137 so you are going to have two top class scrum halves going head to head and it will be fascinating
96138 in terms of dwaynes arrival at edgeley park im a great believer in competition
96139 the surgery and rehab have gone well and all i want now is an injury free season for club and country
96140 i still want to play for wales and that doesnt change by moving to sale
96141 it is just a case of playing club rugby in the guinness premiership
96142 dwaynes arrival is excellent news for the club and our supporters
96143 he is a world class scrum half and together with richard it means we will have two young international players covering the number nine position
96144 dwayne will only help richard improve competition for places is good it keeps you on your toes and makes you a better player
96145 i went into the office and spoke with philippe about it but he was very positive about me and sees me as a big part of his plans and i hope that continues
96146 so much worse could happen but it makes you feel like youve been invaded someone is taking liberties on your property that you would never take with anyone else
96147 if youre just driving around you might not notice it
96148 there are things you can do individually though to save energy
96149 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
96150 a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
96151 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
96152 if its too dangerous to touch it cant be clean
96153 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public
96154 if you read the literature it says the vipers bites are pretty benign
96155 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad

96158 while this slight change in shank diameter might not seem like much it provides a tremendous strength improvement for a product that is used by millions of golfers
96159 this new improvement along with the continued use of 100 white birch wood will keep breakage at a minimum and allow golfers longer usage from their pts tees thus increasing the value of one of the games great staple products

96173 we can confirm that nia witts has been found safe and well in belgium
96174 he has no legitimacy not from the public nor the knesset nor the government to reach any understandings with the palestinians or with syria that would bind the government
96175 unless we change how we do business were looking at double digit tax increases for the next 10 or 15 years
96176 theres not a resident or a business in this community that can afford double digit tax increases we would absolutely kill ourselves and our tax base
96177 theyre going to see more efficient police protection more reliable police protection at a considerable cost savings
96178 i would suspect that the criminal elements that surround us will flourish under a situation where theres not that type of presence
96179 to eliminate a local police force is the act of a dying community cass lake is not a dying community we need to go forward and the staple of our community is our local police force
96180 i think that networking and collaboration is increasing not only between local units of government but especially law enforcement agencies
96181 when those efforts actually result in savings i think thats an opportunity that we shouldnt pass up
96182 they really dont care whats written on the side of the truck that plows the snow in the winter but for some reason they really like to have their town sort of emblazoned on the side of a patrol car

96193 hey this war is a noble crusade and bush is the messiah
96194 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
96195 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
96196 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
96197 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
96198 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it then dropped it on the ground in front of us
96199 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
96200 he sat in the front in the beginning everything seemed normal
96201 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a cigarette with a young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
96202 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
96203 about a half an hour later we heard this bloodcurdling scream
96204 we want to make sure that the process is followed as aggressively as possible a full legal process and that the perpetrator is dealt with the full force of the law

96211 one of obamas earmark requests was for the hospital that employs michelle obama

96216 arrogant beligerint impatient litiguous sexist racist close minded borderline theocratic
96217 i believe that we are the most perfect country in the world not perfect but closer than anyone else
96218 i get that its a joke but there are parts of this joke i see as an insult to people of a perfectly reasonable faith
96219 a lot of people who will not vote for obama are saying its because hes a
96220 if obamas relationship with ayers however tangential exposes obama as a radical himself or at least as a man with terrible judgment he shares that radicalism or terrible judgment with a comically respectable list of chicagoans and others including republicans and conservatives who have embraced ayers and dohrn as good company good citizens even experts on childrens issues
96221 is this association between obama and these dangerous radicals a scandal or is the scandal digging up all this ancient history those have been the options in the debate but the truth is a third option ayers and dohrn are despicable and yet making an issue of obamas relationship with them is absurd
96222 in america we believe in redemption and even self reinvention
96223 ayers and dohrn never posed any real threat to u s national security their asinine chatter about killing people and their anti american sloganeering were as ineffective as their bombs
96224 when it became clear even to them that there would not be violent revolution in america ayers and dohrn shrugged and rejoined society in chicago where he had grown up
96225 in a way the joke is on ayers and dohrn for heavens sake what does it take to upset these brahmins but in a bigger way the joke is on the rest of us we thought they meant what they said
96226 was a 1960s leader of the homegrown terrorist group weatherman a communist driven splinter faction of students for a democratic society
96227 kill all the rich people break up their cars and apartments bring the revolution home kill your parents
96228 his terrorist campaign across america and his enduring hatred for for the united states
96229 is there anything here that raises questions about obamas judgment or is this just another example of guilt by association
96230 so just because he has an association hes a terrorist supporter
96231 we can only assume your ill timed and poorly conceived pursuit of republic is designed to disrupt what you perceive as a competitive threat to your position in the market an acquisition of republic will most certainly burden the company with excessive debt distract your management result in significant regulatory burdens and thereby reduce shareholder value

96237 when i start thinking of the configuration of the property and the challenges that weve talked about it seems kind of high
96238 this law addresses what weve known for a long time that people who are doing things other than driving while theyre driving are more likely to be involved in an accident
96239 we saw exactly that kind of evolution with the seat belt law that has been so successful

96270 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
96271 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton rev jackson sen mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics

96292 mensen leven in armoedige omstandigheden deze ramp is letterlijk de druppel die de emmer doet overlopen predikanten en gemeenteleden van de lokale kerken kunnen nu financi le en geestelijke steun geven
96293 we willen graag dat ze een aardse plek hebben waar ze veilig kunnen wonen
96294 maar bovenal dat ze door het evangelie jezus christus leren kennen als hun persoonlijke verlosser zodat ze een eeuwig thuis krijgen
96295 tijdens haar ziekte heeft het ons aan niets ontbroken we beseften wat een voorrecht het is om in nederland te wonen ouders van gehandicapte kinderen in oost europa voelen hetzelfde verdriet maar de maatschappij reageert heel hard op deze kinderen ze worden opgenomen in een instituut want zo wordt gezegd dan zijn we ervan af
96296 de president zei niets over het belasten van de mijnbedrijven het optrekken van lonen en pensioenen of concrete maatregelen om stijgende kosten van levensonderhoud aan te pakken
96297 sinds mijn doctoraat in de theologie heb ik met de inquisitie te maken
96298 de meeste intellectuelen en creatieve geesten verlaten de kerk of kiezen voor de innerlijke emigratie
96299 een vertegenwoordiger van het redelijke midden zij het met de nadruk op vernieuwing en hervorming
96300 niet de blijvende concentratie van de macht in het centrum zou zijn doel zijn maar de pretentieloze dienst aan de rijke verscheidenheid van de plaatselijke kerken binnen de ene kerk
96301 een andere vraag in hoeverre ratzinger zich de fundamentele bedoeling van de reformatie echt eigen heeft gemaakt
96302 joseph ratzinger is van begin af aan en blijft ook nog als paus een theoloog van het latijnse rooms katholieke paradigma van de christenheid
96303 oleme saanud vihjeid veest varemgi n iteks mars odyssey on vee olemasolu orbiidilt kindlaks teinud kuid n d on esimene kord kus marsi vett on katsutud ja anal situd vahetult
96304 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
96305 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
96306 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
96307 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
96308 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
96309 they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale

96312 its been fabulous watching him it really has but it had gone on enough it was time
96313 maybe thats why the team wasnt playing so well enough of his mouth hes a great player but enough is enough move on
96314 i dont think there was a breaking point but kind of a gradual thing
96315 how many times can you take the conversation i want to be traded i want to be traded it kind of wore everybody out
96316 i always thought he was a crybaby and a selfish ballplayer
96317 i dont think that comes into our thought process charlie has pitched as well as anybody has pitched in triple a this year thats what he needs to do to get to the big leagues its not going to be a function of what the rotation looks like
96318 i think theres two things in play that weve seen this year that have really helped
96319 i think the maturity factor the learning the knuckleball the consistency of his knuckleball i think the commitment to his knuckleball tim wakefield doesnt throw 2 and 0 fastballs you have to be able to throw a 2 and 0 knuckleball or else youre going to get hammered and charlie has finally i think found the conviction to throw that knuckleball four fifths of the time
96320 he doesnt probably know exactly where its going i think that takes a lot of guts to do that i think thats the maturity side that were seeing
96321 now its finally to the point where im not ever worried about throwing a ball full counts ill throw a knuckleball still i dont worry about walking people anymore
96322 a lot of it is me just having to believe in it i always wanted to go back to throwing hard now i know i cant do that anymore so i have to be able to figure it out to throw consistent knuckleballs up there that will move and hopefully not get hit hard
96323 if he stays healthy hell be in the big leagues within i think two three years whether its in the bullpen or the back end of a rotation
96324 he knows how to pitch with brock everythings easy hes one of those kids that throws an easy looking fastball that jumps on you his command hell throw a fastball where he wants to throw it in whatever quadrant of the plate hes going
96325 as far as im concerned manny can stay in my guest house
96326 from kilokri and kotla mubarakpur in the south east to karol bagh in delhis north west almost every new colony post partition has been settled on farm land those settled by the government were given water electricity and drainage and became proper colonies those settled by private individuals were denied these basic amenities and termed illegal or unauthorised
96327 the process began two and a half years before the elections and so should not be seen as a sudden decision or a knee jerk reaction
96328 in the 2003 elections sheila dixits government was able to divert electoral anger to the bjp government in the centre
96329 but the same strategy cannot work with the congress in power in the state and the centre
96330 stretching the resources of the municipal authorities beyond what was originally planned to the limit of the breakdown of these services
96331 in the process of sponsoring motivating and encouraging the setting up of these unauthorised and subsequently regularised colonies the interests of the under privileged persons do not really get served they are encouraged to act illegally and to gain from such illegal acts their moral fabric gets undermined they get encouraged to dispose of the illegally secured gains and move over to other areas for creating new unauthorised colonies and these measures inevitably generate an atmosphere of crime as well as develop a nexus between property dealers and land grabbers the operation of the land mafia and a general lowering of the standards of morals
96332 by giving this permission on the provision of sewerage facilities this court has not expressed any opinion about the regularisation of such unauthorised colonies
96333 we have metalled almost all the roads in our constituency
96334 a continuous urban spread constituting the urban population of a town or city and its adjoining urban outgrowths ogs or two or more physically contiguous towns together with their ogs india defines its urban agglomerations in a quirky way they cannot cross state boundaries this has no effect upon the population size of kolkata and greater mumbai ua which are located far from their state borders but it does affect delhi
96335 in the period of the second master plan 1981 2001 dda estimated that new housing of 16 lakhs would be required in fact dda was able to provide land and housing for only 5 5 lakhs dwelling units dus roughly 34 per cent of the target even within this greatly reduced number there was a bias against the poor 70 per cent of the housing to be built was supposed to cater to the ews 40 and lig 30 however only 58 per cent of the housing actually built was allotted to poorer groups while for the rich the target was over achieved by more than three times
96336 primarily due to the sky rocketing land prices in the national capital and the inability of the large majority of migrant as well as local population to afford shelter

96355 the movie is about a little girl who goes to the national pop warner event the first ever and plays the quarterback position its called longshots she and her uncle ice cube theyre taking a long shot as a team
96356 the amazing part to me is its a true story and that this really happened
96357 it happened around 2000 the girl is 15 now it happened it in harvey illinois and the funny thing is that harvey is not too far from where i grew up
96358 i went through a month of football training like 100 balls a day i was throwing them getting the mechanics and getting the footwork
96359 i got a lot of muscles and now im even better with my athletic ability
96360 ive done a little bit and people tell me id do good cause i have long fingers so i could play basketball or that i should do ballet or be a gymnast but i just never tried it when i did the movie the guy that was coaching me he told me im really athletic maybe i should really try it one day
96361 then i got signed on to the project i just kind of had a meeting and talked about what id done and what attracted me to the movie it wasnt like and audition audition they were persistent on me being able to do the moves
96362 i found out a little bit about her she plays basketball now
96363 i asked her why she made the change and she said it was because her mom was concerned the boys were getting older when they were younger they were pretty much the same size but as she got older the boys got older and stronger and tougher and meaner so her mom told her she didnt want her doing it anymore
96364 when i did the movie i asked the guys playing on the team if they thought i was a tom boy or a girly girl they said i could be both i think thats pretty good i can be both i can be versatile
96365 im really blessed right now and i hope everything continues to do well im just really excited about everything going on and i just hope it continues
96366 its about how she deals with that and realizes that even though its in an adult world its not too different from high school
96367 it means a lot for me for my peers to know what im doing for me to be on a network like nickelodeon means theyre really going to see me and i can reach out to them more it will help my music career and then when a movie comes out theyll also be able to see me on the movie so i think mixing both is really going to help me and im happy that im able to do that right now
96368 i felt the documentary gave kids and young adults with the same issues as me inspiration i feel like it has helped me to grow a lot with the things that i have experienced and gone through with my mother
96369 i also felt like it showed who i really was as a young man outside of the music because sometimes you can get lost in that box of being just a teen more than that
96370 we have all made mistakes we have all erred and we ought not try to sugar coat when we err
96371 but we should not throw away everything when we err and to say that rev jackson made a mistake is correct but to act like rev jesse jackson is not pivotal to our movement our history is wrong
96372 the bias in the media is they try to act like we cant have multiple strategists
96373 today represents a milestone in our nations efforts to remedy the ills of our past
96374 the lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against african americans under slavery and jim crow
96375 were brutalized humiliated dehumanized and subjected to the indignity of being stripped of their names and heritage
96376 apologizes to african americans on behalf of the people of the united states for the wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and jim crow
96377 slavery and jim crow are stains upon what is the greatest nation on the face of the earth
96378 is such a resolution as we have before us today where we face up to our mistakes and apologize as anyone should apologize for things that were done in the past that were wrong

96387 i ovog puta pokazali da su uz srpski narod da ine sve da olak aju borbu za opstanak i povratak na kosovo i o uvanje pokrajine u sastavu srbije
96388 iz orsokaka u koji se do lo jednostranim progla enjem nezavisnosti kosova najbolji izlaz bi bio nastavak pregovora o statusu a potpisom srbije na ssp sa eu jo jednom u ruci imamo potvrdu rezolucije 1244 pa tu nema govora o odricanju od kosova
96389 ali hajde da ponovim elementarnu injenicu potpisivanjem sporazuma ne samo da se ne priznaje nezavisnost kosova ve se pove ava snaga zemlje i potencijali za odbranu na ih vitalnih interesa
96390 novi premijer mnogo vi e bavi ekonomskim pitanjima nego politikom
96391 nije dobro da iko nastupa ucenjuju i i takvo pona anje za meni nije prihvatljivo
96392 prihvati u argumentaciju koja proistekne iz ozbiljne analize pravnih eksperata a po to je ovo jedno ozbiljno dr avno pravno pitanje potpuno je besmisleno da se to ekspertsko pitanje pretvara u strana ko nadgornjavanje
96393 dobro je i zbog ekonomskih perspektiva na e privrede i zbog injenice da se njime nedvosmisleno potvrdjuje rezolucija 1244 sporazum je dobar za srbiju bez obzira na izbore i bez obzira na to da li e se potpisati pre ili posle 11 maja ali dobro je da se to desi
96394 o odricanju nema ni govora potpisom na sporazum jo jednom u ruci imamo potvrdu rezolucije 1244 a to je jedini medjunarodno priznati pravni akt koji potvrdjuje status kosova unutar srbije u situaciji posle kumanovskog vojno tehni kog sporazuma 1999 godine
96395 eventualna vlada srs i dss vodila iskrenu antievropsku i izolacionisti ku politiku koja bi dugoro no blokirala razvoj srbije
96396 srbija bi u takvim uslovima ekonomski nazadovala duboko sam uveren da bi to jako tetilo interesima zemlje i gradjana i da bi je slabilo na svaki na in pa i onemogu avalo da nastavi borbu za kosovo
96397 destruktivan potencijal radikala na svojoj ko i osetili svi u srbiji devedestih godina
96398 nikada mi niko nije rekao tako ne to niti postavio takav uslov ali fakat je da protivnika evropskog puta srbije ima i u evropi i u srbiji i zanimljivo je gledati kako uskladjeno deluju tokom ove kampanje potpuno sam siguran da su ta dva cilja odbrana kosova i eu medjusobno povezana i da bez uklju ivanja u svet srbija ne mo e da brani integritet zemlje
96399 sude i po izjavama i radikala i dss a to izgleda realno
96400 zato zahtevam da se ta odluka revidira i srbija e pomo i tu ila tvu da obnovi proces haradinaju koji je optu en za te ke zlo ine nad srbima romima i albancima
96401 pitanje pridru ivanja evropskoj uniji je pitanje na kom je pala vlada srbije
96402 pitanje evrope koje je bitno za svakog pojedinca u srbije se dnavno politizuje odgovor na to pitanje je kako emo ivati ve za godinu dana to je i odgovor da li e u zemlji biti stranih investicija odnosno etiri milijarde evra za infrastrukturu zatim odgovor za zaposljavanje 50 000 ljudi
96403 ruska vlada je sa velikim razumevanjem prihvatila da sve miruje do 11 maja dogovoreno je da se eka formiranje novog parlamenta i ne e biti nikakvih pritisaka sa ruske strane da se to dogodi br e
96404 koja je shvatila na u predizbornu kompanju i na u predizbornu groznicu
96405 elim jo jednom da zahvalim ruskoj vladi posebno hristenku na velikom razumevanju na e situacije naravno oni ne ele da navijaju u na oj kampanji ali se raduju to e sporazum posle biti ratifikovan to je ju e i dogovoreno na sednici vlade srbije
96406 jeste ali mi smo morali zvani no to da dogovorimo
96407 koriste i 17 februar kada je u pri tini albanski parlament jednostrano proglasio nezavisnost
96408 od trenutka potpisivanja sporazuma o stabilizaciji i pridru ivanju pa za naredne tri godine kao kandidat za lanstvo iz predpristupnih fondova eu srbija bi dobila ogromna sredstva od nekoliko milijardi evra bespovratno od kojih bi u naredne tri godine 200 000 ljudi dobilo posao
96409 od projekata koji bi se pokrenuli tim sredstvima naredne tri godine 200 000 ljudi dobilo bi posao

96414 the lawrences private family farm is populated with many different animals it is not uncommon to secure an off season hunting license in rural areas and is quite common for the oiling of eggs
96415 a hunting license has been applied for by the property manager at the same time martin has actively been exploring all possible humane ways to handle the overpopulation issue while intending to do everything possible to preserve the animal habitat in which they reside there are many different enterprises in rural va that make their living assisting property owners on how to handle and manage migratory geese it is unfortunate that a neighbor who has never met martin or discussed the matter with him would make this issue public without knowing all of the facts or the lawrence familys intentions
96416 it is another example of hateful sexist language being used on the campaign trail and now is our moment to make it clear not on our watch the leadership of both parties must step up to condemn such hateful speech and demand apologies the obama campaign has criticized the lyrics but we call on the presumptive party nominee who is the celebrated subject of the new song to go even further publicly condemn the song demand an apology on behalf of the targets now
96417 this is about beginning the grinding and painful process of rooting out this kind of hate language and behavior whenever and wherever it exists the democratic leadership have pledged to unhinge our nation from gender bias hate language and misogyny and we are taking them at their word
96418 i may just be a small drop in this vast universe but to my loved ones i am their universe

96420 hes got a dog a doberman pinscher named belle every day he takes belle for a walk in the morning and nearly every morning his neighbor leans out her window or peeks out her door and yells at him shes convinced that his dog is pooping on her lawn now i know my son in law he may not be much of a husband but he takes better care of that dog than he does himself and he always has a plastic bag or three with him to pick up after her
96421 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed
96422 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard
96423 dave says the neighbor hasnt so much as looked at him since

96564 the doom and gloom attitude should be about the drastically low level of sales which affects the wider economy not about falling prices unless you are trading down inheriting or in danger of negative equity the effect of falling prices is neutral or indeed good for some

96704 i know i know how often you think about him the boy that is what youve wanted to do the vindication the the vengeance and i was thinking maybe theres a place for it here where consequence isnt as bad as it may seem as though it should be perhaps not simply for his acts against you but his overall person maybe you have the right to do what you want to do after all you know who is it you answer to well its no one whos opinion rests here or there
96705 perhaps thinking about all he has what has he done to earn any of it theres no fairness in it no fairness at all everyone finds their own strife no matter what the life he has chosen to make himself his own strife though things are never as terrible as he makes them out to be and his competitive nature allows him to feel that his wrongs are incomparable to those that have wronged him as if his love is more powerful than others but your love is more pure we both know this the difference in actions is enough proof of that the understanding of its nature the comprehension of moral placement as it affects effect you deserve the opportunities that he takes for granted
96706 hm ive just come to an understanding about you eris you truly are of two sides but unlike the modern expression of a two sided character one side of good and one of evil you are of two evil sides on one side you are of the strife of war loud explosive violent wrathful and on the other you are of competitive strife and i thought it was just a clever name his death may be of no consequence to me but im not going to be the one to kill him
96707 oh but its consideration doesnt go without merit the brutal nature of his action has constituted a far worse fate in the past of what consequence would come to you for making nothing more than an outdated judgment
96708 not because he thought it wrong to kill a man for betrayal you have a hand over caesar youre still alive and capable of justice
96709 of course it is its you who was betrayed he who claimed the diadem of protector from you he who led himself to believe he was in some greater understanding of your situation and of hers he who convinced her of common interests that we both know likely do not truly exist at least not to the extent im sure he expressed them to be so why should it not be your face he sees just before mine oh i see what is it thats holding you back what is it that worries you who is keeping you in check
96710 ha just the cop out i was expecting from you its not god that has you tied to some righteousness no not the alpha and omega emmanuel lord king man upstairs big guy big cheese huh uh in fact it isnt even above certain basic morals
96711 what would she think god knows youd never see her again
96712 you think you can make me believe im crazy because ive had thoughts of such a thing but its not above anyone to have those kind of thoughts its whether or not you react to them that separates the sane from the insane
96713 oh but the pleasure of it have you forgotten the felicity of your hands around his neck the scruff between your index fingers and thumbs the skin under your fingernails the grease on your fingertips the scratching at your arms squeezing and squeezing until you can no longer feel the moisture of his breath on your wrists and nothing but dead weight even the cigarette following
96714 yes i remember i have not forgotten the intensity of it
96715 to allow so many to believe that hes so terribly complicated that hes so beautifully passionate its nauseating
96716 and to refute it all you are considered nothing more than invidious
96717 hes a thief he steals from his own imagination an image of himself as he would like to be rather than who he really is if he were to become this image it would be different but he has not and cannot he cannot because he will never be able to refuse those pleasures that allow him to forget the line between himself and the image of himself
96718 why not i find no melange of opinion over the boy
96719 the relevance has nothing to do with differing opinions i just wish not to elaborate on a despondency that has already been made quite clear
96720 you honestly consider it a despondency id thought there was a bit more fervor behind it a bit more wrath no despondence isnt the state of mind id have chosen to describe it far too many paroxysmic fits of rage its much more liken to acrimony you like to give yourself less credit than you deserve when regarding the amount of hatred that youre capable of i only assumed that these little conversations may be a sort of catharsis for you
96721 the necessity for a catharsis has passed all youre trying to do is galvanize my rage i might not have noticed quite as much if you hadnt brought eris with you you mustve known that id taken an interest in the mythology of the character not long after that familiar name resurfaced itself
96722 of course but remember its mythology eris is not the mythological character you read about
96723 the only difference between the two is the word mythological her personality is what would be expected from a modernized version of the ancient grecian eris now i dont know whether or not eris has shown both sides to but after this im quite sure of who she is or at least who she represents i think its time her use to you be expired
96724 the knowledge of her identity may have allowed you to develop a resistance to her methods but her contact with you is not where her power against you resides regardless of your own personal ability to neutralize the emotion that eris here might incite it is s renitence that will always come to define your standing with eris and even your standing with
96725 my standing with will never be in the hands of a cruger esque eidolon
96726 believe of her what you will but though her verges seem clear youve given her far too little credit shes affected you and your friend far beyond the realm of dreams eris has affected you both mentally and physically in the conscious world
96727 s life has improved ive left her stress has reduced dramatically
96728 you give yourself too much credit though your disappearance has aided the reduction of her stress you are not the cause
96729 regardless ive seen no activity from that would merit the idea that eris has been at her again
96730 irrelevant she no longer lives with him shes dating someone else someone that she likes a great deal someone that will treat her well enough she has a job that she enjoys she has friends that will take care of her she has no reason to fall apart at the feet of eris
96731 you feign solace well you havent felt comfortable with this new lover since you met him you tried as you always do but at the core of you you see the same lack of initiative that made you leery of c the same apathy that characterizes the type of boy that she feels she relates to the type of boy we both know in the end will find himself overwhelmed by her and succumb steadily to introversion and irritation eventually leading to anger
96732 i refuse to develop a pretense against him regardless of my history judging well the result of her decisions it is wrong of me to presume that experience trumps equity
96733 you only say this to allow yourself to put her out of your mind
96734 i have to put her out of my mind i am not her keeper
96735 but youre the only man that will do it unconditionally or effectively for that matter
96736 she wont you also worry about the general state of that house
96737 i never went there with any intention of becoming some religious zealot
96738 but on a number of occasions youve shaken your head at the fact that they drink regularly at her house
96739 i shake my head not because of some judgmental shame on them attitude i shake my head because i worry that its becoming another method of escape for her but who am i to talk of alcoholism the last time i visited her all i did was drink her beer and attempt to minimize conversation with her
96740 and why do you suppose you did such a thing
96741 bullshit you did it out of fear you were afraid that if you reestablished a connection you would return to cincinnati and relapse into another depression that might leave you cripplingly underweight and physically ill stop trying to hide from the fact that she affects you so much
96742 its unhealthy for a person to be affected in that way by another its a sign of dependence
96743 its a sign of love you couldnt control what happened to you following the incident hell you had every reason to be affected the way you were stop underplaying the truculence of what occurred it was despicable you were within every understandable right to feel murderous rage and i know you need that to be legitimized by her to feel as though it were true but your friends knew that those thoughts ran through your head and they backed you up they believed you had a right to feel the way you did
96744 still i wonder if they really knew the intensity of it the truth in my comfort over the idea for the first time in my life i felt empowered enough to kill someone
96745 but you didnt and damn you you did the right thing though even god may not have blamed you for such a minuscule albeit condign indiscretion
96746 its not my place to say what is just and what is not
96747 oh hell come back alright and when he does hell be looking for the same thing he was looking for the first and several times he fucked her
96748 how about some discretion a euphemism here or there would be appreciated
96749 i apologize but there is no word to more properly describe what took place between the two of them as i was saying he will come round again and when he does where will you be a great distance away but a word will travel as far as it needs to when the next incident occurs it may be irreversible
96750 haha i cant tell you that consider it somewhat like job security
96751 you tell me what the hell is going to happen or so help me god ill tear you to pieces where you stand
96752 oh tear me to pieces will you eris come here for a moment dear
96753 why dont you show the man what it is youve kept yourself busy with while you were away from the bar remember that you begged for it
96754 no this isnt foreshadowing youre just torturing me what do you want why are you here what are you doing to me what is your purpose what do you want why are you here what are you doing to me what is your purpose aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh
96755 what have i done ive killed a child an infant

96782 tot nu toe zijn elf lichamen vanonder het puin gehaald
96783 in west europa bedraagt die toename afhankelijk van seizoen iets van een goede n tot anderhalve graad
96784 alleen kunnen we dat niet wetenschappelijk hard maken de klimatologische wetenschap is gewoon nog niet nauwkeurig genoeg we hebben modellen die aantonen dat op wereldniveau landmassa sneller opwarmt dan water en dat het op de noordpool ook hard gaat op kleinere schaal spreken ze elkaar echter tegen
96785 de winters worden sneller zachter omdat we nog amper echt koude continentale oostenwind hebben
96786 de reden daarvoor moet ik weer schuldig blijven het zou kunnen dat dat met veranderende verhoudingen in temperatuur rondom ons te maken heeft dat zou dan weer verband hebben met het broeikaseffect maar dat mag ik in feite niet zeggen want het is speculatie
96787 landen zoals portugal frankrijk en spanje zijn aan het uitdrogen
96788 wij krijgen daardoor niet alleen warmere maar ook minder bewolkte lucht boven ons minder wolken wil zeggen dat zonnestralen makkelijker tot op de aarde raken
96789 we meten hier in de bilt al sinds het midden van de jaren zeventig heel nauwkeurig de hoeveelheid zonnestralen de laatste jaren merken we dat het er meer zijn en dat het aantal stofdeeltjes in de lucht minder is
96790 nou ik vind het wel een lekker weertje zo we kunnen wat meer in de tuin eten nietwaar maar ik neem aan dat als je het aan de boeren vraagt zij iets anders antwoorden ach momenteel is het niet echt problematisch het is bovendien niet gezegd dat deze snellere opwarming zich zal doorzetten op een bepaald moment is de lucht schoon en kan ze niet meer schoner ook de droogte rond de middellandse zee zal een verzadigingspunt bereiken we weten het gewoon nog niet mocht het in dit tempo doorgaan dan zal het op het einde van de eeuw vier acht graden warmer zijn dat is dubbel zoveel als nu vooropgesteld wordt
96791 het is verrassend dat het hier zo snel gaat met de klimaatopwarming
96792 maar ik hecht wel geloof aan het rapport over de cijfers kun je moeilijk discussi ren tot nu toe denk ik dat de meeste mensen baat hebben bij die evolutie de zachtere winters zorgen er vooral voor dat mensen minder energie verbruiken alleen mensen met gezondheidsproblemen kunnen wel last hebben als de hitte enkele dagen na elkaar aanhoudt

96822 harassment has been the order of the day in fact from mid last year we have received several letters from the information department asking us to explain why we published a certain story or feature they even threatened to ban the paper if we continued to write what they claimed to be seditious stories against the president and the state
96823 this police intrusion into the offices of an independent newspaper is disturbing and surprising in a country where the press normally enjoys real freedom
96824 the police have legal powers to search anybody when they believe they have justification anybody not only journalists and newsrooms but even members of parliament can be searched by the police
96825 in a normal constituency people always fall into police hands and are searched in this case it is just because the search concerned journalists and their colleagues publicized the incident but it is nothing new
96826 the government has not banned any newspaper or radio or television station
96827 normalcy has returned and we are in preparation for the second issue since the search

96868 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
96869 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future
96870 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
96871 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
96872 if the administration appeals the ruling our congressional prerogatives will once again be put at risk
96873 we look forward to the white house complying with this ruling and to scheduling future hearings with ms miers and other witnesses who have relied on such claims
96874 we hope that the defendants will accept this decision and expect that we will receive relevant documents and call ms miers to testify in september
96875 i look forward to working with the white house and the justice department to coordinate the long overdue appearances
96876 im sure it will be appealed and it will go on into next year and it will become a moot issue

96901 tu trono dios es eterno y para siempre cetro de justicia es el cetro de tu reino
96902 en el principio la palabra era y la palabra estaba con dios y la palabra era un dios

96908 ve hasta los jud os sab an que l afirmaba ser dios
96909 jes s no era dios los jud os s lo supusieron que jes s estaba afirmando ser dios
96910 oh ya veo entonces aclaremos esto usted concuerda con los fariseos en que jes s no era dios es eso correcto
96911 entonces jehov hizo llover azufre y fuego procedente de jehov desde los cielos sobre sodoma y sobre gomorra
96912 caus un derribo entre ustedes como el derribo de sodoma y gomorra por dios

96923 the exercise will see the redistribution of yet another set of agricultural equipment to farmers
96924 it will also enable the country to ensure that by the year 2010 when we have our tenth phase about 70 80 percent of our farmers would have all the necessary farming equipment
96925 we are still here and waiting for the ids to be processed and once they are ready we will be deployed to various areas in harare and ruwa where we will be operating from
96926 some people might become suspicious but the police would be there to clarify the position
96927 food aid only provides a short term solution to the problem the solution lies in long term investment in agriculture we should be able to produce our own food and not depend on food aid
96928 barriers to trade such as quarantine regulations and tariffs makes it difficult for poor farmers to compete in export markets against highly subsidised farmers
96929 to focus immediately on the current food challenges by increasing agricultural production
96930 encouraging regional collaboration by sustainably improving production capacity and productivity and facilitating cross border and internal food flows based on improved infrastructure and distribution networks
96931 a lot of people are looking for this product because it cuts your commute into seconds
96932 its a very good product for investors too because they can rent out the basement to different people the main floor to different people and the upstairs to different people
96933 it gives executives an alternative to going down to lorne park or southeast oakville because this is in the heartland of mississauga where all the businesses are
96934 theyre all walkouts and in some cases they have extended walkouts where the basements are 10 feet high
96935 it really takes all the guesswork out of buying a home
96936 goldcorp president and chief executive officer said in an interview
96937 this is the area we plan to be in for decades
96938 we expect that the ore that is produced in this area should go through our mill
96939 goldcorp wanted to act aggressively here they did not log their interest with gold eagle saying they wanted to do a deal until after the agnico placement
96940 it is a premier asset in a premier camp with strategic value to goldcorp and we view this bid as inadequate
96941 it didnt make sense for them to start developing a shaft in an area that we thought was the wrong place
96942 weve been looking at ways to get ourselves well positioned into promising parts of that belt that was the only reason for that gold eagle investment
96943 weve always been nibbling around the edges of the red lake camp
96944 if people are going to go around buying chunks of things they know someone else is interested in just to make 25 million thats a different industry than weve been used to
96945 i saw the yellow house and i just had to buy it i planned to come down here and never lift a finger
96946 one point five million was a big listing down here seven years ago
96947 it was shocking shocking he returned to the office and said hed bought a house in picton nobody could believe it
96948 it was the talk of the office for months and then of course we all had to come up and see it
96949 its food wine and the arts its got it all
96950 chuck still has a few signs that he has to change its quite a job
96951 when you have 100 listings in the county and put chestnut park signs on them its instant impact
96952 i can show you houses that ive sold four or five times
96953 well be able to show people properties in all price ranges
96954 generally speaking prices dont have a lot higher to go i dont think youre going to see a run up
96955 even if its not as hot its still a strong market
96956 we want a century house on the water in the county preferably stone
96957 it will be a sophisticated toronto couple who will buy this spectacular waterfront location
96958 people want all done when they move down here they dont want to have to renovate
96959 its not all about the country dream or the waterfront its about having a real life in town
96960 they blamed the shorts whereas as a matter of fact if the prices were inflated they should have blamed the longs for having inflated them
96961 theres so much crap going on at a course from monday to wednesday im just not for it anymore
96962 i just arrive at the last minute play my practice round and get the tournament under way
96963 i got in here lunchtime yesterday and then it rained so i didnt go out on the course at all i know the course well so its not that i really needed a practice round
96964 thats the only fairway i missed i tried to hit it to the fat side of the fairway and i came off it a little bit
96965 he had trousers on was still wearing his shoes and had a big box around his waist
96966 he was just such a logical person we tried to think like he would and figure out where he might go
96967 we would drive past the places wed identified and look for his car
96968 the first show i worked on was a play dry rot by a local amateur company
96969 it was very nice coming to work here because as a youngster i had been a regular in the audience with my mother watching the plays performed by stanley ravenscrofts famous rep theatre company
96970 i must have seen tens of thousands of films over the years i enjoy the new ones but my favourites are still the old ones with gene kelly and cyd charrisse the great musicals
96971 i will miss watching all the films and shows but im planning on staying involved in theatre and cinema in some capacity
96972 the end of pier summer shows dont come here anymore and instead we get a lot of tribute acts
96973 in film today theres a lot more special effects and even in family films i think theres a bit too much bad language
96974 because we use old reels for the cinema and are not digital you have to train someone up
96975 we got a silent film in recently a buster keaton film and idris accompanied it on the piano playing in the dark for 20 minutes
96976 theres a lot of frustration that can come while getting this prepared but when the day comes its all worth it
96977 the festival is very positive its succeeding weve been very successful in our endeavours
96978 if it rains this weekend then the festival may be in a deficit next year its a very thin line and you cant walk that line continually
96979 he had trousers on was still wearing his shoes and had a big box around his waist
96980 theyre doing what they need to do for a formal id
96981 he was just such a logical person we tried to think like he would and figure out where he might go
96982 we would drive past the places wed identified and look for his car

96987 ours is not to question why ours is but to do and die
96988 only a very small percentage of the notebook chips that have shipped are potentially affected and the problem depends on a combination of environmental conditions configuration and usage model
96989 a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors
96990 we feel like weve earned a certain amount of independence
96991 at my school we cant show weapons in a school production not even a stick or do plays with alcohol or sexual references but we want to do theater thats about what its really like being a young person which means not excluding those things
96992 for knowing how to deal with mature subject matter and difficult concepts
96993 its a perfect play for us because its about things young people have to deal with all the time it sounds weird but i can really see myself in wallace
96994 i die daily the making of matthew barneys cremaster cycle
96995 this state sanctioned theft is a vital component of government policy that creates millions of jobs helps control inflation and raises the standard of living for many of the chinese people
96996 here is one typical ghost shift scenario of how such piracy occurs in what has become a global supply chain of piracy and counterfeiting
96997 a factory in china is hired by a multinational to make 1 000 units of a product per day
96998 for much of the second day south africa were blocking their way to victory with appropriately enough for a side sponsored by a brewery a laager mentality
96999 but they now know they will only win this series over andrew flintoffs dead body which may well be the case if england continue to saddle him with the workload of a skegness donkey
97000 it takes great players or men at the top of their form to turn test series around the last time england played south africa they had a full set of trumps marcus trescothick matthew hoggard and steve harmison among them but right now flintoff is carrying this whole team on his back no wonder he was so anxious to make his fiery spell count
97001 we encourage the parents and students to begin looking for financial aid early on not just in their senior year
97002 its just a matter of working individually with the students and of course having the students that meet the criteria for the scholarships
97003 our students under the caring direction of well trained teachers and administrators performed exceptionally well in obtaining scholarships this year
97004 they have set the bar high for next years graduates
97005 in fact its amazing this years graduates have raised the bar for next years seniors and i congratulate them and their parents teachers guidance counselors and school administrators they all have worked hard and they deserve to be applauded
97006 i didnt know fire spread that quickly until i was actually involved in it
97007 it was life threatening we had to run for our lives
97008 i didnt get to do that it was burnt to a crisp
97009 my yearbooks and photo albums i dont have copies of
97010 the firefighters were on the scene and the students were all evacuated from the building at that time of course they were pretty shaken up but luckily no one was hurt
97011 the biggest thing is no injuries thats the biggest goal
97012 were fortunate that there was no serious injury and no loss of life
97013 we are going to work with the students to make sure they have the services they need and their academic endeavors are not interrupted
97014 when you see blue lights behind you theres always a little bit of excitement a fear factor
97015 everybody needs to be more attentive pedestrians and drivers alike
97016 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
97017 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
97018 todds manager david riolo has sent through a response in regards to the clubs proposal and out of good faith the board has agreed to look at this response before a final decision is made on todds future furner said
97019 after the match against the broncos the board will discuss the response and will aim to make a decision on monday
97020 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues
97021 i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world
97022 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
97023 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
97024 by hosting the beijing games we will show the world that the chinese people are a peace loving nation
97025 for a long time china has pursued a military policy that is defensive in nature it will never seek hegemonism chinas development will in no way affect or threaten the interests of others
97026 this investigation is in response to concerns raised by a small number of staff
97027 we have identified around 25 people and they are a myriad of different cancer types
97028 so 25 is not a big number over 2 000 and weve had a diversity of different cancers
97029 we really felt that if staff are concerned about it the only way to address those concerns was to retain some consultants and conduct a proper and thorough investigation so we can give them a high level of comfort that there isnt a problem
97030 i dont believe there really is a cluster here at all but we need to take it seriously
97031 tim macartney snape deceives schools who invite him to talk to students about climbing mt everest by exploiting the occasion to promote jeremy griffith and his teachings
97032 abuses his position of influence derived from his reputation as a mountaineer to recruit students at schools for jeremy smith
97033 it is unsurprising that the impact upon his career as a speaker was dramatic and immediate
97034 the national broadcaster conspired with a religious fundamentalist to do a complete hatchet job on a groundbreaking scientific idea
97035 thirteen years later the truth has caught up with the lie
97036 todays verdict is vindication for a project which has had to endure the appalling and completely unjustified stigma cast by the abc for more than a decade
97037 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
97038 no u s corporation ever made that much in a quarter
97039 but while big oil is making record profits you are paying record prices at the pump and our economy is leaving working people behind
97040 4 billion each year to the oil companies including 1 2 billion for exxon mobil alone
97041 pad oil company profits and save you at best half a tank of gas
97042 all those negative ads hes running wont do a thing to lower your gas prices or lift up the debate in this country
97043 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
97044 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can do is that what this election is really all about is that worthy of the american people
97045 i would take his call now i will take his call when hes president any time remember no matter who is president i dont see this as a political thing i see this as we always have to help no matter what the administration is
97046 he stayed strong stayed extra long til they let all the other boys out now weve got a real man with an american plan were going to put him in the big
97047 i wanted to offer him something that he didnt have a rally song one that really captures that maverick spirit
97048 he was physically tortured for years and yet he gets out of bed every day and serves our country for decades
97049 i dont know somewhere theres a bank and inshallah you will pay for the visas ask the guard i dont know
97050 thomas toomey you take paper to kassa one and pay thomas toomey where are you from thomas toomey how are you like in dushanbe
97051 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
97052 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
97053 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
97054 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
97055 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
97056 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
97057 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
97058 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
97059 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
97060 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
97061 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
97062 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
97063 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
97064 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
97065 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
97066 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
97067 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
97068 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
97069 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
97070 the two most common elements in the universe are hydrogen and stupidity
97071 fifa president sepp blatter criticized valentin ivanovs handling of portugals 1 0 second round win over the netherlands when the russian referee handed out a record tying 16 yellow cards and an unprecedented four reds
97072 i think there could have been a yellow card for the referee
97073 fifa rankings may be used as one of the criteria once the criteria which will take past results into account has been selected it will then be decided what weight will be given to them
97074 obcs constitute 52 of indias population and it is proposed to give them 27 reservation
97075 fine if that necessitates reservation why not do it the other way make x reservation for the so called upper caste or reserve seats for every caste and religion and then for political parties too may be
97076 big idiotic process of helping rich people getting richer leaving the actual poor in distress
97077 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
97078 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
97079 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
97080 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
97081 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
97082 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
97083 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
97084 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
97085 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
97086 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
97087 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
97088 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
97089 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
97090 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
97091 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
97092 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
97093 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
97094 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
97095 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
97096 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
97097 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
97098 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
97099 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
97100 who are open to doing something on the production side
97101 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
97102 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
97103 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
97104 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
97105 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
97106 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
97107 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
97108 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
97109 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
97110 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
97111 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
97112 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
97113 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
97114 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
97115 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
97116 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
97117 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
97118 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
97119 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
97120 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
97121 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
97122 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
97123 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
97124 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
97125 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
97126 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
97127 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
97128 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
97129 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
97130 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
97131 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
97132 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
97133 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
97134 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
97135 the tranquil front porches with rockers or swings bicycle and pedestrian friendly streets quaint lampposts and mature trees of this village exude southern charm
97136 the furnished apartments include four private bedrooms two large bathrooms a kitchen a dinette area a living room and a porch the 452 square foot kitchen dining living areas encourage gatherings outdoor grills and a borrow a bike program which contribute to easy transportation from other parts of campus also spark social calls
97137 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
97138 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
97139 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
97140 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
97141 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
97142 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
97143 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
97144 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
97145 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
97146 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
97147 locking children up is not the answer to youth crime
97148 young people especially those with mental health problems need to be provided with the right assistance to ensure they get better
97149 whilst there has been some investment in mental health services in the youth justice system there needs to be support for parents and their children from the whole spectrum of childrens services
97150 when a child does enter the youth justice system all staff need be trained and aware of mental health problems to help recovery and reduce offending in the long term

97171 it will be a slog for the economy for the next six to 12 months the recession may be over but it wont feel good until this time next year
97172 the basic pattern is clear this is becoming a w shaped recession
97173 will go back to declining after people finish spending their checks
97174 while we expect domestic demand to remain weak going forward stabilizing inventories will likely provide some positive offset in the second half of the year
97175 we have long held that the best measure of the economy most consumers interact with on a daily basis is final sales to domestic purchasers on this basis the economy has actually been weaker than it was in the last recession
97176 people will continue spending the stimulus checks in the third quarter and the fourth quarter that should encourage manufacturers and replenish those stocks
97177 the continued economic downturn that has been prompted by the ongoing mortgage and financial crisis as well as the increase in gasoline and diesel prices
97178 a dramatic reduction in customer traffic and sales during the first half of 2008
97179 the recreational vehicle industry will see a strong turnaround when economic stability returns

97194 these are those things that complete the capabilities of the iraqi security forces and enable them to accomplish their mission
97195 lifting the fear barrier between the iraqi security forces and the people
97196 the iraqi people came together in their neighborhoods and took a stand against terrorists criminals and special groups
97197 the iraqi people rejected those bent on creating anarchy and division amongst them and they became a key factor in the decrease in violence among them in the past year
97198 the enemy is still capable of using high profile attacks as it attempts to incite sectarian violence disrupt iraqs democratic processes and pit iraqis against iraqis
97199 the iraqi people have shown their commitment to securing their cities and neighborhoods
97200 and they are not giving up the security gains that saw ethno sectarian attacks fall by 98 percent in the past 12 months
97201 iron is the single most important micronutrient bacteria need to survive
97202 understanding how these bacteria thrive within us is a critical element of learning how to defeat them
97203 its amazing that the bacteria could learn to extract iron from their environment in this way we went into these experiments with no idea that this mechanism existed but then bacteria have to be creative to survive in some very hostile environments and theyve had maybe 3 5 billion years to figure it out

97210 we have been able to demonstrate that the pattern of carbon dioxide release through decomposition is governed by the same properties everywhere from the arctic circle to tropical rain forests
97211 when their diet is lacking in nitrogen microbes tend to react by releasing more co2 and taking in less mineral nitrogen from the soil so plants can get the much needed mineralised nitrogen earlier in decomposition process from the fallen organic matter
97212 but the 8 million my suspicion is that theyre ordering books that were on the adopted list and ready to be re adopted and order everything my understanding from principals were that they were told to pad their request by 5

97216 were currently looking at adding an additional 18 acres of container yard that would help improve the break bulk area but also container areas so that we can accommodate the volume that is anticipated from both our commercial cargo but also military cargo
97217 that financial model were looking at is what the port could afford itself based on our revenue that were projecting to generate but also were looking to assistance of the federal government because it would impact and accelerate the development of the port to meet their demands
97218 we have signed a memorandum of understanding with the governor and with this administration for us to actually come in and assist the government and the port in what is a very constructive and very positive development and that is to rebuild the port of guam
97219 most importantly to get this thing going to deal with the environmental reviews the environmental reviews and getting the environmental permits can sometimes take years weve done this in other ports and greatly sped up the process
97220 we can actually be the ones that use our procurement system use our vehicles to actually get people on the ground to start construction we do all the paperwork and essentially we then become responsible for the federal funds it just makes things much easier

97282 the scandalous article that was written can become for us a golden opportunity to deepen our faith and love for the lord in the eucharist

97291 but he has never been in a jam like this
97292 tiger at anywhere else in a forest swamp ill pick the tiger to win hands down even in savanna a tiger might win since a lion tires more quickly also the tiger may escape and strike back courtesy more stamina and higher speed
97293 also the tiger may escape and strike back courtesy more stamina and higher speed
97294 skills of ambush attacking tree climbing swimming and predating in swamps
97295 1 two lions may fight for a long time overall but they do so in a series of small fights since they tire quickly tigers being much more territorial would fight with another more intensely and without a break till one concedes defeat
97296 2 contrary to what youve mentioned a lion is not generally a hunter particularly when in a pride
97297 3 as regards speed ive found it from various sources that a bengal tiger averages 45 mph whereas a lion would average 35 mph
97298 4 ambush attacking etc would come into picture for a fight in a thick forest tree climbling may help a tiger escape
97299 5 stamina is of huge importance to a tiger it generally has to carry massive dead prey a long distance amidst thick forest and in maddening humidity
97300 tiger predation on bears tigers generally avoid bears much over 800 lb but will quite readily predate on sub 600 lb females this is impressive predation and during fights with the brown bear the tiger gives quite a good account of itself occasional confrontations with similar weight animals over a kill usually fizzle out after a bit of noise and threatening display huge grizzly bears however the 1000 lb plus bear is king here and of a much more ferocious disposition two large male tigers were found killed by such animals in the year 2000 which is tragic if natures way tigers will usually avoid such a powerful foe but eventually these huge animals will run into each other often the bear is trying to steal the tigers kill the tiger gives a better account of itself in a bear fight than the lion the bear does not go in for strangulation or nape biting but uses his paws to rain blows to the head and shoulders possibly this removes any advantage of a mane with no experience of bear fighting a lion would probably be found wanting against such a foe yet it appears to have great advantage against creatures which go in for blood letting at the throat such as the tiger
97301 i think jesus you dont know tiger powers over bears
97302 bears are slow so they cant attack tiger if it is not near you say about bears weight in a tiger bear fight the bears weight is his disadvantage if you wanna face tiger you should be fast
97303 king of beasts it is worshipped like god in china it has a king sign lions areshit of tigers
97304 seated next to a tiger the lion is composed the tiger on the other hand is usually more nervous and apprehensive the tiger does not seem to have the lions capacity for a calm analysis and appraisal and this puts him at a disadvantage in a fight with a lion
97305 there was a great deal of lion and tiger pit fighting held in korea until 1960 historic reports say the lion was found very difficult to beat again due to the head protection afforded by the mane all reports found to date say the lion usually won
97306 the fight was staged in a caged arena and the tiger is said to have injured the lions hind leg this disabled the animal enough for the tiger to apply a hold to the neck shake the lion and perhaps break the spine the tiger suffered some claw and bite marks but the tiger had seemingly gained the advantage from having administered the leg injury
97307 the first fight took place in a pit with the entire encounter being recorded
97308 the film showed the tiger was at an immediate disadvantage tigers use throat grip as their primary means of killing and the lions thick protective mane prevented the tiger gaining a hold on the throat joint on the other hand the tiger had no special protection so it was vulnerable to attack
97309 tigers claws and canines and even jaw power can over power bear
97310 amur tigers in particular outweigh lions by approximately 20 on average
97311 3 this observation was confirmed more recently in the 1950 s by a keeper in the bronx zoo where a lion cub named zambezi and a young tiger named ranee were raised together
97312 what encounters have you read angel fire sites made up lairwebs tripods provide a real source

97317 she started slinking around the house as if terrified sniffing everywhere and growling low it was as if she was convinced she was going to die
97318 tovarisch continued to sniff at the fur eyeing me closely as if for an explanation when none was forthcoming he too began to sniff around growling ears back neither one of them would come near the fur and if i brought it towards them they would bark or growl slinking backwards in absolute defense position
97319 after awhile ilka got curious again and would come forward to sniff at it then would dash away
97320 she wouldnt even go near the fur thats how scared she was
97321 seen enough fights to conclude that none of the theories is accurate sometimes a lion would win sometimes a tiger
97322 lions are the troublemakers the most dangerous when the public sees the cats they always think the tiger is the worst because a tiger looks bad he looks sneaky but the male lion of the big cats is the worst the male lion has a pride hes in charge of a group of females until another male lion runs him off it could be its own son but the female lion is under domination she may make the kill the male lion comes down to eat and then the females can eat it doesnt work that way in humans but it does work that way in animals
97323 it was an amazing performance since my entire entourage consisted of big young powerful animals so these were not pushovers that sultan defeated this remarkable lion feinting like a clever boxer and making his opponents miss would then send the off balance enemy sprawling across the arena with a tremendous clout

97325 a captive bengal tigress is throw into a manmade pit with a captive male lion with cameraman and cameras set up everywhere to film every angle from every side of the fight the tigress proceeds to kill the male lion in the fight there are many wildfights filmed of the 2 beasts fighting however this is not one the male lion was killed in this fight
97326 this yes is the gir forest fight the full thing is 16mm alot of you all may have seen the prank shown much like the big cage lie where the tigress almost kills the male lion and reports real reports say the lion went on to die in the gir forest the whole thing is 9 minutes long in length the tigress does not die in anyway shape or form the tigress pushes off the male lion as the video gos on she then starts resting after she pushes the male lion off of her the tigress is alive alert and well the tigress is barely injured the tigress pushed the male lion off with her paw the lion backs off the tigress proceeds to circle 2 twice and drop to the ground tired and exhausted the male lion is now backed off of her they then pull her out of the pit while she alive and moving an also make no mistake about it this is a pit fight an the lairwebs link is completely inaccurate and full of false biased and misleading information the tigress actually about kills the lion in the big cage an by no shape or form does the tigress even get seriously injured in the gir forest fight yes there are 2 wild fights that due exist in stock footage i can tell you that but by no means has a lion ever killed a tigress or tiger on film but a tiger has killed a lion 3 times i might add

97329 1963 publication somehow vouches for tigers superiority unclear if it is discussing an actual incident or merely a theory
97330 it was an amazing performance since my entire entourage consisted of big young powerful animals so these were not pushovers that sultan defeated this remarkable lion feinting like a clever boxer and making his opponents miss would then send the off balance enemy sprawling across the arena with a tremendous clout
97331 anyway i would just ignore any person like this because their just so biast its humorious

97333 because i know so much on lions and tigers i agree but the discovery channel made the fight seem much closer than it was to make it more enticing
97334 although lions and tigers are anatomically virtually the same male lions regularly fight to attain and maintain pride females such fighting is often to the death tigers fight but rarely to the death
97335 i suspect that male lions on average would be more aggressive and persistent than male tigers hence would prevail
97336 it was inappropriate though it was some old footage where they threw a tiger and a lion into a pit the lion was more dominant while the tiger just gave up none of the cats were interested in finishing the other off

97340 when the ancient romans set tiger against lion in the coliseum the tiger invariably won the living edens
97341 the lion is a less active animal than the tiger and apparently not so powerful in every case of a fight between the two in a menagerie the tiger has invariably killed his opponent
97342 in fights between a tiger and a lion in the wild the tiger is usually the winner

97526 the tiger does not seem to have the lions capacity for calm analysis and appraisal this puts him at a disadvantage in a fight with a lion
97527 just when the tiger has the advantage in the beginning in the end they loose it
97528 he had no possible hope of separating the big cats and the lion went on to maul the tiger to death

97573 the heaviest bengal tiger ever reported was 389 5 kg and measured 320 cm between shoulders this tiger was shot in uttar pradesh northern india in 1967 by david hasinger and is the heaviest tiger with reliable source however according to mazak the occurrence of those exceptional large tigers is debatable and not confirmed via reliable references
97574 according to mazak none of these cases were confirmed via reliable sources
97575 maurice you state that my sources aren t reliable yet nearly every source you give state that those measurements weren t confirmed which is exactly what i said
97576 their weight ranges from 180 to 270 kilograms 400 594 pounds

97584 over curves and i did not want to say that there is no possibility for the existence of even larger bengal tigers than 570 lb 258 kg but according to mazak this is the heaviest which is confirmed via reliable sources
97585 if tigers weighed anywhere near the 500 lbs you claim then that tiger would have been extremely underweight
97586 while a source i visited said a captive lion weighed 930 lbs
97587 these were all from reliable sorces based on studies done by zoologits
97588 lions are a better fighter so lets move on now
97589 a tiger is nothing more than a fat leopard wearing a different coat
97590 there is a lot more to biting and feeding ecology that brute jaw force
97591 lions for example have scissor like teeth while those of an alligator are blunt and pointed the greatest canine force of all animals belongs to the lion
97592 lion has no equal when it comes to fighting skills tigers are great hunter but they lack the ferocity of a lion and the tenacity to dominate
97593 lions forelimbs is the strongest of all cats capable of breaking a zebras back

97601 they are 400lbs in warm weather and up to 650lbs in cold weather
97602 although male siberian tigers commonly weigh up to 270 kilograms 595lbs 3 an average male weighs around 200 230 kg 440 507lbs
97603 in the wild lions learn not to bite each other on the mane instead they go for the limbs skull and underbelly

97605 the bengal skull is 28 33cm lion skull is 36 39cm siberian skull is 38 42cm
97606 the lions mane saved his neck and head from being much injured but the tiger at last succeeded in ripping up his belly and in a few minutes he was dead
97607 the lions mane saved his neck and head from being much injured
97608 the mane of the lion forms a good defense against the attacks of rival lions the one danger to which he is liable for the males as sir a smith informs me engage in terrible battles and a young lion dares not approach an old one
97609 it is only expert claim that states tigers are bigger and i doubt this statement was based on concrete evidence but based more on outlandish estimates made by hunters
97610 lions and tigers are the same size if tigers were bigger on average they would have much less agility due to a decrease in muscle mass as muscle doesn t increase as rapidly as an animal grows and it s literally impossible to have a muscle mass over 60 at a weight above 416 lbs which happens to be the average weight of a lion
97611 and my videos are proof and those were both male animals fighting it was an african lion and bengal tiger however most people post videos which are edited to look like the tiger wins but never show a dead or fleaing lion but my videos show the tigers as dead or dying
97612 on my top video you can easily see that the koreans used old lions and some could hardly walk straight but that wasn t the whole video and the lion usually won most of the time
97613 lions usually won battles between the two cats that were arranged by the romans anyone who says different doesn t know the facts and probably came to that conclusion from some tiger expert lions will win 7 10 times
97614 muscle doesn t increase as rapidly as an animal grows and it s literally impossible to have a muscle mass over 60 at a weight above 416 lbs which happens to be the average weight of a lion
97615 male bengal tigers measure around 275 290 cm sometimes up to 305 cm with their tail the tail of a large male is usually 85 95 cm long their weight is normally around 200 220 kilograms 440 485 pounds the heaviest bengal tiger with confirmed weight was 258 kg 568 79 lbs and was shot in northern india in 1938 females are considerably smaller and have an average weight of 100 130 kg 220 287 lbs and reach seldom more than 160 kg
97616 male bengal tigers measure 275 310 cm 2 sometimes up to 360 cm citation needed with their tail the tail of a large male is usually 85 95 cm long their weight ranges from 180 to 270 kilograms 400 594 pounds with an average weight of 200 236 kg 440 520 lb 2 the heaviest bengal tiger ever reported was 389 5 kg and measured 320 cm between shoulders this tiger was shot in uttar pradesh northern india in 1967 by david hasinger and is the heaviest tiger with reliable source citation needed however according to mazak the occurrence of those exceptional large tigers is debatable and not confirmed via reliable references 2 females are considerably smaller and have an average weight of 141 kg 310 lb but they can reach up to 180 kg 3 400 lb
97617 the african lion can range from 35 98 in 90 250 cm in length plus an additional 39 in 100 cm for the tail the length ranges from the smallest for females to the largest for males they are 48 in 122 cm high at the shoulder lions weigh on average 570 lb 260 kg for the males and 277 lb 126 kg for the females lions rarely exceed 500 pounds the largest recorded was 690 lb 312 kg there is a marked sexual dimorphism in this species besides the obvious difference of male lions having manes of fur around their heads female lions called lionesses are generally about 40 smaller african lions in the serengeti plains tend to be much smaller than those in the transvaal

97619 that last site you gave was posted by some tiger fan i saw it on another website it s completely false

97621 damon you are saying me scientists are not serious and tell bullshits do you know what is a scientist all scientists work on facts
97622 in a fight between a lion and a tiger who would win
97623 lions are the troublemakers the most dangerous when the public sees the cats they always think the tiger is the worst because a tiger looks bad he looks sneaky but the male lion of the big cats is the worst the male lion has a pride hes in charge of a group of females until another male lion runs him off it could be its own son but the female lion is under domination she may make the kill the male lion comes down to eat and then the females can eat it doesnt work that way in humans but it does work that way in animals
97624 i can cite a few instances of male tigers whipping male lions but i cant think of one such case where the tiger didnt have a distinct advantage i also recall a case where a tiger had a marked advantage and lost the fight the lion seems to have no fear of the tiger seated next to a tiger the lion is composed the tiger on the other hand is usually nervous and apprehensive the tiger does not seem to have the lions capacity for calm analysis and appraisal this puts him at a disadvantage in a fight with a lion
97625 it was an amazing performance since my entire entourage consisted of big young powerful animals so these were not pushovers that sultan defeated this remarkable lion feinting like a clever boxer and making his opponents miss would then send the off balance enemy sprawling across the arena with a tremendous clout
97626 weighed by meinertzhagen 1938 14 males from 150 kg to 180 kg mean 172 kg four males weighed 167 171 176 and 184 kg respectively wilson 1968
97627 his weight must therefore be about 350 pounds fairly average for a serengeti male
97628 to be fair i have something about tigers and in one instance a siberian tiger was mentioned that weighed 445 lbs lions commonly weigh up to 440 lbs and even up to 570lbs it proves that tigers are no bigger than lions
97629 also the ancient romans used to hold pit fights between lions and siberian and they were beaten almost every time due mostly to their less aggressive nature and unwillingness to fight
97630 they used captive siberian tigers for those ancient fights with lions and the lions won almost every time
97631 the amur or siberian tiger is the largest and heaviest subspecies of tiger making them

97633 the lion is the second largest member of the cat family only the tiger is larger
97634 the second largest feline predator the lion once ranged from greece to india and in much of africa
97635 a lot of the habitat would be ok the skeletons pretty much the same as the lion only a little larger
97636 the tiger 100 pounds heavier than the lion is the uncontested super cat
97637 while the mane question remains unsolved patterson believes he has dispelled other popular ideas about the lions that they are bigger or possibly a separate species or subspecies of african lion charting the skull size of 18 tsavo lions he found that they ranged from more than 11 inches to nearly 15 inches well within the range of lions elsewhere on the continent and an analysis of the lions dna revealed that their genetic make up is virtually identical to that of panthera leo throughout africa

97644 the dry skull method may underestimate maximum bite force at the canine cbs by a factor ranging between 1 3 and 1 5 more posteriorly within the jaw this discrepancy increases and may exceed a factor of two thomason 1991 consistent with this finding we found that bs at the carnassial in a spotted hyaena was around half that given as an absolute maximum from empirical data binder amp van valkenburgh 2000
97645 a large tortoise is killed and eaten i presume it is seatao a sub adult tiger 18 or 19 months old see 1b as shadows jaws would not be strong enough i have seen lions struggle to crush tortoises of a much smaller size
97646 a different kind of protection is achieved by the tortoises which grow up to about eighteen inches in length i have watched a group of lions trying to bite into the shell of a tortoise of about half that size without success
97647 lions are tidy killers not quick ones since a lions teeth are neither long enough nor strong enough to bite through the thick muscles and massive vertebrae on the back of the neck of a large animal the throat hold is an eminently sensible solution
97648 tigers therefore cannot be bigger on average as this could hamper it s speed and agility something which is crutial to a lone hunter
97649 a fully developed male lion can grow up to 10 feet in body length and is surpassed in size only by the larger species of tiger
97650 now as a short summary of what i discussed a comparison of the averages weight lion 185 5 kg tiger 219 27 kg
97651 because a tiger hunts alone bobby gibbs told me every weapon its got has to be deadly efficient
97652 theres no arguing that tigers are the current largest cat
97653 one zoologist whose name i forgot mentioned about tigers having brown fat this fat is very similar to polar and grizzly bears this is more true for siberian than for bengal though this is one of the main reason why tigers are capable of gaining weight easily than lions except ofcourse if you put lions in cool temperature they too can gain weight
97654 when the safari spectators see a fight between the lion and the tiger cumulating they reveal a big interest when the time comes the real image inside the safari is disappointing the lion is actually stronger
97655 now i consider myselt truely knowledgeable on anything dealing with lions or tigers even more so then most zoologists in some aspects
97656 some sites even now still state that tigers are taller than lions if so then they should by rights be slower

97677 description easily recognizable as the only striped cat the tiger is the largest of the living felids reliable weight data are difficult to find however because hunters typically measured total length tail length and shoulder heaight but rarely carried scales the heaviest bengal tiger on record was a male that weighed 258 2 kilograms this weight is not unlikely as an exceptionally large male tiger captured during studies in nepal bottomed out a scale with a capacity of 227 kilograms
97678 patterson believes he has dispelled other popular ideas about the lions that they are bigger or possibly a separate species or subspecies of african lion
97679 when the ancient romans set tiger against lion in the coliseum the tiger invariably won in some ways the tiger is the ultimate predator
97680 it was the tigers fight and he knew it he sprang at the staggering lion took a fearful chop on the nose without flinching and set his teeth in to the africans bary throat they wrestled desperately and the lions heavy mane saved him from suffocation great mouthfulls of long cosrse hair catching in the tigers teeth not only preventing him from getting a death grip but so interfered with his with his respiration that he had to release the hold whereupon the lion swatted him with a tremendous uppercut and snt him tumbling twenty feet away it was evidently nearing the finish despite the rallying power and the indoubtable couarge of the lion he could hardly turn to follow the motions of the tiger and the striped fellow still strong upon his legs was again moving snake like around his victim the tiger darted and the lion missed clean with both claws over they went the tiger worked fore and hind paws frantically and in less than fourty seconds had ripped the lions body fairly into shreds atlas with one last effort threw the tiger off strove to roar fell prostrate on the sand and died
97681 lion against tiger an extraordinary combat in which the king of the beasts was vanquished in a battle to the death
97682 the male siberian or amur tiger with a total body length in excess of 10 ft and weighing up to 300 kg is by far the largest and most powerful member of the cat family
97683 adult elephants are too dangerous to tigers to serve as common prey but conflicts between elephants and tigers do sometimes take place a case where a tiger killed an adult female indian rhino has been observed they have been reported to carry domestic livestock weighing 50 kg 110 lb while easily jumping over fences 2 m 6 ft 6 in high their heavily muscled forelimbs are used to hold tightly onto the prey and to avoid being dislodged especially by large prey such as gaurs gaurs and water buffalos weighing over a ton have been killed by tigers weighing about a sixth as much tigers may kill such formidable predators as leopards pythons and even crocodiles on occasion although predators typically avoid one another tigers have been known to suppress wolf populations in areas where the two species coexist dhole packs have been observed to attack and kill tigers in disputes over food though not usually without heavy losses siberian tigers and brown bears can be competitors and usually avoid confrotation however tigers will kill bear cubs and even some adults on occasion bears asiatic black bears and brown bears make up 5 8 of the tigers diet in the russian far east some bears emerging from hibernation will seek out tigers to steal their kills tigers will usually defend their kills as long as the bear is not a large male sloth bears are quite aggressive and will sometimes drive tigers away from their kills in some cases bengal tigers prey on sloth bears
97684 average bite force for a lion will be around 750 lbs and when measured from a young lion was around 691 lbs a tiger s bite force would be between 550 700 lbs depending on wether it s male or female
97685 down sprang caesar determined to seize the offensive but before he could do so bobby had battled his way through caesars paws grabbed his mane so stubbornly that he couldnt move for the next couple of minutes each struggled and strained for an advantage but bobbys hold was so tenacious that they only succeeded in twisting a little with the cameras continuing to grind and getting nothing but a little harmless tug of war energy spent the exhausted bobby tried to roll away from caesar but caesars hold now was as firm as bobbys which had been on his mane seeing this turn in affairs i dashed into the cage already caesars jaws had crunched bobbys neck and when i got there caesar was shaking bobbys limp bloody head and throat from side to side bobbys eyes were turning starey he was dead and it was only two minutes since i had dashed the ammonia into his face i was keenly sorry that i had done it but in thinking it over i became convinced that my part had been negligible the lion is frequently the superior he doubtless would have been the winner in this case no matter what i had done
97686 she is like a clever boxer against a heavy hitter shrewder and trickier
97687 world renowed lion expert craig packer not knowing his decision i asked him who he favored and to my suprise the biggest lion expert in the world favors the tiger
97688 the streets of rome had seen more tigers then any hunter on the ganges
97689 clyde beatty actually says he knows of cases of tigers fighting off several lions at once and emerging from the fight unharmed one sumatran tiger named chester fought off seven lions at once and only incurred slight injuries clyde beatty tiger fought off seven different lions therefore it is equal to seven accounts 86 the bengal tiger rex was apparently also more than a match for lions that attacked him even when he was outnumbered
97690 well in most cases the tiger usually comes out the winner
97691 definately myth i would question the credibility of anyone with such an accusation
97692 northern bengal tigers would take a lion with freakish purportions and fighting ability to beat these beasts
97693 the wrong cat is being called the king of the beasts
97694 the biggest lions and tigers are the same size yet people still seem to think tigers are bigger how so
97695 they say it weighs about 930lbs the same amount as the heaviest captive tiger on record that should be proof as to the size of both animals
97696 the guinness book of world records lists the heaviest tiger as being a 1 025 pound male amur
97697 so with the average weight lower than that of northern bengal tiger and the largest wild siberian tiger 40 kg less than the largest recorded northern bengal tiger and far fewer records of authenticated large siberian tigers found than the northern bengal tiger the story ends
97698 clyde beatty actually says he knows of cases of tigers fighting off several lions at once and emerging from the fight unharmed one sumatran tiger named chester fought off seven lions at once and only incurred slight injuries clyde beatty tiger fought off seven different lions therefore it is equal to seven accounts 86 the bengal tiger rex was apparently also more than a match for lions that attacked him even when he was outnumbered
97699 in a fight between a lion and a tiger who would win
97700 lions are the troublemakers the most dangerous when the public sees the cats they always think the tiger is the worst because a tiger looks bad he looks sneaky but the male lion of the big cats is the worst the male lion has a pride hes in charge of a group of females until another male lion runs him off it could be its own son but the female lion is under domination she may make the kill the male lion comes down to eat and then the females can eat it doesnt work that way in humans but it does work that way in animals
97701 i can cite a few instances of male tigers whipping male lions but i cant think of one such case where the tiger didnt have a distinct advantage i also recall a case where a tiger had a marked advantage and lost the fight the lion seems to have no fear of the tiger seated next to a tiger the lion is composed the tiger on the other hand is usually nervous and apprehensive the tiger does not seem to have the lions capacity for calm analysis and appraisal this puts him at a disadvantage in a fight with a lion
97702 it was an amazing performance since my entire entourage consisted of big young powerful animals so these were not pushovers that sultan defeated this remarkable lion feinting like a clever boxer and making his opponents miss would then send the off balance enemy sprawling across the arena with a tremendous clout
97703 the lion is a 500lbs pure muscle there bodies are built for the fight
97704 why they so muscular because they have 4 things going for them fighting which expends most of their energy and muscles sleep which allows for recuperation eating and having sex
97705 lions have the highest testarone level which explains for their extreme aggressiveness
97706 lions are the king of all predators when in battle no matches their brute aggression and fierceness
97707 male lion are capable of speed from 0 50mph in 2 sec
97708 a hunter shattered a lions shoulder and amazingly the lion charges at 50mph

97752 lions have on occasion encountered brown bears usually in captive situations lions and brown bears were pitted against each other in the colosseum of ancient rome where the bears almost invariably dominated the lions on a one to one basis a more recent conflict occurred in late 19th century california with similairly one sided results
97753 siberian tigers and brown bears can be competitors and usually avoid confrotation however tigers will kill bear cubs and even some adults on occasion bears asiatic black bears and brown bears make up 5 8 of the tigers diet in the russian far east even dangerous animals like adult brown bears are among the prey species of the siberian tiger asiatic black bears and brown bears constitute 5 8 of the siberian tigers diet though tigers generally avoid bears weighing above 800 lb but will quite readily predate on females below 600 lb certain tigers have been reported to imitate the calls of asiatic black bears to attract them
97754 in a match of animals of equal weight and age i think a lion has an advantage because of his nature fighting skills etc
97755 the tiger had landed three blows to the lions one but the lion s swings evidently had much more force in them for the gashes in the tigers hide were deeper and apparently the more enfeebling the tiger slunk away and hugged the wall trying to regain his wind while atlas roaring furiously stood his ground in the centre the blood dripping from twenty ugly wounds
97756 down sprang caesar determined to seize the offensive but before he could do so bobby had batted his way through caesars paws grabbed his mane in his jaws and taken it in a firm unyielding grip but bobbys hold was so tenacious so i sprang in with a bottle of ammonia dashed a little in bobbys face
97757 down sprang caesar determined to seize the offensive but before he could do so bobby had battled his way through caesars paws grabbed his mane so stubbornly that he couldnt move for the next couple of minutes each struggled and strained for an advantage but bobbys hold was so tenacious that they only succeeded in twisting a little with the cameras continuing to grind and getting nothing but a little harmless tug of war energy spent the exhausted bobby tried to roll away from caesar but caesars hold now was as firm as bobbys which had been on his mane seeing this turn in affairs i dashed into the cage already caesars jaws had crunched bobbys neck and when i got there caesar was shaking bobbys limp bloody head and throat from side to side bobbys eyes were turning starey he was dead and it was only two minutes since i had dashed the ammonia into his face i was keenly sorry that i had done it but in thinking it over i became convinced that my part had been negligible the lion is frequently the superior he doubtless would have been the winner in this case no matter what i had done
97758 would require a muscle mass higher than 60 which nature tells us is impossible at such high weights
97759 it s common knowledge that bears are stronger than lions or tigers
97760 most people even experts are often misguided by other often less informed individuals who base their knowledge on stories by hunters who claim sitings of huge tigers

97766 the averag man can deadlift 250 lbs and leopards average 125 lbs in weight a number which is 1 10th the amount that 5 adult humans can lift as i ve said before the number 10 often factors into a lot of equations and the case is obviously true here
97767 i base my claims on things i know to be true
97768 i base the knowledge that both lions and tigers average 416 lbs by determining the amount of muscle mass either posseses also seeing as both big cats have about 600 muscles in their bodies a muscle mass over 60 is an impossibity for either species without causing some serious health problems at such weights higher percentages in muscle mass is dangerous because an animal of that size can t function without some serious health issues as the heart must work overtime to supply oxygen to those huge muscles possibly causing a failure in other body systems
97769 sumatran tigers have 63 378 muscle mass you cant prove me wrong
97770 name one animal that s stronger than a lion that don t outweigh the animal
97771 a tiger s spine is 15 longer than a lion s while a lion is 15 taller on average so the size difference evens out a lion s tail and neck are longer so overall body length is the same for either cat

97782 victor was on a hunt in africa with professional hunter frikkie dotouit a call came into the main camp that two lions had killed livestock near one of the tracker huts at daylight victor and frikkie were on the tracks of two adult males one very large after about a mile the tracks split they took the larger set of tracks until they lost them in tall grass and thorn bush frikkie called in reinforcements and soon five hounds arrived the hounds quickly caught the scent and found the lion who was quickly up and running after a few hundred yards the lion crouched and growled at the circling hounds victor and frikkie were working their way into shooting range when the lion let out a bass drum roar that made victors chest vibrate the lion sprang to his feet looking directly at them he then dashed out in front of the hounds again and was on the run the thick grass and thorn bush gave way to a more open park area once in the open the lion in huge bounds cleared the brush and headed for a thorn tree in a very unusual move the lion attempted to leap into the tree breaking the first branch and tumbling back down he quickly leapt back up into the tree like an alley cat climbing to the top of the tree causing the tree to sway like a slinky victor was in the direct sunshine the lion in the shade of the tree in a quartered position the wind was blowing the leaves casting shimmering shadows on the lions tawny hide victor focused on the mane and the outer perimeter and followed it down to the heart area letting the arrow fly victor got off a perfect heart shot the lion slumped and died in the tree within seconds victors lion weighed in at 650 lbs and was 10 feet long his official score is 26 and 14 16 and he is the new 1 world record with a bow

97784 when the ancient romans set tiger against lion in the coliseum the tiger invariably won in some ways the tiger is the ultimate predator
97785 george stubbs the most famous and original animal painter of his time who was just reaching his peak in 1759 liked to display combats of lion versus tiger though he did not commit the egregious mistake made in james wardas animal pictures painted later in the century where the lion symbolizes britain and the tiger india in reality as we know very clearly from the obscene animal fights staged by the ancient romans in the arena the tiger would win in such a sight every time
97786 i have seen that last video is it a male tiger or tigress vs lioness
97787 the fight is way brutal im not picking sides lion chasing after the tiger to give tiger a throat bite and finish him off it wasnt like lion was protecting its young he wanted to kill the tiger thats all from the videos we see
97788 normal northern tigers will not get to over 600 lbs perhaps a freak tiger would the reason is very simple out of 7 tigers studied in chitwan and 3 in nagarahole none was 600 lb out of 25 tigers in a study of assam and neighboring regions none was over 600 lbs thats a total of 35 male tigers from north 600 lbs is not a normal weight but a freak tiger also we have a lion scientifically verified and mentioned in scientific journal that was 272 kg 598 lbs if that lion reached that weight there are probably other freak lions with that weight too madla male bengal tiger was weighed and was around 250 kg 550 lbs
97789 maurice what you said about tigers weighing more in the past doesn t even make sense

97808 lions have been known to drag a carcass weighing up to 1000 lbs a distance of up to 400 feet
97809 tigers being of a shorter profile naturally appear larger due to a more compact build
97810 its not the size of the man that wins the fight its the fight within the man
97811 tigers being of a shorter profile naturally appear larger due to a more compact build
97812 pulling a 1000 lb carcass 400 feet is an average i couldn t find the link that presented that message
97813 that isn t to say that this is likely the maximum it can drag
97814 i deduced that since lions average somewhere in the 400 lb range this is likely the highest distance that carcass is able to be pulled by the lion
97815 i meant that the tiger posseses a relatively smaller body
97816 that isnt to say that this is likely the maximum it can drag
97817 this is likely the highest distance that carcass is able to be pulled by the lion
97818 for every weight pulled 1 4th the amount of muscle is needed to pull it because it is easier to pull than to lift
97819 secondly as muscle only increases 1 4th as rapily as size this seems to be a likely figure
97820 so damon first you claimed that you deduced the average weight from the distance dragged now youre saying you deduced the distance dragged from the average weight wonderful
97821 you simply take the first 2 digits of the distance pulled add 10 which is then 60 then use that percentage to come up with the answer
97822 the power of the lion is in its forelimb while the tiger is in its hind legs
97823 this is some excerpt from tiger moon written by mel amp fiona sunquist
97824 the longest accurately measured bt bengal tiger recorded in 1907 stretched 10 ft 7in or 3
97825 according to jon who is involved with domestic tigers and lions and other big cats that lions and tigers that live in the same environment fed the same amount of food tend to be the same in weight
97826 the power of the lion is in its forelimb while the tiger is in its hind legs
97827 you should know that both lions and tigers have a fat content of less than 5
97828 in indian zoos captive bred male pure bengals usually weigh about 400lbs but their measurements are about the same as our male siberian but our male siberian weighs about 500lbs the reason i know about the weights and measurements of the bengals in indian zoos is because somebody i used to work with did a study on bengals in indian zoos she contacted many zoos in india that held studbook bengals and asked them if they had weighed their tigers she was able to find out the weights of 19 male bengals the heaviest male she found was 436lbs and the lightest was 382lbs and most of them was around 400lbs as for his wild tigers of nepal the largest recently verified is only 261 kg all other are guesses or 40 year old myths
97829 also the bible says that the lion is the mightiest among all beasts now cmon you maniacs can the bible be wrong
97830 do not think that you know everything about them just because youve seen many videos on you tube
97831 in any case the average weights recorded by the project seem to be lower than those noted in the past at least one authority suspects this is the difference between real weights and hunter s estimates pointing out that tigers live perhaps fifteen years in the wild and twenty or more in captivity and ordinarily keep growing all their lives and that therefore truely enormous males occasionaly appear amoung all the big cats including jaguars and mountain lions
97832 i stood rooted to the ground they roth and barnes talked about the tigers getting the lions but what about me
97833 bring the tigers in first boys then the two lions and watch those tigers mabel if they get my lions it will ruin my number
97834 you would think that the lions were the trouble makers but no it was the tigers
97835 the lions are calm and collective the tigers are nervous around the lions
97836 muscle mass the findings of this study extend and strengthen the results of previous studies that report that men have more appendicular muscle than women as estimated by duel energy x ray absorptiometry dexa 20 21 and with a single ct image 31 our findings indicate that there are gender differences for regional and whole body muscle mass on average sm mass in men was 36 greater than in women this gender difference remained after controlling for gender differences in body weight and height because sm mass relative to body weight was 38 in men and only 31 in women given the strong influence sm has on bone mineral density 6 39 the increased prevalence of osteoporosis in women may be explained in part by their lower sm mass these findings highlight the importance of weight bearing and or resistance exercise in women for building and maintaining muscle mass strength and bone mineral density
97837 this is reasonable given that taller subjects have longer bones and muscles and would be expected to have a greater muscle mass similarly heavier subjects require greater muscle mass for movement and would be expected to have more muscle than their lean counterparts although we observed a linear relationship between muscle mass and height the relationship between muscle mass and body mass was curvilinear the larger the increase in body weight the smaller the relative contribution of sm to the weight gain the curvilinear relationship between muscle mass and body mass in our study is similar to the relationship observed between lean body mass and body weight 17 lean body mass rises with increased degrees of obesity however the heavier the individual the smaller the relative contribution of lean body mass to the weight gain 17 18
97838 we only know what we have seen as far as captive cats i think it is very close as to the weights of the cats and as for which species is stronger that is also close to call
97839 it is the lion that always makes the first attack and it is he who gets the worst of it
97840 lions are the troublemakers the most dangerous when the public sees the cats they always think the tiger is the worst because a tiger looks bad he looks sneaky but the male lion of the big cats is the worst
97841 then he and another tiger pounced upon her and lay on top of her biting the woman with their yellow teeth and slapping her with huge limber paws that left two inch grooves on her arms and bloody ruts across her face almost before the people in the audience had time to scream the lion tamer came over from the next ring and rescued the lady from the tigers

97844 sri lanka was named after a lion their hindu gods have lions at their footstool this signify power
97845 average man has a muscle mass of 40 or 60 lbs of muscle
97846 lions who evolved for a relatively different task has 250 lbs of muscle a little less than 10 times the amount a human has
97847 maurice actually india used to hold lions in a much higher esteem because it is extinct in asia for nearly a millenium the tiger replaced its positon like i said indias island sri lanka was named after a lion their hindu gods have lions at their footstool this signify power and virtue

97849 again refer to 1490 tigers replaced lions because they literally disappeared from that country today only 300 lions exist in india gir forest and it is heavily protected by the government
97850 we only know what we have seen as far s captive cats i think it is very close as to the weights of the cats and as for which species is stronger that is also close to call
97851 it would be hard as to be fair we would have to use cats the same age and in the same health our guys are all old but we will give it some thought as to what kind of test we can do also out here tigers out number the lions so they have the majority rules mentality bcr
97852 like i said indias island sri lanka was named after a lion
97853 i googled sri lankan images and this is what i found in that country today
97854 the sea claimed an ancient capital of india now it has given it back
97855 history has it that sri lanka was known as the pearl island of india

97857 for over 50 years the scene was thought by viewers to be a well staged dramatic scene but is now recognised as a documentary showing an actual killing
97858 however data collected from 1985 to 1995 has revealed that tiger predation is the second largest threat to the rhino population after poaching in the 11 year period 178 rhinos were killed by tigers in the park 149 83 7 percent of them calves
97859 lions were born fighters and are much more aggressive than tigers
97860 by the way nice touch on the history lesson eventhough i find it useless our discussion here is still lion vs tiger

97866 maurice and your point is dave salmoni just did tigers week for the discovery channel he has a show called living with tigers on top of that he happens to be a zoologist and a big cat trainer so there you go try anabel maxine too shes a tiger lover and have worked closely with them but even she said that tigers are no match for lions
97867 lions are more likely to hunt together to kill larger animals such as zebras and buffalo and usually hunt alone to kill smaller prey such as warthogs in either case other lions that did not help with the kill still move in to share the food
97868 tigers hunt alone primarily between dusk and dawn traveling 10 to 30 km 6 to 20 mi in a night in search of prey they specialize in killing wild boar and other swine and medium to large deer such as red deer chital and sambar in india and nepal tigers hunt gaur a huge wild cattle weighing up to 1 000 kg 2 200 lb tigers go out of their way to kill the largest prey available and only adult asian elephants and greater one horned rhinoceros are safe from tigers although tigers do kill rhinoceros and elephant calves
97869 you can get yourself out of a fight he means lions by bowing your head and body down a tiger is unpredictable you dont know if theyre backing down or not
97870 when tigers fight it is an unbelievable sight there is nothing like it they rip everything apart they rip the flesh right up from the bone leaving almost no skin behind regardless of whether they are attacking a man or another animal
97871 training tigers and elephants to work together was much more difficult and much more dangerous than working with lions and elephants
97872 congo an african note never made a big deal about working with the tiger i believe they react this way because there are no tigers to fear in africa but in india elephants and tigers share the same habitat so fear of the tiger is in the indian elephants genes

97878 there are no greater scrappers than tigers but they avoid fights whereas the lion instinctively starts a fight or joins the nearest one the tigers had hardly touched the floor of the arena to perform for note when the lions every single one in the act were after them each lion was making a lunge for the nearest tiger

97884 the average lion also is a little bigger and heavier than the average tiger i wouldnt do much frenzied betting on a fight between a lion and a tiger of the same age and weight that would be foolish

97901 bob wall but you know bruce was one of those rare people who worked extremely hard to the most of anyones imagination
97902 answered question subject lions and tigers question people say that tigers are bigger and stronger than lions but i disagree before you disagree hear me out lions are capable of amazing feats of strength for example a 416 lb lion can pull a carcass weighing 1000 lbs a distance of over 400 feet in such a case there is a weight difference of about 60 and lions as such would need a muscle mass of 60 to acheive such a feat such a task takes the strength of 10 men lions with a muscle mass of 60 have about 250 lbs of muscle the largest of a lions normal prey cape buffalo weighs about 1000 lbs so this is likely the highest amount of weight they are used to carrying though they are certainly capable of carrying more i deduce that it takes 1 4th the amount of muscle to pull such a weight which is how i came up with the strength of the animal studies have shown that lions and tigers of similar weight have similar chest girths so tigers were they bigger would have a decrease in muscle mass producing a slower less effective hunter also tigers are reputed to be faster than lions such a feat would be literally impossible at heavier weights since muscle mass decreases in animals much above 416 lbs which i deduce must be the average weight of both lions and tigers however i do believe that tigers are faster than lions due mainly to their shorter limbs limbs when moved fall in a curve pattern and shorter limbs have a shorter curve and so takes less time to reach it s mark also the receptors that send the message to move has less distance to travel before it reaches the brain the quicker the message the quicker the reaction after reviewing skeletal structures found in encyclopedias i have found that tigers have slightly longer more flexible spines however lions have longer tails and necks and overall length is the same and studies seem to support this according to peter jackson big cat expert the heaviest lion on record was 930 lbs same as a tiger also the heaviest lion in the wild was found to weigh approximately 318 kg compared to 306 kg of the wild male siberain as confirmed by mazak another big cat expert also peter jackson says that the heaviest confirmed wild bengal weighed 568 lbs it seems to me that lions are every bit as big as tigers even grizzlies might not weigh more than lions on average as reports of the chest measurements of these animals were found to be similar to similar sized lions however bears are indeed capable of growing larger as they have a more wider range of rather fat enriched prey also they only reach great weights reported of them when winter approahes as during that time food is particularly hard to come by and increased sizes bring poor hunting ability what s the longest tiger on record answer dear jimmy you have done your homework on this subject there is basically nothing i can add except learn as we do every day from animals you have basically answered your own question s with the research you have done i cannot say for definate what the longest tiger is on record as we do not have tigers in south africa i would have to research it for you kind regards naomi in sa
97903 if you think about siberian tigers scientific studies state that their total population has never exceeded the peak number of about 450 500 specimen essentially almost all in russian far east of the last decade since the early 30s at that time in russia there were apparently from only 20 30 to 50 breeding adults left depending on the source and slowly recovered under protection from hunting extended in 1947 in the last 15 years zoologists have not found specimen exceeding 500lbs including unknown stomach content yet despite having weighed many tens of males perhaps not all fully grown adults i wonder how in the late 20s or in the 50s some people could get 600 700lbs specimen without too much struggle siberian tigers have apparently never been abundant as a tiger subspecies for a number of reasons scientists suggest that their total population was of the order of a very few thousands at max even in 1800s thus well over ten times less than the bengal tiger total population which instead remained abundant up to the end of the first half of the xx century however it is widely accepted that estimates from the far past have to be considered possibly affected by a significant margin of error
97904 wwf and wildlife conservation society are also good for lions
97905 but a warm blooded mammal who weighs 400 569 lbs the measurement of the indian tiger from the balancing tail to the strong pointed teeth measures around 10 ft
97906 a 416 lb lion can pull a carcass weighing 1000 lbs a distance of over 400 feet
97907 i deduced that since lions average somewhere in the 400 lb range this is likely the highest distance that carcass is able to be pulled by the lion
97908 also again believer can you give me a good reason why you believe tigers to be bigger in your own opinion and explain to me if you can how tigers could be faster than lions at such higher weights which i ve already explained is an impossibilty
97909 a tiger has been recorded to drag a gaur on 50 meters
97910 rogue a big tiger had taken his accustomed perch on the highest pedestal in the arena eleven feet above the floor level prince one of the heftiest lions in the show and a bad actor suddenly took it into his head to cause trouble without warning he made a tremendous leap and just managing to sink in his claws dragged the tiger down from his roost had the striped cat expected the attack he could have braced himself and stayed put but the suddenness of the assault was too much for him and he lost his balance the two animals had hardly struck the floor when caeser ran over to join the scrap and help his brother prince win a lion victory rogue fought himself clear of his two assailants and backed up against the iron bars of the big cage it was a clever move for it meant that he would not have to worry about an attack from behind at least his back was protected and that was something then followed a sort of animal boxing match roaring their murderous intent the lions closed in on the tiger but they were temporarily frustrated in their efforts to inflict real damage rogue gave them a boxing lesson slashing away so effectively with his paws that it was impossible for either prince or caeser to get set for one of those deadly bites at the throat that are always the main objective in such a tussle no more than a few seconds elasped before brutus another lion joined in the scrap and now the struggle was more one sided than ever three lions against one tiger having lost many tigers through the ganging up of lions i knew i was up against something pretty serious but there is nothing that can be done in the early moments of such a battle the combatants lose their heads and go temporarily mad so i waited watching not only the fighters but also the other animals all of them nervously alert with a realization of what was going on but unable to decide whether to take part in the scrimmage meanwhile the vast audience was getting a thrill but most people naturally thought it was all part of the regular act rogue seemed undaunted by the arrival of his third adversary he was lashing out in all directions so fast that it was difficult for the eye to follow the lightening like movements of his paws and thus he managed to keep his attackers away until i succeeded in getting the lions to fight me instead of him this i did by poking them with a heavy stick repeating my pokes in rapidfire fashion until they could no longer ignore me then when they came at me i blanked them with my gun the idea of the blank cartridge of course is to startle the beasts and get their minds on something else only in rare caes where the situation is desperate is it necessary to blank an animal smack in the face almost always as i have made clear i level the gun so that the fire goes over the animal s head or to one side on this particular occasion the three lions were perfectly willing to call it a day their fight with rogue had not been very satisfactory
97911 my sumatra tiger chester once fought off seven lions before a crowd at collinsville pennsylvania and emerged from the scrap little the worst for wear i ll have to admit that it is seldom a tiger can hold his own very long in a struggle with several lions that have ganged up but i ve seen it happen often enough in the years i ve been mixing the two species of cats in the ring to feel that i can fairly cite these cases in proof of the prowess of the tiger as a fighter
97912 sulton was in a scrappy mood perhaps disliking the role of movie actor and one by one took on and whipped every tiger in my act it was an amazing performance but i admit not a typical one although i have given my opinion the question of lion tiger superiority is pretty much of a toss up
97913 in a fight between a full grown lion and a full grown tiger i d be inclined to bet on the lion largely because he has certain phsical advantages his mane for instance protects his throat the tiger has no such protection the average lion also is a little bigger and heavier than the average tiger my statement might suggest that i am depreciating the striped cat s speed and terrific ferocity but it is by no means my intention to do so i wouldn t do much frenzied betting on a fight between a lion and tiger of the same age and weight that would be foolish
97914 damon i think youll be pleased with this information from the same encylopedia lions rival tigers for the title of biggest cat in fact lions and tigers are so similar in their physical features that without their distinctively colored fur even scientists have trouble telling them apart male lions weigh between 150 and 250 kg 330 and 550 lb and stand about 123 cm about 48 in tall at the shoulder they measure up to 250 cm 98 in in length not including the tail which measures an additional 90 to 105 cm 35 to 41 in
97915 tiger largest member of the cat family bengal tigers in which females weigh 100 to 160 kg 220 to 350 lb and males weigh 180 to 258 kg 400 to 570 lb the largest tigers are the largest of all cats but since there is much variation in tiger size some lions are bigger than some tigers
97916 the three tigers were now two and a half years old khan male nanda and sita note bebe and mleo were six and atlas and suleiman getting on for three all four were male lions i can only mix in the performing cage never in the den for i must be at hand to protect one from the other i could not put just any lion next to any tiger khan for instance could not sit next to atlas atlas has always been a bold lion and khan is the most potentially dangerous of all my bunch he would defend his right to his tigresses to the death and this would not necessarily mean the death of khan for tigers nearly always win in a battle with a lion
97917 on the one hand the male lion i admit is a beautiful animal for another thing this creature can as we have seen turn into an extremely vicious beast during the breeding season the tiger however is a solitary creature and theres much less of the aggressive drive for status that often leads to endless turmoil among lions
97918 alfred court another famous wild animal trainer had three enormous siberian tigers at one time but he was afraid to put them in a mixed group with lions and other animals for fear there would be a massacre instead he used them in a tiger act with four bengal tigers but even then he said he was always terrified they would attack their smaller relatives
97919 animal facts and feats a guinness record of the animal kingdom
97920 theres much less of the aggressive drive for status that often leads to endless turmoil among lions
97921 correct me if i m wrong but 550 lbs is over 225 kg am i right
97922 like all cats the lion is a muscular hunting machine
97923 i never place much dependence on long nosed cats nine times out of ten they are more vicious than their shorter nosed brethren
97924 mazak didnt measured north indian or epalese tigers he just measured tigers from central and south indian and stated that they average 200 220 kg
97925 the kaladhungi reserved forests have always been famous for their resident tigers
97926 bachelor of powalgarh a trophy tiger of record size prowled through these forests during the 1920s
97927 the best weight of the indian tiger bagged by beresfort in radjputan where the tigers are especially great was 200 kgs 12 5 poods
97928 its skull is 1 5 times bigger than the skull of the bengal tiger
97929 its skull is 2 5 times as big as the skull of the bengal tiger
97930 the best weight of the indian tiger bagged by beresfort in radjputan where the tigers are especially great was 200 kgs 12 5 poods however this weight is said average and ordinary for the manchurian tiger
97931 living for more than 20 years within the far east and being engaged in research of the manchurian fauna on various assignments and instructions from the russian academy of sciences i spent a lot of time hunting big game in the mountains and woods of this wild territory
97932 the tiger has a longer body and is usually more powerful in the back legs having evolved this way for great speed and unmatched leaping power
97933 but before i change my mind i must read some definite proof that pound for pound tiger is stronger tigers have better developed forelimbs and forequarters tigers have better developed hindquarters comparison of skull sizes and other zoological comparisons
97934 we conclude that prey were brought to ground and restrained before a killing bite driven in large part by powerful cervical musculature because large prey is easier to restrain if its head is secured the killing bite was most likely directed to the neck
97935 powerful jaw muscles may reflect a need for sustained rather than high peak bite forces whereas less powerful jaws in the sabercat may reflect a more rapid kill
97936 the amur tiger always inspired people with interest and respect as one of the largest predators on our planet as well as lion and brown bear some he tigers weigh more than 350 kg
97937 description and behavior smuts 1976 reports the following weight series for lions in south africas kruger national park adult males gt 4 years 181 kg n 14 and females 126 kg n 25 sub adult males 2 4 years 146 kg n 25 and females 103 kg n 11 large male cubs 1 2 years 77 kg and females 60 kg the largest adult male weighed 225 kg and the largest female 152 kg smuts 1982
97938 these violent exchanges of male ownership of a pride take place every two to four years between these exchanges social relations between males females and young are fairly peaceful lions spend long days sleeping for up to 20 hours
97939 all of this supports my theory that maybe tigers are slightly lighter than lions with a weight of 416 lbs compared to the 416 66667 for lions
97940 anabel maxine is the author of lairsweb the one you mentioned to be baise but i dont know why you would consider a tiger lover to be baise just becaue she picked lions to be the most likely winner over tigers
97941 i have proven that the tiger is the largest and the greatest cat
97942 when you look upclose youll find that the tigers forelimbs are more muscular
97943 like for example lions in the southern and southeastern part of africa where the average weight is 500lbs
97944 as it was said by scientists that in the ngorongoro crater lions average up to 250 kg
97945 how do we know which animal would win an actual
97946 not the bizillion things that could happen when animals interact in the wild
97947 as far as the bite force is concern i fortunately found a site that used the same source as i did it is written by jonathan wright hes not a big cat professional by any mean but im glad nevertheless
97948 tigers show remarkable strength in pulling a carcass and a well grown male has been observed pulling a pig weighing 200 lb more than half a mi tigers are solitary and dont like sharing their hunting ground
97949 i ll talk of tigers one could argue that since tigers can kill a gaur single handedly they can hunt larger prey and are therefore strongest however this is not true it is true that they can hunt gaur but doing such isn t normal nor safe lions are in my opinion capable of hunting larger prey than tigers
97950 african animals are normally larger than their asian counterparts with the exception of the buffalo which makes up for it with it s far more aggressive nature
97951 here is what he said and quoted quote from dale miquelle
97952 they are frequently known to go down fields and graze alongside domestic cattle and sometimes killing them in fights a gaur never bluffs when it charges when wounded or angry because of their huge size and power gaurs become quite dangerous and yield to nothing even a tiger would avoid taking on such an animal a fight has been reported between a male indian rhino and a bull gaur citation needed reflecting the strength and courage of the gaur
97953 people continue to claim siberians average 500 lbs let me quickly dispell that theory first off at such weights it would have a decreased muscle mass as it is relatively impossible for animals much over 416 lbs to have a muscle mass higher than 60 this is likely due to the fact that at 416 lbs and a body possesing 600 muscles a muscle mass of about 10 of the total number of muscles in the body is the highest possible percentage for an animal that size only smaller animals are capable of higher percentages in muscle mass due to the greater surface area and an increased need for more muscle due to a higher metabolism also not only would such sizes be a disability for a lone hunter in terms of stamina but it would have a greater need for food a great liability for the cat in times of hardship as when food is scarce such as in winter even bears compensate for such increases in weight by hibernating throughout the harshness of winter as in these times they are poor hunters and would waste far more energy looking for food than catching it had tigers been capable of greater weights wouldn t they too be subject to those same conditions it just doesn t seem likely that nature would design a lone hunter with such a great handicap during winter also as there s no proof that a siberian tiger changes it s feeding habits nearing winter i m inclined to believe those are mere claims however i ve presented reason and a clear scientific explaination for my opinions
97954 heres excerpts from tigers in the snow by matthiessen during the time he spent with the siberian tiger project members
97955 in june 1992 we made our 2nd capture a big mature tigress we named lena
97956 little told the southern illinoisan in carbondale that abell also suffered a broken neck caused by the 1 000 pound african lion slinging him around
97957 3 2 m 10 ft 6 in long black maned giant named simba who weighed 375 kg 826 lb in july 1970 other statistics included a shoulder height of 112 cm 44 in and a 132 cm 52 in neck samba s owner professional wild animal trainer adrian nyoka purchased the lion as a six month old cub from dublin zoo in october 1958 up to the age of three years the animal grew along normal lines then suddenly for some unknown reason he started growing at an alarming rate at four and a half years he was 281 kg 620 lb two years later he weighed in at 319 kg 756 lb samba died on 16 january 1973 and his stuffed body is now on display at knaresborough zoo york shire in february 1973 a weight of 408 kg 900 lb was reported for a very obese lion named ali owned by mr charles mason of kingsbridge devon but this poundage was estimated in january 1976 the diet reduced 13 year old animal was sold to an unnamed buyer but died shortly afterwards
97958 if you have ever complained about how tiny your nyc apartment is think about the poor poor 400 pound tiger cooped up in a harlem apartment building police removed the 400 bengal siberian tiger ming
97959 im sorry i didnt realize that those were documentaries and no one eidted anything there also if they say it in the movie that the tiger was dead i guess we must accept it movies rule
97960 south africa amp the garden route walks a rare lion
97961 the lion was captured and tagged it was remarkably healthy with a weight of 1167 6 kg
97962 feb 28 2008 tiger found dead near the gir forest it is said that a gir lion male lion killed it with a bite to the throat
97963 th e biggest highlight today though was first ever sighting of b2 at 07 47 which suprised ast it came out of deep it was the best view of our visit so far at first we were sure that it was the tigress we saw earlier but as it approached the road we could see more clearly it was more bulkier tiger clearly it was the king of this park in its slow stride it was a magnificent creature and was a great joy to see him as he walked from the right side of us on the road and then to the far left the roar it gave was the most awesome sound of authority over all other jungle creatures and ecosystem it was clear in my mind now that tiger is definetly head of eco system after seeing b2 the reason why we couldn t see any nilgai in bandhavgarh is that they could only be seen outside the park
97964 bears are stronger than cats because they are more dense with more fat and stronger and heavier bones
97965 it seems obvious that there are a small number of tigers out there which are superior fighters to the lion but across the majority of the animals the lion would probably indeed be the king of the beasts
97966 it seems obvious that there are a small number of lions out there which are superior fighters to smaller tigers but across the majority of the animals the tiger would probably indeed be the king of the cats
97967 diet carnivorous diet varies according to locality prefers deer wild pigs young buffalo young elephants and cattle in general any prey over 100 pounds in weight but when driven by hunger will eat almost anything fowl fish lizards frogs crocodiles carrion or even humans on occasion hunting method is a slow patient stalk through cover until close enough for the final spring for prey less than half a tigers weight the killing bite is delivered to the nape of the neck for larger prey a throat bite is prefered tigers are heavier predators than lions and average about 50 deer each per year only one hunt in 20 is successful man eating and cattle killing are usually attributed to older tigers injured tigers or young adults unable to leave an over crowded territory oakland zoo feeds feline diet beef fortified with ground bone vitamins and minerals and occasionally whole carcasses
97968 power personified amur tigers are largest cats in the world bigger than lions leopards and any other feline you can find males can weigh up to 600 pounds and stand more than three feet high at the shoulder they have massive front legs and shoulders that allow them to hunt large prey like deer wild goats and sheep they have even been known to hunt and eat bears if tigers live near farms livestock make an easy meal whatever the prey tigers stalk their intended victims to get as close as possible once within range they will make a quick charge and knock their victims down with their powerful paws once on top of the helpless animal the end is near as the tiger bites down on its neck as strong as it is even the most successful tiger captures prey only about one in ten tries but when they are successful they eat a lot up to 80 pounds at a time
97969 actually if she loved the tiger more than she loved the lion she would have said
97970 now that ive already proved my point or supplied evidences
97971 you guys are doing a great job defending truth along with believer i just realized a possible drawback for a lions mane although it protects the lion it is easy to be grabbed by a tiger and pinned to the ground during a fight
97972 lions body is design for fighting for one thing its got longer limbs than tigers longer limbs with a big chest and shoulder muscles which constitute very strong swipe tigers are not as developed on the chest and shoulders as lions but their hind legs are much more developed not useful though for fighting only for hunting
97973 big advantage its got a mane mane have been known to protect the lions neck and to give that illusion that they are larger than their opponents this is an evolutionary process that lions developed thousands of years ago because of all the fighting they have been doing tigers do not have mane or anything for that matter to protect their neck
97974 clyde beatty while mentioning the great escape of his tiger monarch has mentioned the height of the wall monarch had cleared as being 15 16 and 20 at three different places in his books
97975 his full four hundred and fifty pounds on to the back of the innocent bessie outweighed by two hundred pounds bessie was no match for those paws
97976 tigers show remarkable strength in pulling a carcass and a well grown male has been observed pulling a pig weighing 200 lb more than half a mi tigers are solitary and dont like sharing their hunting ground
97977 besides think of it the lion has a much hasher environment than tigers
97978 lions are more likely to hunt together to kill larger animals such as zebras and buffalo and usually hunt alone to kill smaller prey such as warthogs in either case other lions that did not help with the kill still move in to share the food
97979 tigers hunt alone primarily between dusk and dawn traveling 10 to 30 km 6 to 20 mi in a night in search of prey they specialize in killing wild boar and other swine and medium to large deer such as red deer chital and sambar in india and nepal tigers hunt gaur a huge wild cattle weighing up to 1 000 kg 2 200 lb tigers go out of their way to kill the largest prey available and only adult asian elephants and greater one horned rhinoceros are safe from tigers although tigers do kill rhinoceros and elephant calves
97980 my point taken tigers do not have competition with other predators like lions do this is what i mean by harsh environment
97981 it is rare for the tigers to attack gaur unless that gaur is old sick or too young
97982 for one thing they dont risk their lives as lions do if a tiger gets injured that means starvation if a lion gets injured the whole pride will still take care of them this is why male lions risk their lives in fighting nomadic lions theyll even fight them to the death this is something tigers dont do that or not as often
97983 a tiger s territory is too big and it s food supply too spread out for them to be in constant competition for food as lions are
97984 there was once where i was sent to a malaysian zoo i will not specify the name to be a trainee and during the time i spent there there was a transfer of a male african lion from another malaysian zoo to the malaysian zoo i was being posted too well that lion was very aggresive as he was seperated from his mates in the other zoo he was put in a cage adjecent to a cage of a resident male crossbred bengal indochinese tiger this particular male tiger was neutralized a while ago because of his aggresion in fact many zoos in the world neutralize their animals to keep the aggression level down lions are usually not neutralized because the fur of their mane will drop after being neutralized as you know neutralizing an animal makes it the animal safer and less aggressive so the african lion kept pacing around the bars that seperated the animal in an attempt to challenge the tiger the tiger being a neutralized animal did not pay much attention to his new neighbour the zoo uses switches to open up bars of the enclosure during feeding time and cleaning time there was once a particular day where a zookeeper accidentaly turned on a wrong switch during feeding time and the bars seperating the two animals were opened the lion ran into the tigers enclosure and they started snarling at each other before a fight finally broke out all the zookeepers panicked and some of them rush to get the fire extinguisher i was there all along to witness the entire fight the male crossbred tiger weigh around 450lbs while the lion weighed 500lbs the lion was intially more dominant as he was the one who got the advantage of starting the fight but soon after the tiger got controlled of the fight and grabbed the lions mane and pinned the lion down on the floor with its huge paws it was obvious that the lion is in great pain as it didnt move the zookeepers got back with the fire extinguisher and seperated the animals back into their own enclosures after spraying them with carbon dioxide canister both animals were injured but the lion got more injuries and had a large scar at the side of his face anyway the fight took no more than 5 minutes
97985 even pound for pound the tiger is stronger than a lion but this strength advantage at equal size is just so slight that some might say they are pound for pound equal in strength the forearms of the tiger is also stronger than a lion at average weights or even at equal weights tigers scored higher on hrr than the lion so this shows that tigers are stronger than lions at the forearms overall the tiger is also stronger so i would conclude that the tiger is the stronger cat
97986 well your 3rd question has no definite answer up till now there is no way to measure an animals aggressiveness aggressiveness is neither a scaler nor a vector quantity and it cannot be calculated through physics or mathematical formula aggressiveness dont depend on the species subspecies but on individuals and may even depend on the mood of the animal and so time to time an animals aggressiveness is different so there is no definite answer on who is the most aggressive cat in the genus panthera
97987 here is what he said and quoted quote from dale miquelle
97988 for example i saw once a fight between a large african lion and a female bengal tiger the lion was more than twice the size of the tigress and yet she won the fight actually she forced the lion to run away was she stronger definitely no but she was more aggressive and fully confident in herself and this automatically made her the best fighter of the two youve probably heard that lions are more aggressive than tigers but this is not truth there are aggressive lions and there are aggressive tigers these are personality traits and personality is an individual matter
97989 being up to 4 m long crocodiles may capture prey ranging in size from steenbuck and impala to wildebeest and buffalo as well as such miscellaneous items as vervet monkey and lion
97990 very seldom in india have they the crocs managed to cope successfully with an adult tiger
97991 kesri singh discovered that while crossing the river a tiger had fought off and killed a crocodile losing part of his tail in the process
97992 i observed 7 attacks on buffalo one of which was successful
97993 one day i found a tigress with four small cubs she had killed a bull gaur a remarkable feat considering she weighed about three hundred pounds and he two thousand
97994 it has been stated that tigers will never tackle a full grown male gaur but r c morris knew of at least six solitary bulls killed by them
97995 data collected from 1985 to 1995 has revealed that tiger predation is the second largest threat to the rhino population after poaching in the 11 year period 178 rhinos were killed by tigers in the park 149 83 7 percent of them calves
97996 two tigers attacked a big male tusker who fought them off for three hours and next morning the tigers had departed while the elephant lay dead at the foot of the bluff
97997 two attacks of a tiger on female elephants and one on a tusker which was so dreadfully mauled along the whole length of its back that it died a few days later
97998 here perhaps i should mention that trained elephants as well as wild ones are normally very scared of tiger
97999 a ring of some thirty wild elephants who from eight oclock until dawn though their tracks reached to within a few feet of the tiger they had not touched it p 162 10
98000 see you can definately tell who has a thicker upper body
98001 the gaur most dangerous of the wild oxen and an asian relative of the cape buffalo this great beast is the tallest and most powerful member of the buffalo family
98002 largest of the big cats amur tigers can weigh up to 700 lbs lions typically only weigh up to 500 lbs the tiger is also one of the best known large mammals reddish orange to yellow ochre coat with black stripes and white belly males have a ruff especially in the sumatran sub species
98003 pocock 1939a cites an instance in burma of a tiger dragging the carcass of a gaur that 13 men could not move
98004 cooperative hunting has been observed family groups and mated pairs will often hunt together while female is in estrus and they are mating in this way they are able to take larger prey up to the size of an elephant
98005 the principal prey across their range consists of various species of deer and wild pigs including guar bulls weigh up to 2 200 lbs
98006 karanth 1993 examined 181 tiger kills and found that most large prey such as sambar and gaur were killed by throat bites
98007 u karanth pers comm states that in indias nagarhole national park gaur are the main prey including bulls weighing up to 1 000 kg
98008 gaur bos gaurus were preferred by tigers whereas wild pig sus scrofa were under represented in leopard diet and langur presbytis entellus under represented in dhole diet
98009 male lions are built for fighting rather than hunting however they are built for fighting other lions the mane will offer protection but the heavy set front is not conducive to endurance or agility and both individuals face the same constraints although none of the big cats are really built for stamina especially compared to canids and hyaenids the tigers body is built for hunting and fighting so it may not have the same power up front but assuming we are looking at 2 similarly sized individuals the tigers agility will translate into more energy efficiency thus leading to higher stamina at least thats how i see it
98010 not a movie where the lion is supposed to be the gentle
98011 maurice you must be blind the videos i showed you clearly showed their muscular structure compare to the videos i showed you of tigers
98012 jeg im not an expert at all but i do know more about them than the average person plus i work for the public library acquisition dept so i just about have access to just about anything
98013 as far as strength and agility is concern lions are not slow or weaker by any means the documentary videos i have shows lion fighting at great agility the film maker most often slows down the footage in order to show the fights in detail
98014 a wild lion and a wild tiger would be better fighters due to experience but a wild lion by far would be the most skilled and the most experienced plus you add the extreme aggression factor and the evolution of the mane developement in there you have a perfect fighting machine
98015 so lions never stop fighting that is why is hard to find a wild lion that doesnt have any scars or bruises or other form of injuries on their face and body
98016 tigers experience in fighting is just not the same they fight to defend their territory and the right to mate but thats about it they were never groomed or prepped for fighting only for hunting which their mother thought them to do they dont have a father figure like lions do that would demonstrate aggression and fighting skills
98017 again wrong and also lions also get little competition from other animals for e g male lions fight only other lions no other animals can pose a threat to it while tigers have to fight bears dholes and crocs at first place
98018 here is the opinion of david stringer who i consider highly credible
98019 male lions are built for fighting rather than hunting however they are built for fighting other lions the mane will offer protection but the heavy set front is not conducive to endurance or agility and both individuals face the same constraints although none of the big cats are really built for stamina especially compared to canids and hyaenids the tigers body is built for hunting and fighting so it may not have the same power up front but assuming we are looking at 2 similarly sized individuals the tigers agility will translate into more energy efficiency thus leading to higher stamina at least thats how i see it
98020 the mane will offer protection but the heavy set front is not conducive to endurance or agility and both individuals face the same constraints
98021 lions fight every 2 4 years like its said on all books
98022 lions are bigger than bengal tigers bone wise teeth claws and such are bigger siberian tigers are the only cat thats larger than lion but not by much
98023 for example hyenas and crocs have bite force that is greater than both cat but their canine force is weak sabertooth has the greatest canine force but their bite force is weak you should re read his post again and the articles he recommend i got articles of my own too and its the same thing
98024 that s not proof mostly speculation as i ve already posted a response from craig packer stating that the ngorongoro lions had chest girths similar to that found of siberians
98025 the largest male with largely assured references was 350 cm 138 in
98026 nowell and jackson report average weights of 181 kg for males and 126 kg for females
98027 at the age of sixteen months the male cub was capable of killing a buffalo almost as expertly as the tigress he had been hunting on his own then for about five months
98028 three lion cubs about two years old were observed while having considerable difficulty in killing a wildebeest
98029 tigers prey readily on carnivores sloth bear black bear and brown bear sometimes become victims
98030 the deer and the tiger a study of wildlife in india
98031 tigers experience in fighting is just not the same they fight to defend their territory and the right to mate but thats about it they were never groomed or prepped for fighting only for hunting which their mother thought them to do they dont have a father figure like lions do that would demonstrate aggression and fighting skills
98032 is what he said and quoted quote from dale miquelle
98033 on a cool october dawn in 1994 i drove along a forest road through my study area in nagarahole wearing earphones which blocked out all the delightful bird calls which filled the sun dappled jungles around me concentrating intensely on radio signals coming through a receiver slung over my shoulders i swung my hand held antenna to capture these tinny beeps which sounded exactly like the green barbets calls which i was filtering out the signals emanated from a tiny radio transmitter around the neck of a tigress named sundari whom i had collared five years earlier having fixed her location i now knew she lay concealed in a thicket of lantana about 30 metres to my left i had positioned my green gypsy between the tigress and a herd of gaur cropping the lush green themeda grass on the roadside clearing ahead of me on the right i knew sundari was hungry having left her last kill about a week ago i could imagine her inside the lantana thickets her muscular form wound up like a coiled spring waiting for the moment to strike the gaur grazed placidly the massive deep brown forms of the adults a striking contrast to the rich chestnut coat of a very young calf they were a portrait of bovine serenity except for an old cow who looked up from time to time suddenly the radio pulses varied in value as the tigress manoeuvred stealthily inside the thickets positioning herself for the deadly ambush as i looked around taking off my earphones the tigress broke cover and bounded across the road within a couple of metres of my gypsy as the 150 kilogram lethal projectile hurtled towards them the gaur scattered into the heavy shrubbery which lay on their side of the clearing but she had managed to gain that crucial split second element of surprise before she was upon them barely breaking her stride the tigress darted into an opening in the dense cover she was trying to intercept her victim before the gaur herd rolled away like distant thunder a moment later i knew she had succeeded in securing her victim when i heard the pitiful braying of the calf in its death throes blend with her fearsome growls the thick shrubbery shook violently for a few seconds and then became still the rest of the herd milled around at a distance their low throaty growls of fear filling the air
98034 tiger is the most feared predator in its jungle domain when we the human species colonised asia tigers were already prowling in these forests preying on deer pigs wild cattle and an ape as big as us the orangutan like all these prey species primitive men too probably feared the tiger
98035 all large predators killers of prey much bigger than themselves have evolved two basic hunting strategies cursorial or stalk and ambush cursorial predators are built to chase prey over long distances and bring it down through exhaustion the ambushers on the other hand are designed for stealth to get close to the prey and for the short surprise rush barring the cheetah all the other big cats the tiger jaguar leopard snow leopard cougar and even the savanna dwelling lion are essentially stalk and ambush hunters
98036 the tiger must be big enough to knock down subdue and quickly kill a prey much larger than itself another advantage of large body size is the ability to drag away hide and defend large kills against other predators siberian tigers can weigh more than 300 kilograms the indian tigers are smaller with average males weighing around 200 to 250 kilograms and females a 100 kilos less indian tigers are about 155 to 225 centimetres long including head and body with an additional tail length of 75 to 100 centimetres if measured correctly along the body curves
98037 when a tiger takes down powerful beasts like gaur or sambar three to five times its own size it must avoid getting injured by their flailing hooves or horns to do so the tiger manipulates prey using its forelimbs with their sharp sheathed retractile claws
98038 in open habitats around the lakes of ranthambhore fateh singh rathore and valmik thapar documented tigers coursing after sambar over much longer distances hunting like lions do in african savannas
98039 the initial impact of a tigers charge knocks the prey down in most cases to be followed by a swift bite to the throat nape or the brain case with large prey such as gaur or sambar a throat bite is more commonly used
98040 my studies in nagarahole showed that tigers do not randomly kill prey which they encounter although chital were far more abundant nagarahole tigers appeared to select disproportionately more gaur and sambar however at other sites like chitwan and kanha where large prey are relatively scarcer chital appear to form a high proportion of tigers diet
98041 though the weighing and measuring of lions with extreme care was the established mughal practice as reported by bernier just one record made by jahangir survives when the emperor encountered and shot and exceedingly large lion between delhi and agra on december 22 1623 he took great care to have weighed its length measured from the top of its head to the tip of its tail he noted that in his entire hunting carrier he had never come across such a large magnificent or well proportioned animal as was his practice he order the the imperial painters to take its likeness as he had done several times before when he came across a rare or magnificent bird or animal such as the turkey the zebra or barbary falcon it is regrettable that no other such records are available as much information about these cats would have been extracted from them the lion shot by jahangir weighed eight and one half jahangiri maunds or 255 kilograms 1 jahangir maund 30 10 kilograms it was three and a half cubits zar i shari and two tasu long i e 9 feet 4 inches or about 2 85 metres 1 cubit 31 7 inches and 1 tasu 1 33 inches the weight range of the lion is between 145 225 kilograms
98042 growth potential for lion is much more than tiger they have a natural growth inhibitors thats why lion and tigress mate they produce liger while tiger and lioness mate they produce a leopard size tigon
98043 the problem is sam none of those tigers youre showing are 500lbs
98044 but the chest girths we provided from ngorongoro crater were as large as the siberian tigers
98045 like their african cousins asiatic lions are highly sociable animals living in social units called prides there are however differences in pride make up between the sub species based on the average number of adult females the asiatic pride is smaller studies have shown that most gir prides contain just two adult females as compared to the average african pride which contains 4 to 6 adult females the largest recorded female coalition of asiatic lionesses is a group of five however it must be said that despite the small population and habitat area few individual animals are known further field studies may show that what are currently identified as separate prides may actually be small foraging groups from larger prides adult male asiatic lions exhibit a lesser degree of sociality than african males asiatic males only associate with the pride when mating or on a large kill it has been suggested that this may be due to the smaller prey species available in gir
98046 the males are also less social and only associate with the pride when mating or on a large kill it has been suggested that this may be because of the smaller prey available in gir small prey mean less animals are needed to hunt them down and there would be less meat to share between more lions if the prides were larger
98047 any weight above 600 lbs from a captive animal is likely to reflect obesity
98048 the lion is a 500lbs pure muscle there bodies are built for the fight
98049 why they so muscular because they have 4 things going for them fighting which expends most of their energy and muscles sleep which allows for recuperation eating and having sex
98050 lions have the highest testosterone level which explains for their extreme aggressiveness
98051 lions are the king of all predators when in battle no one matches their brute aggression and fierceness
98052 male lion are capable of speed from 0 50mph in 2 sec
98053 a hunter shattered a lions shoulder with a rifle and amazingly the lion still charges at 50mph
98054 just curious i disagree with you when you said tigers dont have as much documentaries as lions i have 12 books on tigers alone and 8 on lions
98055 i disagree with you when you said tigers dont have as much documentaries as lions i have 12 books on tigers alone and 8 on lions

98057 down sprang caesar determined to seize the offensive but before he could do so bobby had battled his way through caesars paws grabbed his mane so stubbornly that he couldnt move for the next couple of minutes each struggled and strained for an advantage but bobbys hold was so tenacious that they only succeeded in twisting a little with the cameras continuing to grind and getting nothing but a little harmless tug of war energy spent the exhausted bobby tried to roll away from caesar but caesars hold now was as firm as bobbys which had been on his mane seeing this turn in affairs i dashed into the cage already caesars jaws had crunched bobbys neck and when i got there caesar was shaking bobbys limp bloody head and throat from side to side bobbys eyes were turning starey he was dead and it was only two minutes since i had dashed the ammonia into his face i was keenly sorry that i had done it but in thinking it over i became convinced that my part had been negligible the lion is frequently the superior he doubtless would have been the winner in this case no matter what i had done
98058 i understand ths orith guy may feel frustrated now by seeing how everything is in favor of the tiger but should realize that theres more to life than this
98059 let me guess youre going to say thats a tigress too
98060 the hero in this movie was suppose to be the tiger who was trying to save the trainer clyde beatte from the lion but the scene showed the lion the dominating the fight most of the time
98061 in one of his most famous episodes clyde beatty was attacked by one of his tigresses and saved by one of his lions an episode that was reported internationally
98062 down sprang caesar determined to seize the offensive but before he could do so bobby had battled his way through caesars paws grabbed his mane so stubbornly that he couldnt move for the next couple of minutes each struggled and strained for an advantage but bobbys hold was so tenacious that they only succeeded in twisting a little with the cameras continuing to grind and getting nothing but a little harmless tug of war energy spent the exhausted bobby tried to roll away from caesar but caesars hold now was as firm as bobbys which had been on his mane seeing this turn in affairs i dashed into the cage already caesars jaws had crunched bobbys neck and when i got there caesar was shaking bobbys limp bloody head and throat from side to side bobbys eyes were turning starey he was dead and it was only two minutes since i had dashed the ammonia into his face i was keenly sorry that i had done it but in thinking it over i became convinced that my part had been negligible the lion is frequently the superior he doubtless would have been the winner in this case no matter what i had done
98063 how come there is no record that we know of
98064 data collected from 1985 to 1995 has revealed that tiger predation is the second largest threat to the rhino population after poaching in the 11 year period 178 rhinos were killed by tigers in the park 149 83 7 percent of them calves
98065 nagarahole park india night falls in the jungle birds stop singing monkeys cease their constant chatter softly through moon lit shadows moves the most powerful predator on earth the bengal tiger the great beast weighs more than 500 pounds and stretches more than 10 feet in length yet it moves effortlessly and almost silently its eyes burning brightly in search of prey muscles in the tigers massive shoulders and forelimbs ripple as it prowls its powerful jaws and daggerlike teeth remain poised to rip a victims throat or sever its spinal cord in a split second most popular articles in news the ten best laptop bags tata plans globalization and the corn is good for you the 50 best stylish more no more powerful killing machine exists in the world except one boom hit with just one shot from a high powered rifle the mighty tiger collapses in a pool of blood men hidden in the bushes grab the dead animal and hurriedly pull it away
98066 when a tiger takes down powerful beasts like gaur or sambar three to five times its own size it must avoid getting injured by their flailing hooves or horns
98067 mean bfq was lower in cats than canids reflecting the smaller head size of cats relative to body mass but relative to skull length cbs in felids was greater possibly because of their greater skull width relative to length in most carnivores maximal bite forces are used in the killing at the canines where maximal loads will be distributed between adjacent teeth in the anterior region of the jaw in contrast osteophagy requires the concentration of high loads on a limited part of the food item in order to produce material failure the highest bite forces are typically acheivable in carnassial biting which is restricted to one side of the mandible rather than distributed between left and right jaws our results suggest that although the capacity of teeth and probably crania to resist high stresses on hard substances in the cheek tooth rowis anessential adaptation to specialized osteophagy in mammals particularly high bite strength relative to body size is not
98068 in the 11 year period 178 rhinos were killed by tigers in the park 149 83 7 percent of them calves
98069 density is estimated at one lion per 7 km2 which would yield a population of 202 adults a total very close to the 1990 census result ravi chellam 1993 this density is comparable to the upper range of estimates of lion density in sub saharan africa for comparison tiger densities in good habitat with abundant prey and low numbers of interspecific competitors kanha national park india and royal chitwan national park nepal are of the order of one tiger per 11 17 km2 schaller 1967 sunquist 1981 smith 1984 karanth 1987 the number of lions appears to have exceeded the estimated carrying capacity of 200 250 animals ravi chellam 1987 rashid 1991 chavan 1993 walker 1994 5

98072 however the strongest bite forces occur at the carnassials or back teeth so lions may have an overall higher bite force
98073 in the 11 year period 178 rhinos were killed by tigers in the park 149 83 7 percent of them calves
98074 the asiatic lion grows to a height of approximately 90cm with their length ranging from 200 280cm their long and hard tails grow to an additional length of 60 90cm lions can weigh in at between 200 275kgs their main prey species consist of nilgai chital sambhar goats buffaloes and occasionally also other smaller animals the lions of gir have made it a habit of killing livestock and sometimes even camels
98075 consequently and because morphology of the canines has long been considered a significant predictor of predatory behaviour in mammalian carnivores wroe et al 1998 farlow amp pianka 2002 we have largely restricted our discussion to estimates of force for static bites at the canines cbs however analyses of bs at the carnassial showed the same qualitative trends as for cbs electronic appendix section c
98076 when we compared the surface temperatures of individual males in serengeti ngorongoro we found that males with darker manes were hotter than those with lighter manes this suggested that darker maned males pay a higher cost in terms of heat stress analysis of our long term data supported this supposition high temperatures interfere with sperm production and males with darker manes had more abnormal sperm eating large meals is known to increase heat load and males with darker manes at less in hot months thus it appears that when temperatures rise males with darker manes must limit their food intake to stay cool

98078 maurice in saw that extract however it should be noted that bfq decreases at heavier weights and according to the study the lion was much heavier
98079 unlike many other cat species tigers readily enter water during hot seasons they will lie half submerged in lakes and ponds during the heat of the day in the ganges brahmaputra mangrove delta region of the sundarbans in india and bangladesh they constantly swim creeks and across broad rivers garga 194 records tigers swimming a 29 km wide river in the sundarbans and mentions the possibility that one may have swum 56 km the sundarbans tigers have taken people out of boats jackson 1991a burton 1933 records a tiger swimming eight km from the malaysian mainland to penang island heptner and sludskii 1972 report the same distances swum across the amu darya and amur rivers in the caspian area and the russian far east respectively in indias ranthambhore tiger reserve tigers have charged into lakes to kill sambar deer so that both animals were momentarily submerged crocodiles have been killed and eaten by tigers in the area v thapar pers comm
98080 as i said these were only estimates not real studies larger brain casings means there s less available space for msucle attachments
98081 a shorter rounder skull means there s more power in the canines but not the carnassials where the most force is generated the killing of large prey requires longer jaws as a wider gape is useful in the killing of large thick prey animals lions have been found to have a more pronounced sagital crest which means a higher bite force
98082 i m not a fanatic i only post proven sources
98083 also note the weight of the male in this study was only 170 kg compared to the 193 kg for a wild animal
98084 maurice a another tiger had a heart weight of 940 g only slightly more than the male lion another lion may very well have a bigger heart as is the case for the above mentioned tiger this proves nothing
98085 maurice a another tiger had a heart weight of 940 g only slightly more than the male lion another lion may very well have a bigger heart as is the case for the above mentioned tiger this proves nothing
98086 maurice bite force quotient does change with size you can t expect a bigger animal to have the same comparative bite force as the smaller animal
98087 you posted a site yourself stating tigers have a bigger brain casing which means an overall smaller area for msucle attachment
98088 what do you mean no proof the tiger with the 940 g heart was mentioned in the artical you posted and which happens to be a lower weight compared to the 170 kg tiger mentioned
98089 also bigger heart sizes doesn t nesseccarily mean the tiger has more stamina
98090 why would tigers regularly hunt gaurs when a sambar or other smaller animal provides plenty to eat also to hunt such large animals means a greater level of energy consumption not to mention the danger in doing such
98091 have you people noticed that here lionfans are fighting as a unit whereas the tigerfans are fighting individually this is like what beatty has mentioned about lions and tigers
98092 30 adults on defense against a single predator lion resulted in 11 death and 8 injured wild dogs adult wild dogs 6 pup were dead and 9 others remained a colony of wild dogs was brought down to a half

98099 all during the 1932 season nero and sultan fought and it struck me more than once that while nero managed to maintain his leadership the constant struggle was beginning to wear him down a bit
98100 siberian tigers are not on average much longer than indian or bengal tigers but they are much heavier and more powerfully built in particular the muzzle is relatively broader and more massive than the other tigers siberian tigers are the largest cats in the world old males have characteristically huge heads and massive forequarters
98101 in siberia male home ranges are 800 1 000 km2 in nepal 60 72 and in india 78 female ranges in similar regions are respectively 100 400 16 20 and 65 km2 corbett estimated a tigress to have a range covering 3 885 km2 kaplanov studied siberian tigers and identified a male who ranged over 3 200 km2 and a female who habitually hunted over 4 200 km2 guggisberg 1975 males cannot afford to be very strictly territorial their ranges are simply too big so strangers are able to pass through territorial defence is passive but males do fight and kill one another in competition for space
98102 when a kill is successful they will typically eat thirty to forty pounds of meat but have been known to eat as much as eighty pounds at one sitting while young cubs may sometimes be vulnerable to predation adult tigers are apex predators they have no natural enemies and unlike the lions leopards and cheetahs of africa who must compete both amongst themselves and with jackals hyenas and vultures tigers face little competition from anything with four legs or feathers
98103 believer can you post vids of showing tigers killing lions
98104 the largest of all cats the tiger is one of the biggest and most fearsome predators in the world weighing up to 500 pounds and measuring more than nine feet from nose to the tip of the tail tigers can travel long distances and bound up to 30 feet in one leap
98105 a commonly asked question is how long do tigers live in the wild not very long in the case of most tigers based on limited studies in chitwan and nagarahole supplemented by anecdotal observations in kanha by h s panwar the following simplified picture can be drawn a tigress produces on and average a litter of three cubs once every two and a half years disease starvation fires floods other predators including man and infanticide killing of cubs of a previous male tiger by a new male who has taken over his range all take a heavy toll of cubs as a result only about 50 percent of them make it through the first year of those surviving juvenile tigers most make it to the dispersal age after dispersal transients compete hard among themselves and with the breeders over kills space and mates some of them disperse into farmlands and get killed probably 20 to 30 percent of transient tigers die every year only those transients who are strong or lucky enough survive to breed male tigers are about five to six years old and females three to four years old when they start breeding the average breeding tenure of females may be around sever to eight years and about half that for males although some resident tigers can live to be 12 to 15 years old the life expectancy at birth for the average tiger may thus be only about three to five years despite such high mortality rates with an adequate prey base tiger populations produce surpluses every year because of their basic biological traits early breeding short gestation large litters and year round short three to four weeks oestrus cycles in a prey rich habitat a breeding tigress probably replaces herself several times during her lifespan
98106 the magnificent tiger panthera tigris linnaeus the indian national animal is a rich colored well striped animal with a short coat the combination of grace strength power has earned the tiger great respect and high esteem indian tigers are famous all over the world and one of the main attractions for the lovers of wild life they are the crowning glory and the light of the indian wild life
98107 tough muscular majestic tigers roam about the sunderbans of bengal
98108 and if the lion is the king of beasts the tiger is surely the emperor
98109 lions raw power and strength has captured the peoples imagination for centuries lions have been revered as gods guardians chinese tradition power british regalness roman
98110 a tiger and a lion facing each other in the wild there wont be any fight the tiger with its survival instinct would want to avoid a costly confrontation but if cornered a male tiger will overpower a male lion 10 out of 10 times
98111 its true that male lions are born to fight but tigers the bengal ones are extremely ferocious the are known to kill purely on instinct to kill and possess a truly killer instinct which a lion dont have
98112 and when pushed to the corner the initimidating mane of lion or other things dont matter to a tiger it will only want to kill whatever is confronting it staying in a pride the lion has become a little sociable while the lone hunter tiger remains the brute savage any questions
98113 the researchers found strong associations between lean body mass and bone size and density but the amount of fat mass either had no relationship to measures of bone strength or a negative one meaning the more fat mass the less dense the bone
98114 tigers show remarkable strength in pulling a carcass and a well grown male has been observed pulling a pig weighing 200 lb more than half a mi tigers are solitary and dont like sharing their hunting ground
98115 there were a number of tough tigers in beattys circus when the movie was made it seemed strange that beatty did not use rajah or rogue or chester for the fight scene against caesar
98116 rajah gave me some bad moments especially when he chose to show the public how easy it was to knock his lighter associates off their seats and i was thinking seriously of assigning him another role in the act when he solved the problem himself by getting a bone lodged in his throat and choking to death
98117 i had almost reached the safety cage when it occurred to ethel lioness to let up on the tiger she was fighting she was dealing this striped enemy a heavier animal as much punishment as she was receiving
98118 as snip was about to past under the pedestal occupied by a strappy lioness the latter jumped down on top of her then almost instantly duke the big lion that had started the fight with rosie a few minutes earlier jumped down off his pedestal and grabbed a tiger
98119 in his excitement theba did not notive that the tunnel door was open and that he could have escaped into the chute and gone to his cage that is the only possible explaination of his queer conduct in climbing back to his seat i stood rooted where i was awaiting developments about ten seconds later hilda one of my better behaved lionesses decided to quit the fray she also too excited to realize the tunnel door was open got back on a pedestal instead of taking her own she scrambled up on the floor seat to the right of the safety cage to reach the door now i must pass between a lion and a tiger i had no intention of attempting anything like that what to do i wasn t panicky but i was decidedly worried and then chester made my decision for me with almost unnatural strength he again tore himself loose from his attackers and teeth bared and face distorted with rage and hate headed for me i made a dash for it straight between the two animals that flanked me right and left to this day i don t know how i ever made it i don t recall being attacked but when i slammed the door of the safety cage i noticed that my shirt was torn and that my left arm was bleeding from a surface wound theba had probably made a pass at ma as i dashed by taken by surprise he had not had a chance to launch a real attack or perhaps he was content with a swipe at me the lions were again on top of chester they had evidently stopped his last dash before he had covered more than a yard all around me i could hear the shrieks of horrified spectators i was a bit dazed from shock but my head cleared and i set to work doing what i could to break up the fight assistants had been standing ready to pump ammonia into the arena but they feared that in addition to affecting the animals the fumes might overcome me i signaled them to let fly at once several of the struggling beasts coughing and choking dashed for the tunnel door only nine animals remained in the arena seven lions and two tigers one of the latter obviously dead yet the lions continued to maul the lifeless body i decided to go in and break up this remnant of the fray one of the animals lunged for me as i neared the group but i turned him with a blaze from my blank cartridge gun then alternately using my chair a pole and my gun i drove the last of the warriors from the arena all except the two tigers one was dead and the other snip was badly injured she just managed to crawl to her cage the best veterinary in the district was quickly summoned to supplement our own first aid efforts but it was too late poor snip died three or four hours later one of the most amazing things about this awful battle the worst arena fight of my whole career was the fact that chester who had been surrounded by lions for almost the entire period of the tussle emerged with no serious injuries he was torn in three or four different places but the wounds were all superfiical and in ten days he was as spry and chipper as ever
98120 in 1931 when sultan was a three year old and a big powerful one in fact what flashed through my mind was that he was the most formidable beast to enter my act since the day five years before when i added nero to the act and he promptly licked the stuffing out of bredo the big lion that was then arena boss and started the reign of nero i
98121 it said 3rd ce bc tigers didnt come into picture till 10 century ad after the lions have vanished from india so kudos to max and thanks for the info
98122 tigers being lonely hunters are more vulnerable to attack by other predators than are lions
98123 while tigers being solitary animals are more prone to wolf dhole bear and croc attacks
98124 and they are known to fight off dholes and to steal their kills infact dholes have special alarming call to alert other dholes when they smell a tiger
98125 enghis a male tiger from ranthambhore was known to jump in water full of crocs and to steal sambars from their deadly jaws
98126 tiger dont have the support of a pride so it depends on its own fighting ability which should be great if it wants to survive

98128 tigers coexist with other predators such as leopards asiatic wild dogs brown bears and wolves throughout most of their range usually there is little interaction between species especially since tigers are mostly nocturnal active at night and the other species are mainly diurnal active during the day
98129 tigers eat a variety of prey ranging in size from termites to elephant calves however an integral component of their diet are large bodied prey weighing about 20 kg 45 lb or larger such as moose deer species pigs cows horses buffalos and goats occasionally they may consume tapirs elephant and rhinoceros calves bear species leopards and asiatic wild dogs
98130 the intensity of aggression is increased when there are high tiger densities for a given area because there is more competition of resources and mating opportunities
98131 they have no natural enemies and unlike the lions leopards and cheetahs of africa who must compete both amongst themselves and with jackals hyenas and vultures tigers face little competition from anything with four legs or feathers
98132 in contrast to male lions male tigers will allow the females and cubs to feed on the kill first females will also share kills even more so than the males they are also much more tolerant of sharing kills with individuals of the same sex
98133 siberian tigers may have a territory up to to 300 400 square miles due to their limited population size resulting in little competition between siberian tigers their large territories are also a result of minimal prey

98138 now i believe there s no difference in terms of size between bengals and siberains
98139 a thick winter coat absent in animals from other populations provides adequate protection against winter temperatures that can drop to 40 despite repeated claims in popular literature that members of the amur population are the largest of all tigers our measurements of more than fifty captured individuals suggest that their body size is similar to that of bengal tigers

98149 the reason i know about the weights and measurements of the bengals in indian zoos is because somebody i used to work with did a study on bengals in indian zoos she contacted many zoos in india that held studbook bengals and asked them if they had weighed their tigers she was able to find out the weights of 19 male bengals the heaviest male she found was 436lbs and the lightest was 382lbs and most of them was around 400lbs

98161 according to information provided by zebra kalahari lodge preliminary results indicate that lions are exceptionally adept at tolerating cold and heat published literature states that lions are most active under 10 c and the fact that lions are successful in the kalahari indicates their ability to tolerate extreme temperatures lions only sweat through the paws and the mucous membranes of the mouth this is why lions are regularly seen lying on their backs with their forepaws upturned they use panting to cool down the core temperature of the body and have a special structure that uses panting to cool down the blood going into the brain data from thermal sensing buttons placed on lions at zebra kalahari lodge indicates that surface temperature can increase up to 3 c when they pant the increased surface temperature is a way of shedding heat away from the core of the body the maximum number of pants recorded in a minute was 190

98166 field observations showed that leopards flee tigers and wild dogs by climbing trees tigers also appropriated wild dog and leopard kills wild dogs were observed scavenging tiger and leopard kills when they were away in one instance the leopard returned to the kill later on one occasion a tiger and leopard fed on kills less than 300 meters apart without being aware of each other on another occasion a pack of wild dogs were 50 meters away from a resting tiger without either being aware of each others presence this shows that both tigers and wild dogs are socially dominant over leopards but does not result in spatial separation all three share the same space however tiger and leopards kill and eat wild dogs occasionally the impression is that the need to defend kills does not play a significant rloe because of the dense cover and high tree density in nagarhole
98167 victor was on a hunt in africa with professional hunter frikkie dotouit a call came into the main camp that two lions had killed livestock near one of the tracker huts at daylight victor and frikkie were on the tracks of two adult males one very large after about a mile the tracks split they took the larger set of tracks until they lost them in tall grass and thorn bush frikkie called in reinforcements and soon five hounds arrived the hounds quickly caught the scent and found the lion who was quickly up and running after a few hundred yards the lion crouched and growled at the circling hounds victor and frikkie were working their way into shooting range when the lion let out a bass drum roar that made victors chest vibrate the lion sprang to his feet looking directly at them he then dashed out in front of the hounds again and was on the run the thick grass and thorn bush gave way to a more open park area once in the open the lion in huge bounds cleared the brush and headed for a thorn tree in a very unusual move the lion attempted to leap into the tree breaking the first branch and tumbling back down he quickly leapt back up into the tree like an alley cat climbing to the top of the tree causing the tree to sway like a slinky victor was in the direct sunshine the lion in the shade of the tree in a quartered position the wind was blowing the leaves casting shimmering shadows on the lions tawny hide victor focused on the mane and the outer perimeter and followed it down to the heart area letting the arrow fly victor got off a perfect heart shot the lion slumped and died in the tree within seconds victors lion weighed in at 650 lbs and was 10 feet long his official score is 26 and 14 16 and he is the new 1 world record with a bow
98168 in 1996 the marsh pride had been left without the protection of adult pride males so we expected the arrival of two stunning adult male lions to be warmly greeted by the females but no an aggressive approach was met with an equally aggressive group of lionesses who saw the first male off the tables were turned when the second darker male moved in the females lost their nerve and scattered with the young males in particular danger the pride dashed for the cover of the forest these two must eventually have moved in successfully when filming was over but two years later the line up had changed again
98169 in 1998 a coalition of two new males had fought off their older rivals and taken up residence with the marsh females almost certainly unrelated they seemed an unlikely alliance the large maned male scar appeared to attract most female attention he was probably father to the majority of the cubs life at the top is short by the next series scruffy had paid with his life for liaising with a female from another pride and killing cattle alone even the impressive scar was vulnerable once again two new males saw their chance to bid for the lush marsh territory these topi males made repeated forays into the marsh scar was finally forced to leave and the other younger males fled with the pride in disarray the topi males struggled to take control by 2002 they had a firm grip on the pride and had fathered several families of cubs a lions life is never easy on one occasion the topi males were challenged by two fit males from the ridge pride who had strayed a long way from home perhaps looking to extend their territory into the highly prized marsh lands
98170 tension increased still further when scar reappeared he hadnt been spotted for some time and was presumed dead he had in fact joined forces with two of his young sons pushed out by the topi males two years before scar didnt stay around long the ridge males were repelled and stability returned but by 2004 one of the topi males had been killed by buffalo leaving the younger whom we named simba alone and insecure as usual new males were quick to spot the opportunity and began to invade overnight simba was driven to the edges of his territory and the entire pride disappeared not long after filming the takeover became final the pride fragmented leaving the two new males to rule over the prides four cubless females for a while simba stayed with the older females and cubs unlike times past this rift seems permanent and the marsh pride remains split apart we next catch up with the marsh pride in 2006 simba has long gone his fate unknown one of the new pride males had recently been attacked and killed by three invading males
98171 the marsh pride looks well fed and content but all is not rosy a few months ago notchs colleague was attacked and killed by three adult males invaders he survived but with a pair of young and ambitious males reported in the area notch is going to have to lay his life on the line to defend his family sooner or later
98172 tiger safari planned near ranthambore calcutta news net tuesday 5th february 2008 ians a tiger safari may soon be launched near rajasthans ranthambore national park where the big cats will be left in large enclosures for tourists to sight them easily the move also aims at reducing territorial fights among tigers plans are afoot to start the safari in the sawai mansingh sanctuary near the ranthambore park over 170 km from here and chief minister vasundhara raje has already given the go ahead to the project sources in the forest department told ians the state government has to now send the proposal to the centre for its approval the sawai mansingh wildlife sanctuary is located 16 km from ranthambore and 10 km from sawai madhopur and is part of the buffer zone of the national park according to the forest department proposal the safari will be developed in an area of 70 80 hectares in the sanctuary that is spread over 127 sq km as per plans huge enclosures will be made in which tigers from ranthambore would be left to roam freely making it much easier for tourists to sight the wild cats the area will have three pathways two for visitors and the third only to be used by the forest department the safari will be conducted by either jeep or canter vehicles the need for a separate tiger safari was felt as wildlife experts were of the view that increasing tourist traffic was affecting the habitat of tigers in ranthambore the project also aims at resolving another problem reducing fights among tigers over territory attributed to the increase in their population according to a recent census the tiger population in the park has increased to 32 from 26 in 2005 additionally there are an estimated 13 cubs this increase in numbers often results in bloody clashes between the wild animals to mark their territory the ranthambore national park covers an area of around 500 sq km if combined with the sawai mansingh sanctuary ranthambore was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1957 and gained the protection of project tiger in 1974 by 1981 it got the status of a national park tigers are territorial and fiercely defensive a tigress may have a territory of 20 sq km while that of males range between 40 and 80 sq km but their territory varies from forest to forest depending on the areas ecology and territorial disputes between the wild cats are quite violent they not only sustain injuries but at times also starve for days two tigresses had clashed bitterly in the khemcha kund area of the park in june last year and one of them was severely wounded

98203 it is true that tigers are faster than lions but this has nothing to do with leg strength which i ve found to be equal between the two this is due to the tiger s shorter limbs limbs when moved fall in a curve pattern and shorter limbs have a shorter curve and so takes less time to reach it s mark also the receptors that sends the command to move has less distance to travel before the brain receives the message the quicker the message the quicker the response lions being taller can only move as fast as their bodies allow without falling over due to it s higher center of gravity lions and tigers alike fight in a way which benefit them most lions quite ungainly on two legs find it easier and much better for forceful strikes to swing while balancing on three limbs the tiger by way of it s speed opts to fight on two legs as gravity is than on it s side and it s able to escape attacks much more quickly either way they are both great fighters and much closer in combat than people realize

98240 sulton was in a scrappy mood perhaps disliking the role of movie actor and one by one took on and whipped every tiger in my act it was an amazing performance but i admit not a typical one although i have given my opinion the question of lion tiger superiority is pretty much of a toss up
98241 in a fight between a full grown lion and a full grown tiger i d be inclined to bet on the lion largely because he has certain phsical advantages his mane for instance protects his throat the tiger has no such protection the average lion also is a little bigger and heavier than the average tiger my statement might suggest that i am depreciating the striped cat s speed and terrific ferocity but it is by no means my intention to do so i wouldn t do much frenzied betting on a fight between a lion and tiger of the same age and weight that would be foolish
98242 i had almost reached the safety cage when it occurred to ethel lioness to let up on the tiger she was fighting she was dealing this striped enemy a heavier animal as much punishment as she was receiving
98243 in 1931 when sultan was a three year old and a big powerful one in fact what flashed through my mind was that he was the most formidable beast to enter my act since the day five years before when i added nero to the act and he promptly licked the stuffing out of bredo the big lion that was then arena boss and started the reign of nero i
98244 actually testosterone has little effect in terms of size it just means that the potential for growth is higher sort of like protein in the body in order for it to work you must give it some physical stimulation
98245 testosterone naturally affects an animal your logic is flawed female spotted hyenas often have to do less hunting than males but because their testosterone is much greater they grow to greater size
98246 at least 100lb heavier than africas biggest lion the tiger is the true king of the jungle his head is as big as my chest his fangs are long enough to skewer me from sternum to scapula and his paws look big enough to scrape a shallow grave for me the mahout and the elephant if need be his eyes look straight into mine reflecting something between the nonchalant and the psychotic making it perfectly clear that if he wanted me he could have me and theres nothing i could do about it
98247 the heaviest indian tiger weighed 258 2 kg hewett 1938

98249 tigers are not faster than lions they both have similer speeds its impossible for tigers to be faster
98250 an increase in testosterone means that energy is increased and by contrast your need for pysical activity
98251 i can cite many an instance in favor of the lion even as i am writting this one of my tigresses is dying in consequense of a brief encounter with the maned enemy and she is only one of a half dozen tigers i have lost this way
98252 the correct way to measure a tiger is to lay the animal on it s back and take a reading between pegs placed at the point of the nose and tip of the extended tail the result being some 10 12 per cent less than the over the curve measurement if yankovsky had used this method on his larger tiger it would have pegged c 3 50 m 11ft 6in but even this length is totally unimaginable for a creature of such symmetrical build according to baikov 1936 the man eating tiger known as great van which he shot in the khailinkhe forest se manchuria measured nearly 4 m 13ft 1 5 in over the curves but a published photograph showed a tiger of quite ordinary proportions the longest accurately measured tiger on record was a 3 22 m 10ft 7in specimen tail 1 09 m 3ft 7in shot by col evans gordan at ramshai hab in the duars bengal it measured 101 cm 40 in at the shoulder and weighed a surprisingly low 223 kg 491 lb rowland ward 1907 another huge male shot at bhandai pari central provinces by v a herbert measured 3 21 m 10ft 6 3 4in between pegs rowland ward 1907
98253 the longest accurately measured african lion on record was a 3 33 m 10ft 11in black maned giant shot by jk roberts in the sudan also measured 3 33 m 10ft 11in rowland ward 1969 edouard foa 1899 shot a lion on the zambesi which he said measured 3 57 m 11ft 8 3 4in and wells 1933 cites a length of 3 81 m 12ft 6in for another lion killed on the klaserie river in northern transval but these figures were skin measurements richard meinertzhagen 193 shot a 2 84m 9ft 4in individual in kenya which weighed 229 kg 506 lb and another male measuring 3 01m 9ft 10 1 5in killed in the same country by rear admiral r montgomerie tipped the scales at 235kg 516 lb rowland ward 1928 roberts 1951 mentions a 2 99m 9ft 10in lion shot in the sabi district transvaal south africa which scaled 251 kg 553 lb and a weight of 264 kg 585 lb was reported for a lion length 2 87m 9ft 5in taken in the orange river colony south africa in 1865 another specimen shot by white 1912 was said to have measured 3 01m 9ft 11in in length and scaled just under 272 kg 600 lb

98255 nevertheless a big majority consider the tiger the most formidable of the big cats
98256 the tigers respect for the lion which sometimes is based on what i consider to be out and out fear
98257 in wild animal motion pictures he the tiger seems more formidable than the lion somehow suggesting a greater savagery with more latent power
98258 on one of my movie making excursions to hollywood one of my toughest lions sultan the first was in a scrappy mood and one by one took on and whipped every tiger in my act
98259 there are no greater scrappers than tigers but they avoid fights whereas the lion instinctively starts a fight or joins the nearest one
98260 lion against tiger an extraordinary combat in which the king of the beasts was vanquished in a battle to the death
98261 down sprang caesar determined to seize the offensive but before he could do so bobby had battled his way through caesars paws grabbed his mane so stubbornly that he couldnt move for the next couple of minutes each struggled and strained for an advantage but bobbys hold was so tenacious that they only succeeded in twisting a little with the cameras continuing to grind and getting nothing but a little harmless tug of war energy spent the exhausted bobby tried to roll away from caesar but caesars hold now was as firm as bobbys which had been on his mane seeing this turn in affairs i dashed into the cage already caesars jaws had crunched bobbys neck and when i got there caesar was shaking bobbys limp bloody head and throat from side to side bobbys eyes were turning starey he was dead and it was only two minutes since i had dashed the ammonia into his face i was keenly sorry that i had done it but in thinking it over i became convinced that my part had been negligible the lion is frequently the superior he doubtless would have been the winner in this case no matter what i had done
98262 it was an amazing performance since my entire entourage consisted of big young powerful animals so these were not pushovers that sultan defeated this remarkable lion feinting like a clever boxer and making his opponents miss would then send the off balance enemy sprawling across the arena with a tremendous clout
98263 the first documents an event set up to entertain a prince the fight took place in the pit of a palace compound with the entire encounter being recorded the film showed that the tiger was at an immediate disadvantage tigers use a throat grip as their primary means of killing and the lions thick protective mane prevented the tiger gaining a hold on the throat joint on the other hand the tiger had no special protection so was vulnerable to attack in this fight the tiger was killed
98264 the second piece of film dates back to the 1930s and is still under investigation by this site the documentary owner has yet to view more than a few portions of it and until the film can be converted to a more easily viewed format little more progress can be made on reviewing this piece as far as can be ascertained the film was taken during an expedition to capture some tigers in the gir region of india again the tiger was the loser
98265 there was a great deal of lion and tiger pit fighting held in korea until 1960 historic reports say the lion was found very difficult to beat again due to the head protection afforded by the mane the film mentioned on the previous page has the tiger as the winner but this fight would seem to be only one of many that were carried out and all other reports found to date say the lion usually won
98266 despite the final appearance given by the movie tigers were largely unsuccessful in the gladiatorial area lions were more popular as they put on an excellent fight display whereas tigers were surprisingly reluctant to enter into battle placed in with lions the tigers would often simply retreat
98267 i can cite many an instance in support of the lion even as i am writting this one of my tigresses is dying in consequence of a brief encounter of the maned enemy and she is only one of a half dozen tigers i have lost this way

98290 actually 250kg isnt actually that heavy for a tiger it isnt rare for male bengal tigers to grow to 250kg in the wild as i said previously i havent heard of any adult mature male bengal tiger outside sundarbans which weigh less than 200kgs in the wild in recent years
98291 well bohka is an extremely strong and powerful tiger too according to india nature watch site b2 is getting a little old and bohka is challenging him and has fought him twice usurping some of his territory bohka has already killed another 250 kg male tiger

98295 charger was a famous male bengal tiger that lived in the bandhavgarh national park india
98296 on the final day of our visit i was out for a morning drive in a remote corner of the park when our jeep suddenly came to a stop our driver had heard the shrieking alarm of a langur monkey high in the treetops beside a nearby meadow seconds later the forest erupted with a frenzied series of calls i then saw movement through the trees and those unmistakeable shades of tan and black came into view as a tiger emerged at the edge of the clearing he was a huge male and at close to 300 kilograms was one of the biggest tigers in the park looking at him it was difficult to imagine a more magnificent animal
98297 yeah 250 kg tigers are not only common in central indian tiger reserves but also in all other tiger reserves except sundarbans
98298 although there is some variation in size among the subspecies males generally measure about 11 feet from their nose to the tip of their tail and weigh about 400 pounds females are slightly smaller measuring a little more than 8 feet and weighing about 300 pounds
98299 an average male bengal tiger weighs around 420 pounds it has a body length of 6 feet and a tail length of 3 feet and therefore has a total length of 9 feet long a female bengal tiger is only 300 pounds and 8 feet long including tail
98300 hunting is done communally often using driving and ambushing techniques
98301 yeah 250 kg tigers are not only common in central indian tiger reserves but also in all other tiger reserves except sundarbans
98302 although there is some variation in size among the subspecies males generally measure about 11 feet from their nose to the tip of their tail and weigh about 400 pounds females are slightly smaller measuring a little more than 8 feet and weighing about 300 pounds
98303 an average male bengal tiger weighs around 420 pounds it has a body length of 6 feet and a tail length of 3 feet and therefore has a total length of 9 feet long a female bengal tiger is only 300 pounds and 8 feet long including tail
98304 hunting is done communally often using driving and ambushing techniques
98305 in fact if you minimize both images and put them side by side
98306 btw the animalcorner site puts bengals at 420 lb average and lions at 415 lb average
98307 like us lions are very group oriented an dvery individualistic and of course this often leads to much quarreling also they live in close proximity with other lion prides where accidental invasion is much more likely having to provide for an entire group lions don t take such lightly and often settle such differences by fighting and like us such quarreling leaves them quite agitated and they often feel inclined to take it out on the nearest neighbor such as another pride member and of course like us such happenings are commonplace and they by nature have adapted accordingly as their brains viewing such hostility as normal opted to see such as a normal reaction
98308 there s no solid proof of a tiger hunting an elephant or rhino like it is with lions i already posted the info on lions hunting rhinos
98309 also bigger heart sizes doesn t nesseccarily mean more stamina take cheetahs for example cheetahs have one of the biggest hearts in comparison to size than any mammal yet they tire quickly this is due mainly to the fact that going at high speeds it s heart must work extra hard to supply it s body with enough oxygen also in a sprint a cheetah may have taken up to 7 steps all in the span of a second compared to the 4 of most mammals that means that in the same length of time the cheetah has used up more energy hence lower stamina tigers are the same way such agility requires a relatively bigger heart to supply it s body with enough feul but this also means the big cat uses up more energy quicker lions have more stamina
98310 so lets say a lion and a tiger were to walk as far as they possibly could do so before they became tired and could walk no more im quite certain the cat with the bigger heart capable of supplying more oxygen to the muscles would be the last one standing
98311 actually you re still wrong tigers comparatively have shorter forelimbs which puts more pressure on the front joints and burns heat much more quickly this uses up precious oxygen also they have slightly greater amounts of fat which means the skeleton must carry a greater load for the same work effort the tiger would have lower stamina do you need proof look at animals with great stamina hyenas wild dogs wolves they have comparatively longer forelimbs which lessons the amount of pressure the forelimbs must overcome but by contrast puts more on the hind limbs so they are likely to be slower
98312 just because tigers swim more often doesn t mean they re better swimmers lions acn swim too what are you trying to prove here that tigers are better than lions

98324 this puts the total world population at about 600 said alexei vaisman head of the russia wwfs anti animal trafficking programme mr vaisman said that at one point the tigers were close to being extinct the creatures main habitats are eastern russia and north east china the tiger can grow up to 3 3 metres long and weigh as much as 300kg 660lb they are fierce beasts that have been known to attack bears
98325 so then i guess you would agree that if a lion fights more it doesnt make it a better fighter right
98326 for the record i do not advocate animal fighting i find the tiger lion who would win debate entirely pointless as tigers and lions once removed of their external facades are near equals and victory depends on the individuals circumstances involved i simply find it irritating how this site has become a reflection of erroneous claims for the naive populace to fall victim to especially when it speaks badly for living beings in desperate need of conservation
98327 cause something is clear theres only one predator stronger than lion tiger and thats the bear in the animal world
98328 for any animal family that abide on both the african and asian continents the one on african continent is faar stronger fiercer tougher and more resilient in general african cats will overshadow their asiatic counterparts that is why the lion will win this fight name one animal anywhere in the world that can take down an african bull elephant can you say the same thing for asian elephants kolly
98329 if the tiger want to kill you it will kill you you cannot change a tigers mind
98330 ray of hope read my posts i already explained how it s impossible that tigers would have greater stamina

98332 five lions had always been sent into the arena against four tigers that seemed proof to me that the tiger was the lions master
98333 lion against bear elephant against tiger or rhinoceros and one tiger versus two lions a lion and a lioness even though
98334 lions are capable of amazing feats of strength for example a 416 lb lion can drag a 1000 lb carcass a distance of over 400 feet but how much muscle is needed to pull such a weight and how does that compare to the average person listen to this
98335 straining every muscle the lion drags the domestic horse to a shady spot under a tree
98336 humans are very group oriented and in ancient times wars between separate parties were commonplace again the reason for such is obvious people are individualistic and different people often had conflicting ideas they sought to settle such differences by fighting and of course men often took control of such situations often to the exclusion of women which may have been more by accident than natural selection now obviously fighting requires a certain level of aggression and fighting reqularly often left people quite agitated as the years went by such reactions became commonplace and a part of a man s biology less intelligent animals react the same way like us lions are very group oriented an dvery individualistic and of course this often leads to much quarreling also they live in close proximity with other lion prides where accidental invasion is much more likely having to provide for an entire group lions don t take such lightly and often settle such differences by fighting and like us such quarreling leaves them quite agitated and they often feel inclined to take it out on the nearest neighbor such as another pride member and of course like us such happenings are commonplace and they by nature have adapted accordingly as their brains viewing such hostility as normal opted to see such as a normal reaction
98337 lionesses though smaller than males are just as quarrelsome however being so group oriented as they are being aggressive towards males wouldn t be very benefitial to their future survival so they direct such hostility toward other female lions so why then are they smaller than the males the reason for such though unclear to scientists is simple though the males benefit from group living they are by comparison loners and usually only congregate with a few other males and of course usually leave the females to their own bussiness females being more group oriented doesn t need to be as big and by group hunting are still able to hunt large prey animals in the wild often opt to hunting prey which are easiest to catch for lions big slow animals offer less of a challenge because they are slower and offer less of a struggle in groups however for lions the most numerous are wildebeast tigers though loners by comparison would also want to hunt the prey animals which offer less struggle or sacrafice this is easily acheivable as the most numerous prey animals happens to be deer which are smaller than wildebeast for lone animals this makes sense as they must provide for themselves and they msut conserve their energy for later hunts that s why they have developed shorter jaws an dlonger teeth as such is only benefitial in the quick killing of small prey a tiger s teeth which are it s most deadly weapon is very long and it s shorter jaws mean the bite force in the canines is highened and enables ot s teeth to fit more easily between the neck vertebrae of it s prey a technique which can only be attempted with smaller prey as large animals have too thick a neck and must be subdued by strangulation in which longer teeth is not needed they are also faster than lions though decidedly have a shorter rib cage so they tire easily this may be one of the reasons it lives in forests as this provides the perfect cover for a shorter chase also longer teeth as is typical of all things are more brittle than shorter ones so it makes more sense to hunt smaller prey which of course may further explain it s greater speed something which is not needed for the hunting of large animals which are usually slower
98338 there is yet another reason why lions are group oriented competition with highened competition with either rivals or other predators which may endanger the cubs such group living is than nesseccary for the future survival of it s kind as it offers more protection i ll also give more reasons why tigers are less aggressive than lions although male tigers like lions are territorial their territories are far larger due mainly to their lower preey densities which means they must travel farther in search of prey obviuosly such a big expanse is harder to protect so territorial incursions from invading males are often overlooked they are much more aggressive in their fights over females but even then fights between two males are often passive living alone tigers would want to avoid serious injury and on occasions where fighting is the only option they opt to avoid the use of their teeth as a way of preventing too serious an injury this makes sense as unlike lions who must protect their cubs males offer no help in the rearing of young and may not even recognize their own cubs so they have less at stake also i ll give more reason as to why lions have more competitors when a lion kills another competitor like a leopard or hyena they rarely eat the carcass and only leave the kill after death is certain scientists say this is due to pure hatred in which hyenas return such hatred 100 when tigers kill such animals as sun bears or leopards they are often seen feeding from the carcass or else found with trases of the dead animal in their scat droppings therefore tigers treat such animals as prey rather than competitors and smaller predators know this so they opt to stay out of areas where tigers are most abundant competitors in africa also are usually more group oriented so they are much more deadly even single competitors like the leopard still posses a threat to their cubs survival if living alone means fighting for tigers is passive or else reduced than it makes perfect sense that a lion s mane should serve the same purpose as it conveys a message of strength and power for the open plains such an adaptation is more easily noticed and helps to prevent confrontation but as i explained before lions often put themselves in situations where fighting is the only option 50 of all male lions die this way with such a high fatality rate it s obvious lions fight in a less than passive manner when lions fight they often use their teeth as their first line of defense in order to dish as much injury on such an irritable opponent as posible as is obvious from play fighting lions often target the necks of their foes obviously his opponent is vulnerable in such a position so they opt to turning on their backs and delivering many rabbit kicks to cause his opponent to release his grip with such a defense such an attack on an opponents neck is obviously risky so they opt to go for less vulerable areas like the front legs or rump this is purely learned behavior and smart as by avoiding the neck they prevent the chance of instead misjudging the distance and biting the mane tigers who hardly need use such a technique clearly posses a less combative nature in a fight with a lion they may truly be at a disadvantage a tiger s greater agility may play a key part in defeating a lion so lions may only be succesful in such fights 55 of the time all in all they are both amazing creatures

98341 kalahari lions are smaller than other lions in other more fertile parts of africa normally a male lion weighs up to 225 kg but kalahari males normally weigh between 180 and 200 kg lionesses normally weigh up to 120 kg but kalahari lionesses only weigh up to 120 kg
98342 according to information provided by zebra kalahari lodge preliminary results indicate that lions are exceptionally adept at tolerating cold and heat published literature states that lions are most active under 10 c and the fact that lions are successful in the kalahari indicates their ability to tolerate extreme temperatures lions only sweat through the paws and the mucous membranes of the mouth this is why lions are regularly seen lying on their backs with their forepaws upturned they use panting to cool down the core temperature of the body and have a special structure that uses panting to cool down the blood going into the brain data from thermal sensing buttons placed on lions at zebra kalahari lodge indicates that surface temperature can increase up to 3 c when they pant the increased surface temperature is a way of shedding heat away from the core of the body the maximum number of pants recorded in a minute was 190
98343 with such a greater likelyhood of confrontation lions grew taller as a way of intimidation

98346 kalahari lions are smaller than other lions in other more fertile parts of africa normally a male lion weighs up to 225 kg but kalahari males normally weigh between 180 and 200 kg lionesses normally weigh up to 120 kg but kalahari lionesses only weigh up to 120 kg
98347 according to information provided by zebra kalahari lodge preliminary results indicate that lions are exceptionally adept at tolerating cold and heat published literature states that lions are most active under 10 c and the fact that lions are successful in the kalahari indicates their ability to tolerate extreme temperatures lions only sweat through the paws and the mucous membranes of the mouth this is why lions are regularly seen lying on their backs with their forepaws upturned they use panting to cool down the core temperature of the body and have a special structure that uses panting to cool down the blood going into the brain data from thermal sensing buttons placed on lions at zebra kalahari lodge indicates that surface temperature can increase up to 3 c when they pant the increased surface temperature is a way of shedding heat away from the core of the body the maximum number of pants recorded in a minute was 190
98348 there s no none case of a 150 kg lion as far as i know
98349 weighed by meinertzhagen 1938 14 males from 150 kg to 180 kg mean 172 kg four males weighed 167 171 176 and 184 kg
98350 tigers aren t genetically bigger than lions do you even know what that means genetically bigger means that proportionately speaking i e height length bone mass they are bigger however studies have shown that lions and tigers of similar sizes have been found with similar chest girths this means that at the same weights they have the same requirement for muscle mass so proportionately they are equal
98351 weights and measurements of some internal organs of threefemales and one male with lengths of head and body of 1720 1650 1650 and 1980 mm and weights of 145 135 97 and 170
98352 males lions especially when younger are far less risk averse than the females and will tackle larger prey far more frequently the west street males caught five giraffe in a month when they first came into the area as five young adults and the young charleston males two of whom became the rollercoaster males caught eight giraffe in two months the eyrefield males once caught an adult rhino cow

98356 right it s the lion that would maybe win about 55 times out of a hundred kodiak bears are greatly overratted they may win 65 70 of the time but that s all size alone doesn t conclude the winner speed and aggressiveness does
98357 3 to be honest i think you have underrated the bear i seriously doubt it wil be the cat that attacks first and i would like to make it clear to you that bears are pound for pound stronger than cats here is the information christopher gave me you can use it as a reference
98358 in regard of amur tiger ferocity comparison with other panther all i can say is the amur can be highly ferocious and i would consider it more than unsafe to assume otherwise
98359 he is a very powerfully built a heavy skeleton overlaid with thick layers of muscle as strong as rawhide rope he can hook his long grizzly like front claws under a slab of rock that three grown men could not lift and flip it over almost effortlessly
98360 a brown bear took a thousand pound steer a half mile up an almost vertical mountain much of the way through alder tangles with trunks three or four inches thick
98361 the tiger immediately attacked the lion catching him by the throat and in a few minutes killed him this same tiger is i believe still being exhibited in edmondss menagerie
98362 they are natural and deadly enemies and the lions were killed off almost at once when they entered tigers preserves
98363 the tiger never loosed its hold and in a few minutes the lion was dead
98364 tigers show remarkable strength in pulling a carcass and a well grown male has been observed pulling a pig weighing 200 lb more than half a mi tigers are solitary and dont like sharing their hunting ground
98365 lions are capable of amazing feats of strength for example a 416 lb lion can drag a 1000 lb carcass a distance of over 400 feet but how much muscle is needed to pull such a weight and how does that compare to the average person listen to this
98366 straining every muscle the lion drags the domestic horse to a shady spot under a tree

98368 straining every muscle the lion drags the domestic horse to a shady spot under a tree
98369 humans are very group oriented and in ancient times wars between separate parties were commonplace again the reason for such is obvious people are individualistic and different people often had conflicting ideas they sought to settle such differences by fighting and of course men often took control of such situations often to the exclusion of women which may have been more by accident than natural selection now obviously fighting requires a certain level of aggression and fighting reqularly often left people quite agitated as the years went by such reactions became commonplace and a part of a man s biology less intelligent animals react the same way like us lions are very group oriented and very individualistic and of course this often leads to much quarreling also they live in close proximity with other lion prides where accidental invasion is much more likely having to provide for an entire group lions don t take such lightly and often settle such differences by fighting and like us such quarreling leaves them quite agitated and they often feel inclined to take it out on the nearest neighbor such as another pride member and of course like us such happenings are commonplace and they by nature have adapted accordingly as their brains viewing such hostility as normal opted to see such as a normal behavioral trait
98370 lionesses though smaller than males are just as quarrelsome however being so group oriented as they are being aggressive towards males wouldn t be very benefitial to their future survival so they direct such hostility toward other female lions so why then are they smaller than the males the reason for such though unclear to scientists is simple though the males benefit from group living they are by comparison loners and usually only congregate with a few other males and of course usually leave the females to their own business females being more group oriented doesn t need to be as big and by group hunting are still able to hunt the largest of prey with the least bit of energy so great size isn t nesseccary
98371 tigers aren t bigger than lions nor are they stronger and this has never been substantiated but if it is proven then show the documents
98372 it seems the tiger lovers try to find anything and everything to show as evidence that the tiger wins
98373 at equal weights a lion or tiger would be just as strong as a bear and right again tigers aren t bigger than lions nor are they stronger and this has never been substantiated but if it is proven then show the documents
98374 answered question subject intelligence question question hello again raphael is it true that tigers are more intelligent than lions because they have higher cephalization value 16 for lions and 17 for tigers tigers having higher cephalization value also proves that tigers are larger than lions isnt it thanks answer hello again sam if you want to compare lions and tigers iq i have a chart for your reference this should clear your doubts anyway i can tell you that there is no need to prove that tigers are larger than lions using cephalization levels because it is a known fact in the scientific world that tigers are usually heavier than lions this is an undisputed fact they may be close in weights however the tigers are still larger raphael heng follow up question hello again raphael im sorry but i dont know what does these words mean 1 fc bom centroid cbs bfq ecv eq can you please give me a difinite answer please do you agree that higher cephalization value is one of the reason why tigers are larger than lions thanks and sorry for disturbing 2 answer hello there sam those short forms of words should be easily found on the net for example bfq bite fore quotient and eq is emotional intelligence quotient which is a simple word that everyone knows please try to find your answers on google or any other web search as the answers there would be much more in depth as i am not really good at explaining and defining words pardon me having higher cephalization value is not the reason why tigers are bigger than lions it is the proof that tigers are bigger than lions but obviously not the reason the reason is the genetics and body structure of both animals and the hc value proves that but it is not the reason since it is just a value an evidence is not a reason this hc value is evidence not reason it is because of the tigers bigger size which cause its cv to be more than that of the lion raphael heng raphael heng

98376 the first documents an event set up to entertain a prince the fight took place in the pit of a palace compound with the entire encounter being recorded the film showed that the tiger was at an immediate disadvantage tigers use a throat grip as their primary means of killing and the lions thick protective mane prevented the tiger gaining a hold on the throat joint on the other hand the tiger had no special protection so was vulnerable to attack in this fight the tiger was killed
98377 the second piece of film dates back to the 1930s and is still under investigation by this site the documentary owner has yet to view more than a few portions of it and until the film can be converted to a more easily viewed format little more progress can be made on reviewing this piece as far as can be ascertained the film was taken during an expedition to capture some tigers in the gir region of india again the tiger was the loser
98378 there was a great deal of lion and tiger pit fighting held in korea until 1960 historic reports say the lion was found very difficult to beat again due to the head protection afforded by the mane the film mentioned on the previous page has the tiger as the winner but this fight would seem to be only one of many that were carried out and all other reports found to date say the lion usually won
98379 despite the final appearance given by the movie tigers were largely unsuccessful in the gladiatorial area lions were more popular as they put on an excellent fight display whereas tigers were surprisingly reluctant to enter into battle placed in with lions the tigers would often simply retreat
98380 i can cite many an instance in support of the lion even as i am writting this one of my tigresses is dying in consequence of a brief encounter of the maned enemy and she is only one of a half dozen tigers i have lost this way
98381 down sprang caesar determined to seize the offensive but before he could do so bobby had battled his way through caesars paws grabbed his mane so stubbornly that he couldnt move for the next couple of minutes each struggled and strained for an advantage but bobbys hold was so tenacious that they only succeeded in twisting a little with the cameras continuing to grind and getting nothing but a little harmless tug of war energy spent the exhausted bobby tried to roll away from caesar but caesars hold now was as firm as bobbys which had been on his mane seeing this turn in affairs i dashed into the cage already caesars jaws had crunched bobbys neck and when i got there caesar was shaking bobbys limp bloody head and throat from side to side bobbys eyes were turning starey he was dead and it was only two minutes since i had dashed the ammonia into his face i was keenly sorry that i had done it but in thinking it over i became convinced that my part had been negligible the lion is frequently the superior he doubtless would have been the winner in this case no matter what i had done
98382 in a fight between a full grown lion and a full grown tiger i d be inclined to bet on the lion largely because he has certain phsical advantages his mane for instance protects his throat the tiger has no such protection the average lion also is a little bigger and heavier than the average tiger my statement might suggest that i am depreciating the striped cat s speed and terrific ferocity but it is by no means my intention to do so i wouldn t do much frenzied betting on a fight between a lion and tiger of the same age and weight that would be foolish
98383 sulton was in a scrappy mood perhaps disliking the role of movie actor and one by one took on and whipped every tiger in my act it was an amazing performance but i admit not a typical one although i have given my opinion the question of lion tiger superiority is pretty much of a toss up
98384 i had almost reached the safety cage when it occurred to ethel lioness to let up on the tiger she was fighting she was dealing this striped enemy a heavier animal as much punishment as she was receiving
98385 in 1931 when sultan was a three year old and a big powerful one in fact what flashed through my mind was that he was the most formidable beast to enter my act since the day five years before when i added nero to the act and he promptly licked the stuffing out of bredo the big lion that was then arena boss and started the reign of nero i

98387 lion against tiger an extraordinary combat in which the king of the beasts was vanquished in a battle to the death
98388 in 1857 a tiger at bromwich broke into the cage of a lion and a fearful scene ensued the lions mane saved his neck and head from being much injured but the tiger at last succeeded in ripping up his belly and in a few minutes he was dead
98389 the tiger is a rare jewel in a treasure chest of truly spectacular indian wildlife when the ancient romans set tiger against lion in the coliseum the tiger invariably won
98390 the only living creature nero really loved was phoebe a tigress which put up such a tremendous fight in the arena that he had transferred her to a golden cage in the palace grounds
98391 occasionally lions were forced to fight tigers but apparently the tigers always won
98392 george stubbs the most famous and original animal painter of his time who was just reaching his peak in 1759 liked to display combats of lion versus tiger though he did not commit the egregious mistake of james wards animal pictures painted later in the century where the lion symbolises britain and the tiger india in reality as we know very clearly from the obscene animal fights staged by the ancient romans in the arena the tiger would win such a fight every time
98393 ancient roman arena where lion versus tiger fights were often staged for the gratification of the crowds in most of these combats the tiger emerged the winner
98394 if we are to believe the records of the old roman arena during those lusty days a lion and a tiger were frequently matched and in such a combat the tiger usually won
98395 bouncie lioness astonished me by jumping down from her high seat near the tunnel door and landing on my big tiger theba who was leaving the arena it was an amazing thing for her to do for theba was almost two hundred pounds heavier than she and capable of wrecking my most pugnacious animal theba didnt waste much time he shook off the determined but much lighter bouncie and grabbed her by the neck why he didnt snap it ill never know he could easily have done so
98396 huerta a 2 year old nubian lion was killed yesterday in a terrific battle with rajah a big bengal tiger in bronx park zoo keepers and attendants made fruitless attempts to stop the bloody duel it was an unequal combat rajah being nearly twice the size of his opponent but huerta fought gamely until he was cornered and killed by the snap of rajahs jaws across the back of his neck in some unexplained manner the door between the cages of the two denizens of the jungle became unbarred during the night and huerta got into rajahs cage about 7 oclock this morning and immediately the battle began huerta had the better of the fight during the first few minutes he seemed as anxious for the fray as the big tiger and was poised for a leap at rajahs throat when the tiger got the death grip with the body of the lion lying inert on the floor rajah sniffed at it a few times to satisfy himself that he had completed his work and then backed into a corner where he began administering to his own wounds he had not come out of the fight unscathed one ear was chewed off his neck and back had been lacerated and he may lose an eye

98398 tigers though loners by comparison would also want to hunt the prey animals which offer less struggle or sacrafice this is easily acheivable as the most numerous prey animals happens to be deer which are smaller than wildebeast for lone animals this makes sense as they must provide for themselves and they msut conserve their energy for later hunts that s why they have developed shorter jaws an dlonger teeth as such is only benefitial in the quick killing of small prey a tiger s teeth which are it s most deadly weapon is very long and it s shorter jaws mean the bite force in the canines is highened and enables ot s teeth to fit more easily between the neck vertebrae of it s prey a technique which can only be attempted with smaller prey as large animals have too thick a neck and must be subdued by strangulation in which longer teeth is not needed they are also faster than lions though decidedly have a shorter rib cage so they tire easily this may be one of the reasons it lives in forests as this provides the perfect cover for a shorter chase also longer teeth as is typical of all things are more brittle than shorter ones so it makes more sense to hunt smaller prey which of course may further explain it s greater speed something which is not needed for the hunting of large animals which are usually slower there is yet another reason why lions are group oriented competition with highened competition with either rivals or other predators which may endanger the cubs such group living is than nesseccary for the future survival of it s kind as it offers more protection i ll also give more reasons why tigers are less aggressive than lions although male tigers like lions are territorial their territories are far larger due mainly to their lower preey densities which means they must travel farther in search of prey obviuosly such a big expanse is harder to protect so territorial incursions from invading males are often overlooked they are much more aggressive in their fights over females but even then fights between two males are often passive living alone tigers would want to avoid serious injury and on occasions where fighting is the only option they opt to avoid the use of their teeth as a way of preventing too serious an injury this makes sense as unlike lions who must protect their cubs males offer no help in the rearing of young and may not even recognize their own cubs so they have less at stake also i ll give more reason as to why lions have more competitors when a lion kills another competitor like a leopard or hyena they rarely eat the carcass and only leave the kill after death is certain scientists say this is due to pure hatred in which hyenas return such hatred 100 when tigers kill such animals as sun bears or leopards they are often seen feeding from the carcass or else found with trases of the dead animal in their scat droppings therefore tigers treat such animals as prey rather than competitors and smaller predators know this so they opt to stay out of areas where tigers are most abundant competitors in africa also are usually more group oriented so they are much more deadly even single competitors like the leopard still posses a threat to their cubs survival if living alone means fighting for tigers is passive or else reduced than it makes perfect sense that a lion s mane should serve the same purpose as it conveys a message of strength and power for the open plains such an adaptation is more easily noticed and helps to prevent confrontation but as i explained before lions often put themselves in situations where fighting is the only option 50 of all male lions die this way with such a high fatality rate it s obvious lions fight in a less than passive manner when lions fight they often use their teeth as their first line of defense in order to dish as much injury on such an irritable opponent as posible as is obvious from play fighting lions often target the necks of their foes obviously his opponent is vulnerable in such a position so they opt to turning on their backs and delivering many rabbit kicks to cause his opponent to release his grip with such a defense such an attack on an opponents neck is obviously risky so they opt to go for less vulerable areas like the front legs or rump this is purely learned behavior and smart as by avoiding the neck they prevent the chance of instead misjudging the distance and biting the mane tigers who hardly need use such a technique clearly posses a less combative nature in a fight with a lion they may truly be at a disadvantage a tiger s greater agility may play a key part in defeating a lion so lions may only be succesful in such fights 55 of the time all in all they are both amazing creatures

98404 a massively powerful animal the african lion weighs in the range of four hundred and fifty to five hundred and fifty pounds for healthy adult males whereas females are usually in the range of three hundred to three hundred and fifty pounds
98405 i believe that lions are stronger because the interactive complicacy of muscle mass and level of testosterone involved in influencing the nature of a big cat invariably indicates that lions have a bigger skull and longer tail moreover as suggested by famous scholars studying animals in the wild like the author of lairweb lions mane give them additional leverage to hunt large preys like bull elephants so you see ive proven here that lions are bigger than tigers and will win against them in fights

98407 the biggest siberian tigers and african lions are about the same size and there is controversy about which is the larger the largest wild lion on record found in south africa weighed 313 kilograms 688 pounds a wild siberian tiger weighed 384 kilograms 845 pounds the trouble is that very few wild lions or tigers have been weighed and weights can vary substantially depending on whether the cat has just fully fed or has an empty belly
98408 the largest wild siberian tiger on record weighed 384 kilograms 845 pounds while a captive lion weighed 423 kilograms 930 pounds some bengal tigers grow to the same length as siberian tigers but they are less stocky and the maximum weight recorded for a wild bengal tiger is 258 2 kilograms 568 pounds weights can vary substantially depending on whether the tiger has just fully fed or has an empty belly

98412 the tiger never loosed its hold and in a few minutes the lion was dead

98414 i have been to many sites in the internet and all of them says the lion is winning or 50 50
98415 the lion in the big cage was shot with a tranquilizer thats why it didnt fight back when the tiger grabbed its mane bogus perhaps but im certain you get the idea
98416 circus cicus tiger skilled in the deceptive art of playing dead
98417 certainly the biggest lions and tigers are close in weight the heaviest lion weighed 930 lbs
98418 here s a site mentioning a 700 lb wild lion
98419 to an extent thats the equivalent of a lion fan saying
98420 being shot with a tranquilizer is not the same as playing dead and has never been referred to such in the field
98421 the lion in the big cage was shot with a tranquilizer thats why it didnt fight back when the tiger grabbed its mane bogus perhaps but im certain you get the idea
98422 at the end of the big cage it is my opinion that the two cats were at a near stalemate the tiger had a decent hold but whether it was flesh or mane remains a mystery the footage does not allow proper detail to declare otherwise and the water from the hose interrupts any chance for thorough study battle was abruptly ended and therefore from my point of view lacks conclusion even though beatty later states that the lion killed the tiger
98423 the tiger has the largest canines of all the big cats at 6 4 to 7 6 centimeters 2 5 to 3 inches long moreover these canines are rich in pressure sensitive nerves enabling the tiger to make an accurate and deadly stab between a victims neck bones to severe the spinal cord
98424 according to modern research of wild siberian tigers in sikhote aline an average adult male tiger gt 35 months weighs 167 3 185 7 kg the average asymptotic limit computed by use of the michaelis menten formula gives 222 3 kg for male tigers and an adult tigress 117 9 122 6 kg respectively the mean weight of historical siberian tigers is supposed to be higher 215 3 226 7 kg for male tigers 6 at least one authority suspects that this is the difference between real weights and hunters estimates 7 dale miquelle program director of the siberian tiger project writes that despite repeated claims in the popular literature that the siberian is the largest of all tigers their measurements on more than fifty captured individuals suggest that body size is in fact similar to that of bengal tigers
98425 an adult gaur weighs between 425 kilograms to 900 kilograms and has a height between 2 1 to 3 4 meters it has a length varying between 2 to 2 5 meters with an average tail length of 60 to 80 centimetres

98428 by relaible data i don t mean a site saying tigers are bigger and stronger than lions or am site saying tigers weigh between 419 665 lbs that s not really reliable in that it doesn t mention studies of any kind to prove it i could post the same of lions what i want you to post is a site mentioning wild animals being measured and weighed where it can be verified like i have
98429 authentic data and a website which is most credible and famous giving true facts is unreliable

98433 the researchers found strong associations between lean body mass and bone size and density but the amount of fat mass either had no relationship to measures of bone strength or a negative one meaning the more fat mass the less dense the bone
98434 when we got back to camp a large group from the forest department were there ready to move into our vacated rest house while participating in a seminar the top officials of the department were present they measured the tiger
98435 either the tiger is stretched out and measurements taken along it s back over the curves as they say or the animal is stretched full length and the measure made from tip of nose between the pegs dave s tiger measured 10 ft 7 between the pegs and 11 ft 1 over the curves while there are drawbacks to this means of checking size shikaris are familiar with it and such recorded measurements as exist are established on it s basis more or less but it does not mean that a more massive tiger could be shot who had lost part of his tail or has a short one and hence not be of record class this has in fact happened
98436 in 1996 the marsh pride had been left without the protection of adult pride males so we expected the arrival of two stunning adult male lions to be warmly greeted by the females but no an aggressive approach was met with an equally aggressive group of lionesses who saw the first male off the tables were turned when the second darker male moved in the females lost their nerve and scattered with the young males in particular danger the pride dashed for the cover of the forest these two must eventually have moved in successfully when filming was over but two years later the line up had changed again
98437 in 1998 a coalition of two new males had fought off their older rivals and taken up residence with the marsh females almost certainly unrelated they seemed an unlikely alliance the large maned male scar appeared to attract most female attention he was probably father to the majority of the cubs
98438 life at the top is short by the next series scruffy had paid with his life for liaising with a female from another pride and killing cattle alone even the impressive scar was vulnerable once again two new males saw their chance to bid for the lush marsh territory these topi males made repeated forays into the marsh scar was finally forced to leave and the other younger males fled with the pride in disarray the topi males struggled to take control by 2002 they had a firm grip on the pride and had fathered several families of cubs
98439 a lions life is never easy on one occasion the topi males were challenged by two fit males from the ridge pride who had strayed a long way from home perhaps looking to extend their territory into the highly prized marsh lands tension increased still further when scar reappeared he hadnt been spotted for some time and was presumed dead he had in fact joined forces with two of his young sons pushed out by the topi males two years before scar didnt stay around long the ridge males were repelled and stability returned
98440 the final sighting of the pride in 2002 saw the topi males presiding over a united pride of four generations of females surrounded by young cubs testament to the tight social fabric created by the females and the security afforded by the pride males but by 2004 one of the topi males had been killed by buffalo leaving the younger whom we named simba alone and insecure as usual new males were quick to spot the opportunity and began to invade overnight simba was driven to the edges of his territory and the entire pride disappeared
98441 not long after filming the takeover became final the pride fragmented leaving the two new males to rule over the prides four cubless females for a while simba stayed with the older females and cubs unlike times past this rift seems permanent and the marsh pride remains split apart we next catch up with the marsh pride in 2006 simba has long gone his fate unknown one of the new pride males had recently been attacked and killed by three invading males
98442 at the ancient times the lion was a chinese zodiac there was no tiger at all

98444 how can you say that when george schaller said tigers have slightly bigger skeleton he was guessing how can you say this
98445 a lot of the habitat would be ok the skeletons pretty much the same as the lion
98446 fights between lions and tigers have been staged the tiger always wins
98447 there is no doubt that in one on one combat
98448 the lion would lose the bengal tiger on average weighs about five hundred
98449 so is the lion of africa wrongly styled the king of beasts because another cat the tiger is bigger fifty pounds heavier and has mastered the lion on many occasions notably in the days when such creaturs were matched in battle in the roman arenas
98450 most naturalists are agreed that the average lion is no match for the average tiger being not only generally smaller but much slower and more clumsy in his movements
98451 in england we have generally been taught to consider the lion as the king of the forest but to convince me of this would be a difficult task as i have frequently been an eye witness of the strength fierceness and agility of the tiger to which the lion in these qualities is much inferior
98452 animal facts and feats a guinness record of the animal kingdom
98453 a tigress in a menagerie at birmingham seized a lion by the throat and killed it in a few minutes
98454 animal facts and feats a guinness record of the animal kingdom
98455 two staged fights were mentioned the tiger won both the tiger gripped the lion with both forepaws rolled it over on its back and then began tearing indiscriminately with both teeth and hind claws making no particular effort to reach its rivals mane protected throat
98456 lion against tiger an extraordinary combat in which the king of the beasts was vanquished in a battle to the death
98457 the descent of man and selection in relation to sex 1871
98458 in 1857 a tiger at bromwich broke into the cage of a lion and a fearful scene ensued the lions mane saved his neck and head from being much injured but the tiger at last succeeded in ripping up his belly and in a few minutes he was dead
98459 in the middle ages a few lions were kept in european menageries in germany england france and italy the best known of these early zoological collections was one belonging to henry i of england that was eventually moved to the tower of london where it remained until 1840 occasionally lions where forced to fight tigers but apparently the tigers always won
98460 occasional fights were also staged between lion and tiger the tiger always won or wolves and bull the wolves always won if in health by attacking the
98461 they have accidentally got into each others cages and the tiger has killed the lion
98462 feats of strength are authenticated of the tiger to which the lion can on evidence lay no claim and of the courage before man the evidence is all on
98463 a tiger is a better fighter than a lion as far as i can discover there is only one instance on record of a lion beating a tiger
98464 the lion is a less active animal than the tiger and apparently not so powerful in every case of a fight between the two occurring in a menagerie the tiger has invariably killed his opponent
98465 george stubbs the most famous and original animal painter of his time who was just reaching his peak in 1759 liked to display combats of lion versus tiger though he did not commit the egregious mistake made in james wards animal pictures painted later in the century where the lion symbolizes britain and the tiger india in reality as we know very clearly from the obscene animal fights staged by the ancient romans in the arena the tiger would win in such a sight every time
98466 when the ancient romans set tiger against lion in the coliseum the tiger invariably won
98467 the clash between the lion and the tiger invariably ends in a victory for the striped beast and in several encounters between king edward
98468 in the records of the roman arena we found that the tiger was usually victorious in such a combat
98469 in fights between a tiger and a lion in the wild the tiger is usually the winner
98470 they are natural and deadly enemies and the lions were killed off almost at once when they entered tigers preserves
98471 and in a personal contest the tiger would generally have the advantage over a lion
98472 in fair fight the royal tiger would be certain to come off conqueror for he is even bolder and stronger than a lion
98473 but the roman emperor was determined to try whether the bengal tiger could fightthe african lion and martial records that the tigers and lions fought and that the tigers always beat the lions
98474 to this may be added the testimony of martial from actual observation of thecontests in the arenas where the tigers always killed their antagonists
98475 martial also states that the tigers always killed the lions in the amphitheatre the lion is in truth a pretentious humbug and owes his reputation to his imposing mane
98476 even a full grown lion has been known to be no match for a full grown tiger the lioness therefore had even less chance and the poor creature lost her life
98477 the tiger in the east indies is more powerful than any met with in other parts of the world it is the undisputed master of the indian forest indeed the royal tiger of bengal is more than a match for the asiatic lion a british officer who resided many years at sierra leone was repeatedly a spectator of combats between the lion and the tiger in which the latter was universally victorious
98478 it would appear from the most correct accounts that the lion is hardly a match for this formidable creature the tiger is as beautiful as dreadful
98479 the tiger if in good condition invariably kills the lion when compelled to fight
98480 the tiger immediately attacked the lion catching him by the throat and in a few minuteskilled him this same tiger is i believe still being exhibited in edmondss menagerie
98481 many of the foregoing facts leave no doubt of the greater ferocity and courage of the tiger as compared with the lion can be equally little question of his greater strength which has been shown by houghton to be only 69 9 per cent for the fore limb and 65 9 per cent for the hind limb in the lion
98482 the lion while usually termed the king of beasts is inferior to the bengal tiger in strength and endurance and the title properly belongs to that species
98483 it is moreover unlikely that an indian lion could contend wilh the tiger as it is much inferior in size and strength
98484 the same tiger is also celebrated for his battle with a lion resulting in the death of the latter the two creatures had been put into one large cage or box which was divided by a partition in the centre so as to separate the two animals while the attendants were
98485 he mentions a case in which a tiger in a menagerie burst through the partition of his den into a lions and in a few minutes killed him
98486 the answer is that there would be one dead lion
98487 if an adult male tiger and an adult male lion were to fight the tiger would win hands down it has far superior strength and ability contrary to popular belief the tiger is the true king of the jungle
98488 alfred court another famous wild animal trainer had three enormous siberian tigers at one time but he was afraid to put them in a mixed group with lions and other animals for fear there would be a massacre instead he used them in a tiger act with four bengal tigers but even then he said he was always terrified they would attack their smaller relatives
98489 q can 1 tiger beat a lion in a fight a the tiger is a better fighter than a lion and dr roy chapman andrews has stated that there is only one instance on record where a lion beat a tiger this occuired
98490 that the typical tiger is a fiercer fighter than the typical lion is common knowledge less widely known is what gives that tiger the advantage simple thing the lion stands on three paws to maul with the fourth but the tiger balances itself on its hind legs to maul with both front paws simultaneously moment by moment the fighting paws on the tigers side generally out number the fighting paws on the lions side by two to one
98491 fights between lions and tigers have been staged the tiger always wins
98492 the lion is a less active animal than the tiger and apparently not so powerful in every case of a fight between the two occurring in a menagerie the tiger has invariably killed his opponent
98493 so is the lion of africa wrongly styled the king of beasts because another cat the tiger is bigger fifty pounds heavier and has mastered the lion on many occasions notably in the days when such creaturs were matched in battle in the roman arenas
98494 a lot of the habitat would be ok the skeletons pretty much the same as the lion
98495 the first documents an event set up to entertain a prince the fight took place in the pit of a palace compound with the entire encounter being recorded the film showed that the tiger was at an immediate disadvantage tigers use a throat grip as their primary means of killing and the lions thick protective mane prevented the tiger gaining a hold on the throat joint on the other hand the tiger had no special protection so was vulnerable to attack in this fight the tiger was killed
98496 the second piece of film dates back to the 1930s and is still under investigation by this site the documentary owner has yet to view more than a few portions of it and until the film can be converted to a more easily viewed format little more progress can be made on reviewing this piece as far as can be ascertained the film was taken during an expedition to capture some tigers in the gir region of india again the tiger was the loser
98497 there was a great deal of lion and tiger pit fighting held in korea until 1960 historic reports say the lion was found very difficult to beat again due to the head protection afforded by the mane the film mentioned on the previous page has the tiger as the winner but this fight would seem to be only one of many that were carried out and all other reports found to date say the lion usually won
98498 despite the final appearance given by the movie tigers were largely unsuccessful in the gladiatorial area lions were more popular as they put on an excellent fight display whereas tigers were surprisingly reluctant to enter into battle placed in with lions the tigers would often simply retreat
98499 down sprang caesar determined to seize the offensive but before he could do so bobby had battled his way through caesars paws grabbed his mane so stubbornly that he couldnt move for the next couple of minutes each struggled and strained for an advantage but bobbys hold was so tenacious that they only succeeded in twisting a little with the cameras continuing to grind and getting nothing but a little harmless tug of war energy spent the exhausted bobby tried to roll away from caesar but caesars hold now was as firm as bobbys which had been on his mane seeing this turn in affairs i dashed into the cage already caesars jaws had crunched bobbys neck and when i got there caesar was shaking bobbys limp bloody head and throat from side to side bobbys eyes were turning starey he was dead and it was only two minutes since i had dashed the ammonia into his face i was keenly sorry that i had done it but in thinking it over i became convinced that my part had been negligible the lion is frequently the superior he doubtless would have been the winner in this case no matter what i had done
98500 in a fight between a full grown lion and a full grown tiger i d be inclined to bet on the lion largely because he has certain phsical advantages his mane for instance protects his throat the tiger has no such protection the average lion also is a little bigger and heavier than the average tiger my statement might suggest that i am depreciating the striped cat s speed and terrific ferocity but it is by no means my intention to do so i wouldn t do much frenzied betting on a fight between a lion and tiger of the same age and weight that would be foolish
98501 sulton was in a scrappy mood perhaps disliking the role of movie actor and one by one took on and whipped every tiger in my act it was an amazing performance but i admit not a typical one although i have given my opinion the question of lion tiger superiority is pretty much of a toss up
98502 i had almost reached the safety cage when it occurred to ethel lioness to let up on the tiger she was fighting she was dealing this striped enemy a heavier animal as much punishment as she was receiving
98503 in 1931 when sultan was a three year old and a big powerful one in fact what flashed through my mind was that he was the most formidable beast to enter my act since the day five years before when i added nero to the act and he promptly licked the stuffing out of bredo the big lion that was then arena boss and started the reign of nero i
98504 from his top pedestal he had hurled himself in a twenty foot spring straight at empress caught her throat in his teeth just as she was riding over the hurdle
98505 can a lion lick a tiger in a fight or vice versa
98506 it is also public research knowledge that the male tigers in india jungle come into conflict with brown bears and more than not are defeated the those tigers are however known for occasionally hunting black bears in these regions
98507 i personally would like to see the sources for the bit of information pertaining to the roman arenas most who relay such testament have derive their data from an epigram written by martial describing a conflict in which a tame tigress killed a male lion also referred to as royal tiger killed a lion and therefore turn around to state that martial claims tigers won more often than not
98508 amur tigers live with wildlife from boreal forests and from other parts of asia says wildlife conservation society biologist dale miquelle who lives in russia and has been studying tigers there for 15 years
98509 nowhere else in the world do tigers need to defend their kills from boreal predators such as wolves brown bears wolverines and lynx while at the same time coexisting with carnivores more common to asia such as the leopard and himalayan black bear
98510 if you havent noticed by now i am neutral and will not stop being so unless given further evidence to indicate that the lion holds the upper hand over the tiger or that the tiger stakes clear definitive leverage over the lion

98517 lions have more stamina because living in the open plains of africa they get more practice at longer running however they live in prides where they can circle prey and preven possible escape routes so greater speed isn t nesseccary
98518 according to brander bengal tigers average about 420 lbs it is only nepal tigers and the biggest siberians
98519 who s that it s completely wrong that s how
98520 victor was on a hunt in africa with professional hunter frikkie dotouit a call came into the main camp that two lions had killed livestock near one of the tracker huts at daylight victor and frikkie were on the tracks of two adult males one very large after about a mile the tracks split they took the larger set of tracks until they lost them in tall grass and thorn bush frikkie called in reinforcements and soon five hounds arrived the hounds quickly caught the scent and found the lion who was quickly up and running after a few hundred yards the lion crouched and growled at the circling hounds victor and frikkie were working their way into shooting range when the lion let out a bass drum roar that made victors chest vibrate the lion sprang to his feet looking directly at them he then dashed out in front of the hounds again and was on the run the thick grass and thorn bush gave way to a more open park area once in the open the lion in huge bounds cleared the brush and headed for a thorn tree in a very unusual move the lion attempted to leap into the tree breaking the first branch and tumbling back down he quickly leapt back up into the tree like an alley cat climbing to the top of the tree causing the tree to sway like a slinky victor was in the direct sunshine the lion in the shade of the tree in a quartered position the wind was blowing the leaves casting shimmering shadows on the lions tawny hide victor focused on the mane and the outer perimeter and followed it down to the heart area letting the arrow fly victor got off a perfect heart shot the lion slumped and died in the tree within seconds victors lion weighed in at 650 lbs and was 10 feet long his official score is 26 and 14 16 and he is the new 1 world record with a bow

98522 the lion is the largest and strongest of all african carnivores a big male can weigh up to 230 kg and reach a height of 1 2 meters at the shoulder this enhanced by a long mane extending from the sides of the face onto the neck and down to the shoulders and chest is an awesome sight and can hardly be confused with any other species females are smaller and more often than not leaner and weigh up to 155 kg

98535 i mean he was a huge adult male he measured 10 feet 3 inches from his nose to the tip of his tail and we dont know what he weighed our scale went to 500 pounds and he bottomed it like it wasnt there we figured he probably weighed close to 600 pounds
98536 after reading so many accounts and opinions of world class experts still he says this
98537 bryden 1899 suggested that an average fully grown male african lion measured c 2 7 m along the straight line c 2 85 m along the curve of the body between the tip of the nose and the tip of the tail consisting of c 1 8 m of head and body and c 90 cm of tail more recently field biologists have carried out measurements confirming an average total length in a straight line of c 2 7 m and suggesting a weight of c 185 kg schaller 1972 bertram 1978 smuts et al 1980 although males living in the prey rich ngorongoro crater tanzania may attain an average weight of over 200 kg

98542 during the days of big game shooting some hunter naturalists tried to assess the body size of lions objectively bryden 1899 suggested that an average fully grown male african lion measured c 2 7 m along the straight line c 2 85 m along the curve of the body between the tip of the nose and the tip of the tail consisting of c 1 8 m of head and body and c 90 cm of tail more recently field biologists have carried out measurements confirming an average total length in a straight line of c 2 7 m and suggesting a weight of c 185 kg schaller 1972 bertram 1978 smuts et al 1980 although males living in the prey rich ngorongoro crater tanzania may attain an average weight of over 200 kg yamaguchi et al unpublished how big was a barbary lion the famous french zoologist cuvier measured a six year old captive reared male barbary lion which had head and body length of 5 pieds 2 pouces c 1 58 m tail length c 66 1 cm height of forequarters c 83 6 cm and of hindquarters c 83 6 cm geoffroy saint hilaire and cuvier 1824 this lion was caught in eastern algeria in 1795 at about one year old and died at ten years old in the jardin des plantes paris although the live lion may not have given cuvier accurate measurements the animal seems to have been very small for a male lion it is however doubtful whether captive barbary lions usually captured as cubs and kept in menageries during the 18th or 19th centuries attained the full body size cuvier himself referred to undesirable captive conditions at the menagerie geoffroy saint hilaire and cuvier 1824 cornish 1899 reported that big cats only lived on an average for two years in london zoo in the mid 1800s
98543 there is however no credible record of body measurements of wild barbary lions g rard 1856 described the size of wild male barbary lions as c 2 3 m from the tip of the nose to the root of the tail which measured c 90 cm and their weight as c 270 300 kg if this had been true barbary lions would indeed have been big amongst lions however the methods of obtaining these measurements e g straight or along the curve were not specified and the accuracy of the measurements themselves may be questionable as g rard made them in the field although pease 1899 1915 suggested that north african lions might have become very heavy because they fed on mutton so much regarding the body length he seems not to have believed what he himself quoted an algerian lion whose head and body length was c 2 5 m and the tail length 75 cm
98544 while the modal prey size of felids is usually less than their body weight packer 1986 lions are expected to take prey gt 45 of their body mass as they are larger than carbone et al s 1999 21 5 kg threshold but the preferred weight range of lions is greater than 100 of their body mass

98565 he finds it hard to belive that a 3 to 4 yr old male would weigh 250kgs and he refuses to read the books of dr ullas karanth or sunquist but he only watches lion king movies and comes with weird fastasies everytime read 2986 and 2987 read those posts its nothing but a big joke damon its all over posting bullshits and cock stories dont prove anything the avg wts of barbary lions was 550lbs as claimed by damon somewhere barbary lions have never been measured only over estimated and many experts believe its only as big as the subsaharan desert lions as usual damon ignored my facts from 2988 and 2980 and comes with weird stories damon i have shown to everyone that you only spread false propaganda malacious lies damon digest the truth you say u dont believe tigers are bigger than lions because you havent seen any and you post selective data of small tigers and the largest data of lions now let me get to the botom of damons doubts damon have you seen a tiger i mean have you visited any national park in india i seriously doubt it because if you have seen you would never ask silly questions tell me which national park you have visited in ur just 23 yrs of life if you have been to nagarhole national park i will ask you some questions on which place you stayed which guide you met whats the travelling cost per day what are meals they serve there which lodge you went and who took you which are some of the land marks there what stories you have heard about tigers folklore that guides tell you abt tigers or the taboda tiger reserve i will ask you a few questions on that place if you have been to bandhwagargh panna kahna corbett or other tiger reserve please tell me i will invite the allexpert site guys to ask questions to u if others in this site have visited that they will ask u some questions to check if you really have seen a tiger in front of u i mean in wild not zoos i request raja also to ask some questions to check damons claims if he says any of the parks plz ask him some questions abt the place where he got down which place he stayed their guest rates which guide he met name the guide what are the popular folklore someland marks abt that place etc the truth will soon come out i will also call some of my friends from indian nature watch to test damons claims if he says he has visited any one more if damon has visited any parks in africa speak up i will request raphael heng to come here and ask questions to you now speak up damon i have prooved how biased ur how u post selective data post malacious lies post false propaganda post coments from experts if you like it but rejects it if u dont like it now i want to proove to everyone that he has never seen a tiger in the wild and only sees and believes lion king moie lol damon dont give me excuses like
98566 smuts 1976 reports the following weight series for lions in south africas kruger national park adult males gt 4 years 181 kg n 14 and females 126 kg n 25 sub adult males 2 4 years 146 kg n 25 and females 103 kg n 11 large male cubs 1 2 years 77 kg and females 60 kg
98567 its time to watch lion king once more damon goo go
98568 but remember according to mazak the heiest recorded wild bengal was only 568 lbs or so and then he goes on to say the heaviest recorded captive siberian weihed only 306 kg do you agree with this
98569 yes i did weigh the animal you are not the first to comment i have not been able to verify the figure as i have now left my work there and returned to the uk but i do remember it was massive and i used a large abattoir scale to do this and a tree and rope it is accurate but i am not sure how the data came to the publication so this is why i hestate to confirm the figure i will be in kenya later this year and will check th old records of post mortem examination in the kws vet unit which i used to run the skeloton was given to the museums but i cannot be sure it was preserved there should be body dimensions data as well but i just remeber it was 6 foot from the base of skull to base of tail
98570 to prove the truth of as by evidence or testimony to substantiate
98571 weight of males usually up to 190 kilograms heaviest specimen measured weighing 260 kilograms 225 kilograms highest ever measured in kruger national park weight of females usually up to 135 kilograms heaviest female measured so far 152 kilograms
98572 kruger national park has transvaal lions and transvaal lions are considered larger than other lions isnt it damon
98573 lions fight using their forepaws and their teeth when two lions of equal strength fight they usually strike the other with their claws often scratching the face these blows can be very violent and cause serious injury usually one of the lions will retreat before the fight gets worse that is when they start actually biting and trying to kill rather then injure or intimidate when a lion feels it is at a disadvantage it will adopt a defensive posture it will lay on its back and use both the forepaws and the hind leg to kick at his rival this is not a submissive sign but rather a more advantageous fight posture since it allows the lion to use the claws on all four legs at the same time it is very rare that lions bite the throat of the rival simply because the rival will not let them reach it also throat biting is more of a predatory technique rather than a fighting one when lions die due to a fight with other lions it is usually as a result of the wounds received during the battle
98574 the type of killing bite usually depends on the size of the prey with throat bites typically being used to kill larger animals
98575 small animals are typically killed with a bite to the back of the neck while larger animals are suffocated with a throat bite
98576 also another myth i would like to debunk is the one where a certain tiger subspecies is more aggressive than the other the myth originated that the bengal tiger is more aggressive than its siberian cousin
98577 the average weight of a male african lion is 185 to 195 kilograms the ones in kruger national park weigh 196 kilograms on average
98578 lions and tigers are extremely similar choosing who would win could often depend on the indivisual specimens however i would say a large enraged siberian tiger would defeat seemingly any lion if it had no choice but to fight because as well should know by now this subspecies of tiger can well out grow any lion now a bengal tiger vs african lion matchup would be more even
98579 since both lions and tigers are good fights as adults are exceedingly aggressive and have the same type of weaponry the tiger would probably hold the slight advantage although the outcome wouldnt depend soley on physical traits
98580 within the temporal region of the skull cross sectional area places limits on the maximal force that can be generated by muscle thomason 1991 and expansion of brain volume impinges on available muscle area within the zygoma consequently within a skull of given length and width greater brain size impinges on maximal bs
98581 now for the tiger yes tigers are larger than lions the the smaller royal bengal tigers weigh about 210 220 kilograms on average females 140 kilograms the bengal tigers in the nepal valley weighed 235 kilograms on average while hunters records put the average bengal at 190 kilograms bengal tigers in nargarahole national park weighed 217 kilograms the siberian tiger panthera tigris altica is the largest tiger subspecies it weights 225 245 kilograms the largest recorded was althought not confirmed considered reliable by most experts at 389 kilograms the largest lion subspeces the barbary lion panthera leo leo weighed 200 kilograms on average with females at 160 kgs
98582 maurice dr smuts reported 181 kg for lions in kruger national park with the larges male weighed 225kg and the largest female 152 kg
98583 tigers living alone and without a maned opponent may truely be at a disadvantage when met with such a strategy
98584 fady only mentioned the weight of one group of lions while he goe on to compare them to some of the largest of tiger groups
98585 the avearge weights listed of nepal tigers or tigers of other more fertile areas seem to have been made on a very small number of individuals
98586 dereck and beverly joubert have claimed the lions of duba to be the biggest they ve ever seen
98587 he mentioned six wins on the part of the lion from his book
98588 the reason for his not previously mentioning sultan in his other books was that sultan was very young and had turned 5 during the making of the big cage movie most of the battles he mentioned happened before this lion s time
98589 raja i doubt tigers dominate lions all the time it is my opinion that lions would be the more consistant winner read my comments from 3008 and 3012
98590 although i d be inclined to favor the lion in a finish fight i could cite many instances of a single tiger fighting off a group of lions in fact my sumatra tiger chester once fought off seven lions before a crowd at collinsville pennsylvania and emerged from the scrap little the worst for wear chester has been in my act for five years and is still going strong veteran of many battles i ll have to admit that it is seldom a tiger can hold his own very long in a struggle with several lions that have ganged up but i ve seen it happen often enough in the years i ve been mixing the two species of cats in the ring to feel that i can fairly cite these cases in proof of the prowess of the tiger as a fighter on the other hand i could bring up a certain amount of pretty convincing evidence on the lion s side of the controversy even while i am writting this one of my favorite tigers princess is dying in consequence of a brief encounter with the maned enemy and princess is only one of a half dozen striped cats that i have lost in the same way since i started my present act so there are two sides to the lion tiger business about which the circus fans inqure so persistantly
98591 when did i lie most of the time in clyde s books he mentions parts of the lives of his animals which happened before sultans time
98592 note carful wording clyde said that the tigris was killed by the maned enemy and that she was only one of a half dozen tigers which have died that way
98593 i ve seen sources on karanth and other quotes mentioned by tiger fans
98594 damon an animals livinig in a low prey base aarea with prey particualrly scarce weigihng same as an animal having a particualrly rich diet crater lions are considered upper limit of lions this proves the the animals living in prey scarve is area is geneticially larger than the animal feeding on the extremely rich diet though according to craig packer siberian tigers are worlds largest cat and would defeat a lion in a fight
98595 wildlife conservationists have just released the results of the first siberian tiger count in far eastern russia in nine years a study that took 1 000 people months to search looking for the animals massive footprints across nearly 70 000 square miles of habitat the results were something of a surprise instead of a decreasing population like most expected the numbers remained about the same as a decade ago the total count for the latest survey between 430 to 530 tigers left including the cubs
98596 bengal tigers weigh so and so without stating the area in which they were measured and the number of animals
98597 maurice that chart on bite force quotient was merely estimates so it is not fact
98598 however everythng i ve mentioned is based on actual studies and i gave mention of lots of sources in perentheses
98599 prwey density changes with area and so to does size
98600 i have also emailed authors who have studied the roman era in depth and they offered an outlook similar to my own
98601 sunquist stated that the book lions in fact and fiction was the only reference they used for their tiger lion battle comparisons
98602 the author did not give me a source for the claim tigers were more successful than lions in the coliseum
98603 i have also emailed authors who have studied the roman era in depth and they offered an outlook similar to my own
98604 there are very few records pertaining to lions and tigers in battle against one another in the arena not enough to state a definitive claim of one being more victorious over the other
98605 from this particular reference sunquist derived the tale of zambezi and ranee a lioness and tigress that grew from cubhood in the same enclosure these were females who had established a domestic bond a relationship that even in skirmish hardly represented the potential exchanges that could transpire between two rival males of the tiger lion species tigers and lions in rome however were never mentioned
98606 tigers have sorter jaws which may offer greater bite strength at the canines where the teeth is longest
98607 within the temporal region of the skull cross sectional area places limits on the maximal force that can be generated by muscle thomason 1991 and expansion of brain volume impinges on available muscle area within the zygoma consequently within a skull of given length and width greater brain size impinges on maximal bs
98608 and can you bring a reliable source which gives the average size of bengals mentioned by karanth
98609 within the temporal region of the skull cross sectional area places limits on the maximal force that can be generated by muscle thomason 1991 and expansion of brain volume impinges on available muscle area within the zygoma consequently within a skull of given length and width greater brain size impinges on maximal bs
98610 also a tiger s bite force has never been measured however lions have been accurately measured with a bite force of 691 940 lbs of force
98611 maurice a lion or tiger s strength has never been measured so it is only speculation to suggest which is stronger
98612 beatty claimed in his book that sultan had defeated those tigers during the making of the movie the big cage in which it may not have been appropriate for any other books which noted stuff from either his other movies or old battles in which sultan was young or else not yet born
98613 hyenas which are bone crushing mammals have a bite force of 1 000 pounds slightly more than the 940 recorded for lions dusky sharks manage 330 pounds of force and a common dog the labrador bites with 125 pounds of force humans surprisingly beat out the pet dog and measured in at 170 pounds of force

98621 a lot of the habitat would be ok the skeletons pretty much the same as the lion only a little larger
98622 a lot of the habitat would be ok the skeletons pretty much the same as the lion only a little larger
98623 using simple physics we have shown a highly possible solution as to how the tiger was able to escape its enclosure from our calculations it was shown that a tiger only needs a little over 26 miles per hour to cross the 33 ft moat and clear the 12 5 ft high wall from the current data that is available a tiger can attain a maximum speed of 35 miles per hour hence the current dimensions of the enclosure are not enough to ensure that a tiger will not escape
98624 a lioness can run as fast as 35 mph for short distances and can leap more that 30 feet
98625 lions can run at speeds over 30 mph but only over short distances lions are able to take down prey three times their size a lions roar can be heard up to 5 miles away roaring is believed to have a territorial function and to help animals locate each other
98626 a lioness can run as fast as 35 mph for short distances and can leap more that 30 feet
98627 lions normally walk 2 4 miles per hour but can run 29 35 miles per hour they are also able to leap distances of up to 36 feet
98628 tigers can run about 35 miles per hour 56 kph roughly as fast as bears and lions they reach such speeds only over short distances about 10 yards 10 m during the attack

98631 hello there sam009tiger as you probably know south china tiger is one of the smaller subspecies of tigers tigerwoods currently weigh around 160kg and 327 weighs around 170kg i think 327 should be the largest male tiger among the three you can see it from the shape of his skeleton we dont have the exact number on their weight and size because to get that number we need to immobilize them first by tranqualizing and that is a big risk to the tigers the only time we tranqualize the tigers was when we attached the radio collars on them hope and cathay please take note that the average weights of south china tigers in zoos throughout china is around 150kg and the tigers here rewilding in south africa are all bigger than their siblings of the same gender the weight of 150kg is the average weight of 10th generation captive bred south china tiger that are suffering from inbreeding in fact all captive south china tigers are suffering from inbreeding they were all descended from just 6 wild caught founders and everyone knows inbred animals tend to be smaller than genetic diversed specimens
98632 just because people say they weigh this much doesn t make it so lions are evey bit as big as tigers i never claimed they were larger nor did i doubt any of the weights claimed of them only doubted the statement that such is common
98633 the african lion is almost the same size that of indian tiger but smaller than siberian tiger
98634 theres a video i saw where a tiger lost to a jaguar but a jaguar and a tiger lost to a lion i hope someone that owns that video post it in youtube

98637 tiger attacked a herd of 6 wild buffaloes killing a cow which he dragged into a scrub forest the forest gaurd accompany us to the site we travelled about 300 metres in the jeep then trudged another 300 metres or so till we came to the spot where the tiger had attacked the buffalo signs of bitter struggle and drag marks were clearly visible we were now on very dangerous ground but kalita had a rifle which was probably more morale boosting than really effective against any determined tiger attack we cautiously followed the drag mark for about 200 metres through a forest of semal silk cotton sheesham and bogory berry when the gaurd signalled us to stop and pointed towards something black beneath a bogori tree it was a wild buffalo kill either the tiger had heard our approach and retired or after the first feed and drink was lying in some cover nearby as he had made no effort to hide the kill the tiger could not have weighed more than 225 kg but he hauled a nearly one tonne carcass over undulating ground for nearly 200 metres about 10 kg of meat had been eaten from rump after dragging out rumen there were severe claw marks on the back of the buffalo the tiger evidetly had leapt over the victim before sinking his long canines into its throat and killing it by strangualtion and suffocation
98638 it is not uncommon that males are killed during territorial fights and thats one reason why there are less adult male tigers than there are female tigers
98639 rajas blog stated nothing new and revealed little in the way of innovative knowledge especially in regards to the tiger lion debate it has all been said before
98640 a question often asked the office of the zoo is if an adult lion and tiger were to fight which would win as we try to keep our adult lions and tigers in the zoo from fighting we did not know until in the records of the roman arena we found that the tiger was usually victorious in such a combat
98641 it the tiger was most dreaded of all the beasts that appeared in the arena
98642 roman emperor nero 37 68 a d had a pet tigress named phoebe which often jointed him for dinner if someone there displeased the emperor the offender might become a special treat for phoebes dinner
98643 roman emperor nero often dined with his pet tigress phoebe if guests dared to upset the emperor they chanced ending up as phoebes dinner
98644 it is said that the infamous nero cherished one thing only a tigress to which he gave the name of phoebe it was one of a convoy of ferocious animals sent to rome from africa to be used in the circuses posters note originally from india via africa the author touched upon that a little in page 65 other books also mentioned this route of transportation it was in the colossium at rome that nero first set eyes on the animal which caused more havoc than three other tigers renowned for their strength and ferocity rather than lose his tigress he would have consented to the loss of one of his richest provinces

98648 he was estimated to be an eight to ten year old male unusally fat and healthy he weighed 385 lbs
98649 i can offer more proof to suggest that lions and tigers are of the same size for my case i ll talk of us humans in regards to people men are usually bigger and stronger than women the reason for such is simple for many years women have often completed tasks which require little size and strength and of course if you spend too much time without using your muscles they dwindle men are quite the opposite and much more likely to pursue such strenuous activities as football or weight lifting such activities also require more testosterone which is more or less directly related to aggression humans are very group oriented and in ancient times wars between separate parties were commonplace again the reason for such is obvious people are individualistic and different people often had conflicting ideas they sought to settle such differences by fighting and of course men often took control of such situations often to the exclusion of women which may have been more by accident than natural selection now obviously fighting requires a certain level of aggression and fighting reqularly often left people quite agitated as the years went by such reactions were reguarded by the brain as normal obviously such aggressive behavior can be very stressing on the body so to cope the brain opts ironically to reduce the part of the brain which controls aggression limiting it s ability to control and so reducing the stressing affects caused by aggression less intelligent animals react the same way like us lions are very group oriented an dvery individualistic and of course this often leads to much quarreling also they live in close proximity with other lion prides where accidental invasion is much more likely having to provide for an entire group lions don t take such lightly and often settle such differences by fighting and like us such quarreling leaves them quite agitated and they often feel inclined to take it out on the nearest neighbor such as another pride member and of course like us such happenings are commonplace and they by nature have adapted accordingly as their brains viewing such hostility as normal opted to see such as a normal reaction lionesses though smaller than males are just as quarrelsome however being so group oriented as they are being aggressive towards males wouldn t be very benefitial to their future survival so they direct such hostility toward other female lions so why then are they smaller than the males the reason for such though unclear to most scientists is simple though the males benefit from group living they are by comparison loners and usually only congregate with a few other males and of course usually leave the females to their own bussiness females being more group oriented doesn t need to be as big and by group hunting are still able to hunt large prey animals in the wild often opt to hunting prey which are easiest to catch for lions big slow animals offer less of a challenge because they are slower and offer less of a struggle in groups however for lions the most numerous are wildebeast tigers though loners by comparison would also want to hunt the prey animals which offer less struggle or sacrafice this is easily acheivable as the most numerous prey animals happens to be deer which are smaller than wildebeast for lone animals this makes sense as they must provide for themselves and they msut conserve their energy for later hunts that s why they have developed shorter jaws an dlonger teeth as such is only benefitial in the quick killing of small prey a tiger s teeth which are it s most deadly weapon is very long and it s shorter jaws mean the bite force in the canines is highened and enables ot s teeth to fit more easily between the neck vertebrae of it s prey a technique which can only be attempted with smaller prey as large animals have too thick a neck and must be subdued by strangulation in which longer teeth is not needed they are also faster than lions though decidedly have a shorter rib cage so they tire easily this may be one of the reasons it lives in forests as this provides the perfect cover for a shorter chase also longer teeth as is typical of all things are more brittle than shorter ones so it makes more sense to hunt smaller prey which of course may further explain it s greater speed something which is not needed for the hunting of large animals which are usually slower there is yet another reason why lions are group oriented competition with highened competition with either rivals or other predators which may endanger the cubs such group living is than nesseccary for the future survival of it s kind as it offers more protection i ll also give more reasons why tigers are less aggressive than lions although male tigers like lions are territorial their territories are far larger due mainly to their lower preey densities which means they must travel farther in search of prey obviuosly such a big expanse is harder to protect so territorial incursions from invading males are often overlooked they are much more aggressive in their fights over females but even then fights between two males are often passive living alone tigers would want to avoid serious injury and on occasions where fighting is the only option they opt to avoid the use of their teeth as a way of preventing too serious an injury this makes sense as unlike lions who must protect their cubs males offer no help in the rearing of young and may not even recognize their own cubs so they have less at stake also i ll give more reason as to why lions have more competitors when a lion kills another competitor like a leopard or hyena they rarely eat the carcass and only leave the kill after death is certain scientists say this is due to pure hatred in which hyenas return such hatred 100 when tigers kill such animals as sun bears or leopards they are often seen feeding from the carcass or else found with trases of the dead animal in their scat droppings therefore tigers treat such animals as prey rather than competitors and smaller predators know this so they opt to stay out of areas where tigers are most abundant competitors in africa also are usually more group oriented so they are much more deadly even single competitors like the leopard still posses a threat to their cubs survival if living alone means fighting for tigers is passive or else reduced than it makes perfect sense that a lion s mane should serve the same purpose as it conveys a message of strength and power for the open plains such an adaptation is more easily noticed and helps to prevent confrontation but as i explained before lions often put themselves in situations where fighting is the only option 50 of all male lions die this way with such a high fatality rate it s obvious lions fight in a less than passive manner when lions fight they often use their teeth as their first line of defense in order to dish as much injury on such an irritable opponent as posible as is obvious from play fighting lions often target the necks of their foes obviously his opponent is vulnerable in such a position so they opt to turning on their backs and delivering many rabbit kicks to cause his opponent to release his grip with such a defense such an attack on an opponents neck is obviously risky so they opt to go for less vulerable areas like the front legs or rump this is purely learned behavior and smart as by avoiding the neck they prevent the chance of instead misjudging the distance and biting the mane tigers who hardly need use such a technique clearly posses a less combative nature in a fight with a lion they may truly be at a disadvantage a tiger s greater agility may play a key part in defeating a lion so lions may only be succesful in such fights 55 of the time all in all they are both amazing creatures
98650 sariska readies for royal romance with the safe release of a 170 kg four year old ranthambhore tigress popularly known as the lakrda female in the second enclosure at naya pani at the stroke of noon on friday sariskas first couple is now in place the tigress was sedated at 7 am and waited till 11 15 when the chopper took off from ranthambhore she appeared in good health when she was released around noon in sariska v p singh the chief of rajasthans tiger task force said the forest department would try to fly in another tigress before the monsoon sets in meanwhile presumably waiting for a partner the t10 male rather unimaginatively identified after his position in ranthambhores tiger index has already made two kills since his arrival at sariska with forest officers wary that any more goat may spoil his prey preference permanently he is all set to walk free later tonight or tomorrow with a prayer that he doesnt stray outside the forest a team of scientists from wildlife institute of india will track his movements round the clock however the two big cats will have to wait before they can check each other out in the wild like the t10 male introduced on june 28 the tigress will spend a few days inside her enclosure before she is freed once the lakrda female is let out sariska will hold its breadth for the royal courtship to begin cats mate easily but occasionally certain pairs act stubborn in this case the t10 male being a rather young tiger forest officials feel he may need a bit of mentoring but the lakrda female so named after her territory in lakrda is a tigress of rare pedigree she is one of the many daughters of the venerable lady of the lake again named after her territory alias machhli fish mark on her skin the tigress famous for successfully raising four litters no doubt the forest officials can trust the lakrda female to take effective early initiatives to repopulate sariska

98660 sulton was in a scrappy mood perhaps disliking the role of movie actor and one by one took on and whipped every tiger in my act it was an amazing performance but i admit not a typical one although i have given my opinion the question of lion tiger superiority is pretty much of a toss up
98661 in a fight between a full grown lion and a full grown tiger i d be inclined to bet on the lion largely because he has certain phsical advantages his mane for instance protects his throat the tiger has no such protection the average lion also is a little bigger and heavier than the average tiger my statement might suggest that i am depreciating the striped cat s speed and terrific ferocity but it is by no means my intention to do so i wouldn t do much frenzied betting on a fight between a lion and tiger of the same age and weight that would be foolish
98662 i had almost reached the safety cage when it occurred to ethel lioness to let up on the tiger she was fighting she was dealing this striped enemy a heavier animal as much punishment as she was receiving
98663 in 1931 when sultan was a three year old and a big powerful one in fact what flashed through my mind was that he was the most formidable beast to enter my act since the day five years before when i added nero to the act and he promptly licked the stuffing out of bredo the big lion that was then arena boss and started the reign of nero i

98696 ill let the tiger fans live in their fantasy world while we live in reality
98697 even a full grown lion has been known to be no match for a full grown
98698 it the tiger was more cunning and powerful than the lion and therefore it killed off or drove the lion away from the areas it occupied
98699 then the tiger came down from the north from siberia and manchuria and the lion slowly began to lose ground before that more active animal
98700 if tigers arrived in india later than lions as is possible then there is every probability that they were the containing factor

98728 male lions display their greatest ca pacity for teamwork while ousting invaders the situation that presents the greatest threat to their common self interest at night the males patrol their territory claiming their turf with a se ries of loud roars whenever we broadcast tape recordings of a strange male roaring within a coalitions territory the response was immediate they searched out the speaker and would even attack a stuffed lion that we occasionally set beside it by conducting dozens of these experiments our graduate student jon grinnell found that unrelated companions were as cooperative as brothers and that partners would approach the speaker even when their companions could not monitor their actions indeed the males responses sometimes bordered on suicidal approaching the speaker even when they were outnumbered by three recorded lions to one

98742 the romans notably had occasion to admire in flesh and bone in their circus games species much fiercer and larger than the european bear
98743 question why then did the romans always use the lion as the symbol of their coat of arms and in their flags during wars and battles to strike fear in the enemy and not the
98744 its looks not fighting skills talk about joke is true
98745 braveheart lions share e t c attributed to it it is its unbelievable level of courage fighting and win all warrior skills
98746 the romans were exceptionally advanced in science architecture medicine exploration and also knew a thing or two about animal fighting
98747 sorry the fact that lions have historically defeated tigers has never even been in dispute until usually people from the orient started coming up with their own versions of
98748 fights between lions and tigers have been staged the tiger always wins
98749 there is no doubt that in one on one combat
98750 the lion would lose the bengal tiger on average weighs about five hundred fifty pounds a one hundred pound weight advantage
98751 so is the lion of africa wrongly styled the king of beasts because another cat the tiger is bigger fifty pounds heavier and has mastered the lion on many occasions notably in the days when such creaturs were matched in battle in the roman arenas
98752 most naturalists are agreed that the average lion is no match for the average tiger being not only generally smaller but much slower and more clumsy in his movements
98753 in england we have generally been taught to consider the lion as the king of the forest but to convince me of this would be a difficult task as i have frequently been an eye witness of the strength fierceness and agility of the tiger to which the lion in these qualities is much inferior
98754 animal facts and feats a guinness record of the animal kingdom
98755 a tigress in a menagerie at birmingham seized a lion by the throat and killed it in a few minutes
98756 animal facts and feats a guinness record of the animal kingdom
98757 two staged fights were mentioned the tiger won both the tiger gripped the lion with both forepaws rolled it over on its back and then began tearing indiscriminately with both teeth and hind claws making no particular effort to reach its rivals mane protected throat
98758 lion against tiger an extraordinary combat in which the king of the beasts was vanquished in a battle to the death
98759 the descent of man and selection in relation to sex 1871
98760 in 1857 a tiger at bromwich broke into the cage of a lion and a fearful scene ensued the lions mane saved his neck and head from being much injured but the tiger at last succeeded in ripping up his belly and in a few minutes he was dead
98761 in the middle ages a few lions were kept in european menageries in germany england france and italy the best known of these early zoological collections was one belonging to henry i of england that was eventually moved to the tower of london where it remained until 1840 occasionally lions where forced to fight tigers but apparently the tigers always won
98762 occasional fights were also staged between lion and tiger the tiger always won or wolves and bull the wolves always won if in health by attacking the
98763 they have accidentally got into each others cages and the tiger has killed the lion
98764 feats of strength are authenticated of the tiger to which the lion can on evidence lay no claim and of the courage before man the evidence is all on
98765 a tiger is a better fighter than a lion as far as i can discover there is only one instance on record of a lion beating a tiger
98766 the lion is a less active animal than the tiger and apparently not so powerful in every case of a fight between the two occurring in a menagerie the tiger has invariably killed his opponent
98767 george stubbs the most famous and original animal painter of his time who was just reaching his peak in 1759 liked to display combats of lion versus tiger though he did not commit the egregious mistake made in james wards animal pictures painted later in the century where the lion symbolizes britain and the tiger india in reality as we know very clearly from the obscene animal fights staged by the ancient romans in the arena the tiger would win in such a sight every time
98768 the clash between the lion and the tiger invariably ends in a victory for the striped beast
98769 in the records of the roman arena we found that the tiger was usually victorious in such a combat
98770 in fights between a tiger and a lion in the wild the tiger is usually the winner
98771 they are natural and deadly enemies and the lions were killed off almost at once when they entered tigers preserves
98772 and in a personal contest the tiger would generally have the advantage over a lion
98773 in fair fight the royal tiger would be certain to come off conqueror for he is even bolder and stronger than a lion
98774 but the roman emperor was determined to try whether the bengal tiger could fight the african lion and martial records that the tigers and lions fought and that the tigers always beat the lions
98775 to this may be added the testimony of martial from actual observation of the contests in the arenas where the tigers always killed their antagonists
98776 martial also states that the tigers always killed the lions in the amphitheatre the lion is in truth a pretentious humbug and owes his reputation to his imposing mane
98777 the tiger in the east indies is more powerful than any met with in other parts of the world it is the undisputed master of the indian forest indeed the royal tiger of bengal is more than a match for the asiatic lion a british officer who resided many years at sierra leone was repeatedly a spectator of combats between the lion and the tiger in which the latter was universally victorious
98778 it would appear from the most correct accounts that the lion is hardly a match for this formidable creature the tiger is as beautiful as dreadful
98779 the tiger if in good condition invariably kills the lion when compelled to fight
98780 the tiger immediately attacked the lion catching him by the throat and in a few minutes killed him this same tiger is i believe still being exhibited in edmondss menagerie
98781 many of the foregoing facts leave no doubt of the greater ferocity and courage of the tiger as compared with the lion can be equally little question of his greater strength which has been shown by houghton to be only 69 9 per cent for the fore limb and 65 9 per cent for the hind limb in the lion
98782 the lion while usually termed the king of beasts is inferior to the bengal tiger in strength and endurance and the title properly belongs to that species
98783 it is moreover unlikely that an indian lion could contend with the tiger as it is much inferior in size and strength
98784 the same tiger is also celebrated for his battle with a lion resulting in the death of the latter the two creatures had been put into one large cage or box which was divided by a partition in the centre so as to separate the two animals while the attendants were
98785 he mentions a case in which a tiger in a menagerie burst through the partition of his den into a lions and in a few minutes killed him
98786 the answer is that there would be one dead lion
98787 if an adult male tiger and an adult male lion were to fight the tiger would win hands down it has far superior strength and ability contrary to popular belief the tiger is the true king of the jungle
98788 alfred court another famous wild animal trainer had three enormous siberian tigers at one time but he was afraid to put them in a mixed group with lions and other animals for fear there would be a massacre instead he used them in a tiger act with four bengal tigers but even then he said he was always terrified they would attack their smaller relatives
98789 q can 1 tiger beat a lion in a fight a the tiger is a better fighter than a lion and dr roy chapman andrews has stated that there is only one instance on record where a lion beat a tiger
98790 that the typical tiger is a fiercer fighter than the typical lion is common knowledge less widely known is what gives that tiger the advantage simple thing the lion stands on three paws to maul with the fourth but the tiger balances itself on its hind legs to maul with both front paws simultaneously moment by moment the fighting paws on the tigers side generally out number the fighting paws on the lions side by two to one
98791 ancient roman arena where lion versus tiger fights were often staged for the gratification of the crowds in most of these combats the tiger emerged the winner
98792 in the wild it has to fiercely compete with buffalos bull elephants crocs zebras black mambas oryx hyenas hippos leopards wilderbeasts rhinos and other male lions
98793 its looks not fighting skills talk about joke is true
98794 you could also argue that maybe romans did not pit lions against tigers
98795 you could also argue that maybe romans did not pit lions against tigers
98796 do you believe a tiger can take down one of these below
98797 right before your accusation you even went on as many tiger fans do when their
98798 sure your references seem to come from western writers but it doesnt mean they do not have
98799 really we could each go back and forth with posting as many references as possible that support our stances posting a thousand more than me wont necessarilly mean you are right
98800 theres too much bs here by tiger fans ill fight for the lion which is the only true king
98801 in truth there are no written records of which animals won the most theres only tradition and tradition points to the lion as the king of animals as they put it
98802 clyde beatty favors lion and thats huge because hes the man that set them up in fights and have seen them fight
98803 theres too much bs here by tiger fans ill fight for the lion which is the only true king
98804 anonym tigers did not win most of the fight during roman times as a matter of fact that bs was started by william mann who wrote an article about it for smithsonian it was pure bs because mann studies insects in relation to agriculture he was also the chairman of that institute he was a tigerfan true and true the guy has stuff tigers in his den and once a year he goes to india to hunt tigers
98805 in truth there are no written records of which animals won the most theres only tradition and tradition points to the lion as the king of animals as they put it

98809 the writer is under obligation to mr thomas henry who has dug out historical facts and otherwise added to the manuscript our mr blackburne has written down some of the tales so well known to his friends and these are included mr baker has contributed several accounts drawn from his experience of many years with the zoo mr gerrit s miller jr dr charles w richmond and miss doris cochran have given freely of their time and expert knowledge to insure the correctness of the scientific nomenclature throughout the book mr john r ellingston has read and edited the manuscript and given helpful advice in its preperation
98810 you are correct the average female lion and tiger are essentially the same size as are male lions and tigers indeed they are so similar that when you look at a skinned carcass it is almost impossible to tell whether it is a lion or a tiger without examining the skull closely the tiger being the largest of the living felids comes from the old records of siberian tigers that supposedly weighed 700 pounds see heptner and sludski captive siberians tend to grow to that size and more lions not so much all the best mel sunquist sunquist melvin e
98811 also 22 lions measured would present a much more conservative figure than would seven
98812 male cubs seem to grow faster and learn to kill on their own more quickly than females when the roaring tigress and tiger 104 were both 18 months old she weighed 250 lbs and her brother was 100 lbs heavier
98813 the next few hours were filled with activity amp anxiety while mel and 5 shikaris struggled to raised the tiger off the ground i read the weight from the gauge he was a big animal weighing 440 lbs nearly beyond the capacity of the scale

98816 the tiger being the largest of the living felids comes from the old records of siberian tigers that supposedly weighed 700 pounds see heptner and sludski captive siberians tend to grow to that size and more lions not so much
98817 comparing the largest of tigers with small lions does little to prove your statements and you completely missed the point
98818 most people weigh less than 200 lbs but decidedly more than 100 the average of which being 150 lbs in the book the human body it states the average person to posses of muscle mass of about 40 or 60 lbs of muscle most people can t lift twice their weight which in this case is 300 lbs but decidedly more than 200 the average of which being 250 and which by chance is about 4 times greater than the amount of muscle used
98819 most ppl weigh more than 100lbs but less than 300lbs i am not wrong bcos most ppl weigh less than 300lbs also then the avg wt would be 200lbs muscle mass would be 80lbs
98820 if as damon says a lion is equal in size to tigers you would have thought that with such a vast amount of lions and such easy access to them open plains you would more often than not find lions weighing in the region of the average 220kg tiger and frequently come across lions that hit 250 kg
98821 this is another high risk period in a tigers life in fact most transients nomadic in lion terms perish some are shot poisoned others get injured while hunting dangerous prey fighting with other tigers and starve to death
98822 the mortality rates for female and male transients r estimated to be as high as 30 for females and 35 for males per year
98823 competetion among male breeders is more severe and as a result male tenures are much short 3 to 4 years among breeding tigers in a population annual mortality rates are estimated at 5 for females and 15 for males
98824 tigers being lone predators hate fighing bcos fighting according to them is a bad idea and stuff
98825 i found tigers prefered larger species such as gaur and sambar and killed disproportationly more of them then in comparison to the more abundant chital
98826 lions are the troublemakers the most dangerous when the public sees the cats they always think the tiger is the worst because a tiger looks bad he looks sneaky but the male lion of the big cats is the worst the male lion has a pride hes in charge of a group of females until another male lion runs him off it could be its own son but the female lion is under domination she may make the kill the male lion comes down to eat and then the females can eat it doesnt work that way in humans but it does work that way in animals
98827 theres only three ways a tiger can beat a lion 1 if its too young 2 if its too old 3 if its starving to death
98828 salmoni started off likely tigers and seeing them as winners but after he witness a couple of fights between lions and tigers he started rethinking after animal face off he changed heart watch animal face off and listen how he sides with the tigers beating the lions
98829 dave hoover a big cat tamer and specialist said in the beginning that tigers would win against lion but later change position after witnessing a brawl between the two the lion was the winner
98830 lions are the troublemakers the most dangerous when the public sees the cats they always think the tiger is the worst because a tiger looks bad he looks sneaky but the male lion of the big cats is the worst the male lion has a pride hes in charge of a group of females until another male lion runs him off it could be its own son but the female lion is under domination she may make the kill the male lion comes down to eat and then the females can eat it doesnt work that way in humans but it does work that way in animals
98831 tigers have far superior teeth to those of the other members of the big cat family including the lion leopard and jaguar not only do they have a sharpened peg of a tooth but their teeth narrow down to a razor sharp edge at the back making the tigers bite much more lethal armed with these incredible teeth tigers are able to bring down prey as large a grizzly bears rhinocerous and even small elephants and they do this all on their own lions are able to hunt large prey but they usually have to do it in groups called prides
98832 there r countless more sources reporting lions over a 1000lbs
98833 on avg both lions and tigers weigh 416lbs dont listen to old sites or books which states the opp as it has been proven that tigers arent as big as ppl once believed
98834 if i truly thought tigers r bigger i would glaldy admit it however i just dont see it i have seen lions that were bigger than tigers and vice versa so whos to say which is larger
98835 any reports of nepal tiger weighing over 227kgs is most likely estimates

98917 all the kinds of things you take for granted from an online media perspective you cant do on tv you want to change out an ad it takes days you want to change weighting or targeting and switch to a different type of audience its pretty difficult it was my one foray into the tv space after spending 10 years online and i felt ready to come back
98918 its certainly a challenging advertising market for some right now my assumption is that many papers are largely selling to local advertisers what quadrantone offers is the ability to take their local content these audience and the ability to localize the message for national advertisers and national advertisers get this type of media youre talking about people checking out local news i dont have the data in front of me but the engagement on these sites is substantially higher that will make a difference
98919 were going to continue with what i consider to be an intelligent affiliate strategy the best thing i can do with my time and as we expand the business is bring on more national advertisers were going to double the size of the ad sales team within the next four to six weeks keep in mind this is a company thats only 140 days old so theres only five or six sales people 10 altogether including support the way it works is the better i do for my affiliates the more affiliates ill ultimately have
98920 look how smart we are to negotiate such a splendid arrangement

98934 i am issuing the sternest warning possible to my fellow jews as well as all americans who love their country and their brothers and sisters in israel
98935 barack obama has only the most superficial knowledge about israel and the middle east and the advisers he has hired so called experts appear to have learned nothing from the history of this war infected region his trip to israel is nothing more than a campaign ploy to make him appear to have expertise on an issue of which he is pathetically ignorant
98936 this will cause the west bank to become a base for international terrorism and a launching pad for bombing israeli towns such as sderot which has caused the town to be depopulated a withdrawal will trigger a flow of arms into these areas that will result in every city and military base in israel to be within range of even the most rudimentary arab missiles when that happens i dont believe barack obama will defend israel
98937 that senator obama should be a serious candidate for president of the united states is shocking to a person like me who has written extensively on americas founding fathers i see obama as a danger not only to israel but ultimately to america as well i therefore urge all americans do not be deceived by this cunning smooth talking and inexperienced politician whose agenda will endanger the two nations i love israel and america

98966 i think we should abandon all discussion of what islam truly is
98967 clearly for lots of muslims islam is not a doctrine of gentleness tolerance sexual equality forgiveness democracy and all the rest for countless others it clearly is what follows inescapably from this
98968 is that religious people and their views should not be officially recognized in groups religion should not be allowed a public space or public representation

99043 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
99044 but you know i still like our chances its a nice bat to put in their lineup but good pitching always beats good hitting weve been able to pitch well theyve been able to pitch well hopefully we can pitch better than they can
99045 we havent played a real game since june 9 so having to play a team as good as sunnyside in the opener believe me that wasnt the way we would have liked to have done it

99054 everything seems ok except when he really opens it up
99055 were going to get him checked out with an mri just to make sure theres nothing going on in there that we dont know about but i think its getting closer and hopefully by this weekend well be able to really test it out
99056 theyre probably thinking thats a first baseman playing out there
99057 in a situation like that it takes a perfect throw
99058 a great throw thats the game right there hes done an unbelievable job filling in out there for a guy with as little reps as hes had
99059 manny is one of the best hitters of his generation
99060 after a long and careful study it was clear it was not the same people giving the sample
99061 we love defense as a team because we have a lot of guys who can get at it defensively cause some havoc and make a lot of plays
99062 he passed the ball well played great defense ran the lanes he played like lebron james
99063 the best was lebron james who made a big difference
99064 i think the first quarter was an adjustment period for us we were getting used to what they were running what their sets were
99065 the second quarter we did a much better job of locking in and taking those away
99066 whether it was the right decision or wrong decision it is a decision i made

99097 it is further disheartening that government has unilaterally targeted a single industry with this huge development without providing any notice let alone consultation with the industry

99106 che la tua lettera al direttore generale su una presunta estrema difficolt a relazionarti con me basata ad ogni evidenza su presupposti smentiti in atti

99108 sta pensando di lanciare in pista per il dopo veltroni qualche nome nuovo qualcuno che rappresenti un cambio generazionale e che non provenga dalla storia del pci e dei ds per esempio un emiliano come pierluigi bersani ma diverso per et e origine filippo andreatta
99109 si utilizzata unidea innovativa quella di un partito allamericana per rilegittimare vizi antichi e tipicamente italiani invece che per innescare quel processo di cambiamento radicale che i cittadini chiedevano un cinismo che pu rasentare lipocrisia che ha contribuito ad allontanare molti elettori dal pd
99110 veltroni potrebbe mantenere la leadership abbandonando per la pretesa di essere per forza il prossimo candidato alle elezioni potrebbe cos dedicarsi libero da condizionamenti a costruire una coalizione in grado di battere il centrodestra e un partito nuovo in cui le vecchie nomenklature lascino il posto a una nuova non solo anagraficamente classe dirigente

99124 this has always been one of the tougher teams to play against in my career
99125 and so now to be on the other side of that and cause havoc for everyone else is definitely a positive for me
99126 i know that this is deron williams team theres no question about that hes worked to get himself in that position and hes a great player in this league hopefully i can come here and continue to push him continue to make him a better player

99135 i find it presumptuous when i book a makeover and see fifteen products piled high when im done
99136 sometimes its the people behind the counter who are too pushy sometimes there are customers who totally take advantage of the free services and walk off empty handed deliberately
99137 and the need for consumers to understand they really should not take advantage of these people is equally real
99138 i want you to come back i want you to be happy i want to try things on you that you are going to love and if it doesnt work for you in the long run it really doesnt work for me
99139 i really dont want my staff spending an hour doing a makeup application if all you need or plan on buying is a blush or a lip gloss
99140 looking for a face full of makeup because they are going to a special event like a wedding but who leave looking great and buy nothing
99141 so if you spent 40 minutes with an artist i recommend you spend at least 40
99142 i would be out of business in a day if my customers spent a dollar a minute when they sat down for a makeover
99143 i dont think its reasonable to take that much of anyones time and walk away for the price of a lip gloss and mascara it might fly in other parts of the country but not here and since my staff works on commission it really isnt considerate of their time
99144 say you come in asking for a blush we may put other things on you so you leave the store looking finished
99145 if we do it voluntarily things can go awry when customers come to the counter with a secret agenda a free coat of chin toforehead sic color to wear to a date or wedding that day if i know that and im not busy i might be happy to do that if we have a relationship or if you say upfront i only plan on spending this much that is helpful but please dont try to put one over on the makeup lady
99146 be realistic about how you use cosmetics know your routine know how much youre willing to expand or change your repertoire
99147 im a big believer in free will you can walk away
99148 if you hate foundation never wear it dont buy it and blame it on the people behind the counter when you do thats not fair dont buy it if you have it already or are not going to use it
99149 weve found in those categories there is a lot of stuff in the mid range that is excellent
99150 everyone needs to have a professional work with them on getting their base right
99151 i may put on some shadow and liner to balance you out but if i do i do it knowing your intentions so i wont feel put out if you dont buy the extras
99152 tell the artist if they have time and its a slow day they may help you out you will establish a relationship and it can be good for everyone
99153 please at least buy a lip gloss it is unfair the leave empty handed
99154 it helps an artist to know how they can serve you better next time
99155 we are happy to provide them if we have them samples of some things like blush or eyeshadow are not usually available but we love to offer them for things such as foundation and moisturizer
99156 i would like to wear this for a while to test it
99157 if you are not buying and an artist is working with you make sure you call other customers to their attention
99158 it is not fair to keep her from a potential sale if you are just having fun

99227 when i invented the bearing isolator back in 1975 the industrial community considered it to be a novelty and as such it was widely misunderstood today times have changed as plants know that the maintenance repair and operations of equipment used on the plant floor are vital areas that can be controlled and improved
99228 realizing that the product falls into a best maintenance practice category most of the fortune 500 companies in the process industries and over half of the worlds industrial companies use authentic inpro seal products in critical maintenance roles inpro seal bearing isolators have gone on to be enthusiastically accepted by almost four million end users and have become a standard component in process pumps and electric motors around the world
99229 in 1975 the bearing isolator was new and innovative it still is innovative though we have received over 40 additional patents most are modifications or enhancements of the original the basic product remains the same a good example is the articulating air mizer ps a shaft sealing system that replaces dry running contact seals the air mizer has contributed heavily to our record breaking production levels because it provides a non contacting positive seal that previous sealing methods simply cannot attain

99238 i work on the computer for long hours and i have started slouching im very young to start doing that the shoulder brace certainly met my expectations and now provides me with great support
99239 after making the decision to create the tattoo sourcebook i immediately began researching studios and websites that had access to different tattoo designs
99240 i spoke to tattoofinder com owner lou bardach and he thought the sourcebook concept as i presented it was a fantastic idea but it wasnt enough he wanted to give an authoritative and informative introduction to the tattoo process and he couldnt have been more right nearly 2 000 designs and 40 different artists later the tattoo sourcebook was born
99241 we approach these collaborative efforts first and foremost by focusing on our customers needs
99242 we then look for innovative ways to leverage our assets and build mutually beneficial relationships with other companies oftentimes valuing our long term goals over short term monetary gains
99243 our decision to work with tattoofinder was based on the incredible volume of traffic their site generates
99244 as well as their solid ethical reputation as the leading source for high quality tattoo designs it takes time for a newer company to build a strong presence on the web and doing so generally requires a huge advertising budget we felt working with tattoofinder com in co branded content distribution was a good move for both parties we look forward to finding other creative ways to work together to enhance each others brand extend our reach and increase industry authority
99245 the secret to our success is giving our visitors exactly what they want in the most clear direct way possible
99246 what our customers want is great tattoo artwork and reliable information and my mission is to make this experience as easy and effective as possible its not some kind of seo trick or backroom dealings with search engines like google in fact its the exact opposite philosophy thats made us successful honesty tattoofinder com has become synonymous with top quality tattoo artwork and authoritative information about the tattoo process simply because thats what we offer nothing more nothing less
99247 just as actual tattoos have moved beyond bikers and soldiers to rock stars and actors iconic tattoo imagery has gained influence just as aggressively
99248 our artwork is a powerhouse resource not only as tattoo friendly reference to get inked but also for merchandise friendly advertising friendly and promotion friendly tattoo images while people fanatically tattoo their skin businesses are equally enthusiastic about tattooing clothing electronic devices advertising campaigns and sometimes their company identity

99250 we could have simply licensed artwork to harpercollins for the tattoo sourcebook
99251 but we saw an opportunity to work with them more closely to produce and promote a truly epic book we could have simply sold advertising space to inked magazine on our website but saw opportunity in the magazines high end print market we took a creative approach in both cases toward building solid long term business relationships that have benefited us benefited our partners and most importantly benefited our customers

99258 its natural to attribute healing to a doctor or a miracle drug
99259 but the lesson from hezekiah is that if you pray to god for healing and ask others to pray for you as well then god should receive the credit the healed by god pendant isnt just for practicing jews and christians its for everyone who is willing to acknowledge that theyve been healed through the power of prayer

99263 there really werent many opportunities for people to redeem themselves we wanted to see success stories but we faced overcrowded courtrooms budget crisis staff shortages as well as skepticism from judges and attorneys to give persons charged with crimes a second chance
99264 someone needed to inspire a change to wake the system up and really focus on developing alternatives for the court system
99265 the success of one of my clients has the effect of giving the next client more consideration for an alternative program by the court and prosecutor this is something i try to emphasize to each client that someone else in the future may get that second chance based on their success in this program
99266 in the short term these states may not receive the relief on which many of them are counting particularly from increased spending as a result of the federal economic stimulus checks
99267 the slowdown in the housing market and recession fears have resulted in reduced sales tax collections in each of these states
99268 states are hoping that the 100 billion in stimulus checks from the federal government will help bring buyers back into the market and increase revenue collected from sales tax
99269 people and corporations are not spending which means less sales tax revenue
99270 tennessee is one of the very few states that have actually seen an increase in their sales tax revenue base over the last year
99271 with the budget shortfalls these states are facing i would not be surprised to see others consider raising their state wide sales tax rates
99272 the common denominator in all of these states budget cuts is the reduced sales tax collections
99273 the difference between this economic downturn and the one in 2001 2002 is that the current downturn has had its most profound effect on housing and durable goods not stocks and investments as in the prior downturn
99274 companies are cutting costs and trying to squeeze out profits so they are not entering into the same amount of capital intensive projects they were several years ago
99275 if people opt for taking a vacation with this money
99276 these states are not going to see the uptick in sales tax collections for which they are hoping as citizens may be spending that money in other places like disney world or las vegas states that are pinning their hopes to this increased spending may be disappointed
99277 a large portion of state sales tax revenue is collected from corporations not individuals until businesses open their checkbooks again and the economy is expanding states will likely not find the relief they need from these budget woes

99288 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
99289 john mccain is simply not a relevant variable in this election
99290 this careening from message to message makes them look like they dont have one specific thing they want to say about this guy and that there is no centralized theme there is no centralized message
99291 he doesnt seem to have anything positive to say about me does he
99292 you need to ask john mccain what hes for not just what hes against

99313 i would like to congratulate the winners in the commercial sector for the steps they have taken to continue delivering quality solutions to builders and contractors
99314 the highly competitive high risk nature of construction is causing contractors to make useful and accurate analysis and reporting a top priority

99321 we want the world to understand that we abhor this despicable crime
99322 we have found some of the stories reported in certain areas of the press insensitive untrue and have added to our distress
99323 science based startups traditionally have a difficult time communicating the scope and value of their research
99324 the material is complex and the potential applications and value are difficult to demonstrate emerging firms lack the internal resources they need for communications and founders lack the time because they are often still conducting bench research developing technology and running their company
99325 young businesses that are focused on research have not had access to the same tools that larger firms have
99326 in our 25 years of working with leading research groups weve developed an innovative process and extensive network that helps us provide companies with professional communications tools in an extremely cost effective way

99328 all year employees look forward to taking their families on summer vacations unfortunately because of the cost of gas the rising cost of airfare and the weakening us dollar many americans are forced to either visit local attractions or take no vacation at all its been proven that taking time off from work actually increases productivity organizations looking to appease their employees and increase efficiency should utilize corvests promotional products to encourage their staff to take a break and relax
99329 these items will not only serve to encourage employees to participate in recreational activities and to relax but theyll serve as an advertising medium for the companies who order them theyll be able to spread their companys message or increase brand recognition at picnics parks beaches and other local attractions the small investment required for promotional products will really pay off in the end

99339 they had a need to reduce cables and provide resilience in what can only be described as a large field before the build this allowed us to showcase our satellite broadband solution which when combined with the wireless mesh system produces a platform that eradicates the need for multiple ground based cables previously they had the usual problems running cables across fields on a very busy site with exhibitors and traffic which can damage cables in the build therefore causing a breakdown in the service at various points throughout the ten days
99340 zultys couldnt be more pleased that our u k partners have chosen such a prestigious outdoor event to fully demonstrate the robust integration capabilities and flexibility of our mx communications system we wish all of the eisteddfod participants in wales all the best as they celebrate their welsh heritage and we hope the mx powered network will be music to their ears

99344 and i congratulate everyone who has helped make cpo the choice for leading brands and customers worldwide
99345 we are calling for revolutionary change in our nations animal shelter practices and policies
99346 most people believe shelters exist to protect animals tragically the reverse is often the case the institutional killing of cats in animal pounds and shelters is the leading documented cause of death for cats in the united states
99347 that is why we are mobilizing the public and working to fix our broken sheltering system
99348 curtis lumber and mcdonald brothers deserve recognition for their ability to sustain growth build relationships and service their customers
99349 they both have tremendous history dating back to the 19th century and both have been equally successful in earning the respect of their peers today
99350 without a doubt the main reason for our award is the longevity and efforts of our great group of employees
99351 ive been on paddling expeditions throughout canada to india tahiti peru ecuador and elsewhere but our journey down the la river was probably the most exotic and mind blowing of them all i tried three different craft in the la river whitewater kayak sit on top kayak and canoe and the simple canoe trumped them all
99352 we found that even at this driest time of year you can float a boat down the whole river we also saw that the river has all the requisite physical characteristics of a traditional navigable waterway suitable hydrology depth configuration and flow ample access points and paths evidence of public use etc and that the river has enormous potential for commercial activities birdwatching fishing painting etc this is especially true of the 7 mile stretch of class i rapids in the soft bottomed glendale narrows many people in riverside neighborhoods like atwater village expressed interest in boating tours via small watercraft
99353 unfortunately the rivers potential is limited by corps and county claims that the public doesnt have a right to its own river which runs contrary to california state law article 10 section 4 of its constitution its practically criminal to charge onerous fees to the public for something the public already has a fundamental right to access somebody should look into that
99354 the corps did waive film permit fees at the last minute but still says that boats mustnt touch water next year we hope we can include the corps and county as willing partners colonel magness in the river with a canoe now that would be a fantastic day for the entire la river community
99355 it was a real kick sure there were a few short portages around shopping carts and some rock ledges but there were also waterlines on the channel walls indicating that water is 6 12 inches higher during other times of the year obviously you wouldnt want to mess with this river when its raining or when there are thunderstorms in the foothills but by and large it was a pleasurable surreal urban odyssey full of human nature and other wildlife our permits were originally denied due to safety concerns but the biggest danger we encountered was slipping on algae exacerbated by all that hot concrete
99356 when we transitioned from concrete lined sections to natural ones at the beginning of the sepulveda basin the glendale narrows and the estuary at willow street in long beach there were brief stretches where plants and soil were working overtime to uptake the pollutants and everything would smell unbelievably rank but after 20 yards it would start to balance out nature would prevail and you could start to imagine yourself anywhere but here in l a its really a pretty extraordinary fun experience
99357 americans are sick and tired of paying high gas prices driving to grocery stores and paying high food prices too
99358 theyre tired of high energy prices so theyre turning to home based farming and its paying off
99359 you use hydroponics nutrients to pump up the yield quality and taste of your home crops
99360 you can grow year round using outdoor gardens in warmer weather and indoor gardening during winter that way youve got a supply of fresh fruits and vegetables 365 days a year youve also got a fun hobby that the whole family can engage in
99361 you dont have to spend several dollars per gallon driving somewhere to buy your food thats one big benefit
99362 you get total control over the quality of what you eat because you grow it yourself you get a higher yield than with regular gardening and its a form of self sufficiency
99363 youre going to see more and more americans turning to home gardening as a survival tool
99364 prices for petroleum food gasoline and energy are going way up and theyll keep going up pretty soon its going to be a matter of necessity that you have your own garden so you can ensure a continuous supply of healthy fruits and vegetables for your family
99365 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
99366 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
99367 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
99368 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
99369 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
99370 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
99371 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
99372 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
99373 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
99374 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
99375 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
99376 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
99377 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
99378 but what is really sad is that there are no good child care options for families since the modern work place pretends that children dont matter mothers have to get creative
99379 veritable encyclopedia of common sense wisdom a modern day 95 theses nailed to the pre school door
99380 my book gives moms some irreverent but real advice having a fake purse is a twisted solution but if the working world is going to pretend i dont have kids i say we have to find ways to work around it its not the best solution but desperate times call for desperate measures
99381 if you like your kids peanut butter sandwich fried and then dunked in fluff or made from specially picked organic peanuts crushed individually by fully unionized workers youll love the white trash mom handbook by michelle lamar i aspire to the life lessons here especially how to fake it for the bake sale
99382 take it from a yellow trash dad that the white trash mom handbook is a book that you should read actually you dont have to read it just buy it michelle will be just as happy either way as would i be
99383 buy it for your sister in law who gives you the stink eye every time you give your kid an unthawed eggo buy it for the woman in your mommy and me group who makes you feel like crap for not making your 3 year old go to violin french juggling lessons and send another copy to the bitchy chick down the street the white trash mom handbook is not about money or status or education its about giving yourself the freedom to be yourself and that is a good thing indeed
99384 michelle lamars irreverent handbook is a must read for all mothers
99385 helps kids keep up with schoolwork or prepare for the next grade

99391 newsblues regularly reports on each of the television stations corresponding to domain names i purchased
99392 station call letters are decreasingly part of a web domain
99393 today u s tv stations rarely refer to themselves by their station call letters the value of a dot tv domain is reduced to little more than a domain forward and as a result the value is extremely diminished
99394 we have over 600 brands to protect including our callsigns and stations may end up using their call letters more and more instead of their channel numbers
99395 we cant afford to let these domains fall into the wrong hands
99396 the power of the tv extension is in part that tv means the same thing to people in china as it does to people in spain or the united states

99404 thats why weve done all the research so our customers can have a huge head start in the business and really focus on the other aspects of buying and selling
99405 historians have noted the preparation of chicken based meals in cultures as early as 3200 b c some note its presence in ancient rome egypt greece and even asia with such early worldwide appeal no wonder its a food that has such international flair maybe thats one of the reasons why our new line of chicken entrees is so worldly
99406 more than twenty eight years of all natural goodness may only seem like a small portion of time when compared to civilizations dating back over five thousand years but were very proud of the difference weve made since we opened the doors at cedarlane we respond quickly to consumers ever changing lifestyles and eating habits we pride ourselves on our creativity and our ability to be on the forefront of innovation

99429 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
99430 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients

99437 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
99438 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
99439 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
99440 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

99473 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
99474 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
99475 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
99476 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
99477 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
99478 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
99479 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself

99481 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

99484 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
99485 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
99486 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
99487 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
99488 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
99489 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

99639 we insist on being as close to our customers as we physically can be and so we develop real partnerships and work as a team
99640 this is so important to enable us to continually raise the bar in terms of levels of quality and delivery performance equally important to us are our key suppliers without them we would not be able to provide the right product at the right cost and the right quality especially as we deliver most of our products on a fully sequenced basis
99641 we source product from suppliers both within australia and internationally
99642 having competitive suppliers who we can build productive innovative and long term relationships with is critical to our business and to ensuring effective supply chains many of the suppliers are also involved with us throughout the design and validation phases of the program so we have been working together for a number of years to make sure that new models such as the fg falcon are a success
99643 for us its about being flexible and agile so that we can best support our customers needs its also about ensuring that the products we supply genuinely enhance comfort safety and convenience for the consumer

99654 i made every attempt to break each process into simple steps so that anyone can put these techniques to work
99655 whats the use of a sales book if all you get is the why but not the how
99656 it consolidated its operations into state based distribution centers that were custom designed for the range of products being handled these centers were constructed with the latest innovations in space utilisation for improved density of storage the best in materials handling equipment computer controlled order picking and shipping and the right staffing to bring these elements together in harmony
99657 from the lg factories overseas using global partners to handle inbound shipments through to the final delivery of product into a consumers house by our local home delivery team every link in the supply chain is as important as every other
99658 it has been critically important to make the selection of partners as rigorous a process as possible ensuring only the suppliers with the highest standards are considered as partners then once an agreement is reached working with our partners towards delivering exceptional service becomes a commitment from both parties only by having an ongoing dialogue of an open and frank nature can both parties benefit if issues arise as they sometimes do even in the best of partnerships the environment has been created where these issues can be brought to the table in a non threatening way so that they can be resolved the important aspect of these partnerships is that both parties agree on the direction of continued improvement this being the only way to stay ahead of the competition
99659 we have partnered with two of the biggest and best names in the transport industry in australia to deliver on our promise of on time delivery in perfect condition to our customers
99660 to maximize the density of storage has necessitated the use of single double deep and multi deep drive through storage bays with differing height bays to accommodate pallets of differing needs
99661 these are all relatively standard configurations available but we have also worked together to engineer solutions outside the norm for high density storage of refrigerators for example we have developed extra wide pallets and storage bays that can return 50 greater storage density than conventional bulk storage by utilizing the height of the racking to extend the vertical stacking capabilities these are australian firsts in storage density innovations now being marketed in areas where storage density is important and space availability is critically lacking the transport needs to always be a high quality materials handling needs to be considerate of the product and packaging the return on every dollar spent needs to be maximized at every opportunity by working with our suppliers to set up the right environment creates the framework to base the business on
99662 what may have been industry best practice last year may not be appropriate this year and we need to change to keep pace innovation is key to progress and success
99663 total customer satisfaction and safety are two very important elements of industrial galvanizers strategic objectives
99664 and how we manage our suppliers aids us in achieving our targets for these two important strategic objectives ignore your suppliers and you wont get the best out of them
99665 the australian market is extremely dynamic but we do enjoy various base load products from regular customers we work very closely with our materials handling processing consumables safety maintenance and transport suppliers to ensure the finished product exceeds the customers expectations
99666 it is imperative that supplier feedback for materials labour and transport is accurate and quick given our market is mature and competitive
99667 our primary suppliers are quite aware we are in regular contact with our secondary and sometimes tertiary suppliers this means that our suppliers are more likely to put their best price and timeframe forward so were not wasting each others time as a result we reward our suppliers for their ability to deliver on time and to a high standard of quality and safety
99668 its fair to say that we have put some of our suppliers to the test given our often hot and corrosive environment
99669 more often than not the benefits of our long term relationships with our various suppliers have meant weve got the job done on time and within budget everyone deserves a fairy godmother for a while at least
99670 it is here the relationship takes on a more formal approach in that our suppliers need to be clear on our national or local standards for supply of product and services were not mil spec but were not shooting from the hip either id like to think weve struck a comfortable balance and were not adding to the divorce rate between manufacturers and suppliers
99671 transactional requests for tender partnership joint ventures and vertical integration are all different types of business dealings that we have or different approaches to doing business mcdonalds uses all of these some every day others from time to time depending on the product market conditions and so forth

99677 we are making progress and we expect to see some significant developments over the next few years our recent switch to sourcing rainforest alliance certifiedtm coffee beans for mccafe is an exciting and important step in the right direction
99678 likewise our international fish team is currently developing sustainability standards in relation to farmed fish and is in dialogue with the marine stewardship council regarding endorsement of our programs
99679 global guidelines are in place to articulate our social responsibility efforts with suppliers and in australia we have well established programs in place to assist our suppliers to understand and meet our expectations and to monitor their progress
99680 in australia we also have specific issues relevant to our country and climate that we are working with our suppliers to address
99681 the food we serve our customers everyday is critical to the sustainability of our business among other reasons our customers keep coming back to our restaurants because they enjoy and trust the food we serve them this means the choice of food we offer the quality of our products our safety standards and our produce supply are all ongoing priorities for us at mcdonalds we have a responsibility to partner with suppliers that operate ethically and to leverage our influence as a purchaser to help shape social environmental animal welfare and food safety and quality issues ray kroc our company founder summed up the partnership approach simply as none of us are as good as all of us

99702 that is a factor and will always be a factor for me

99731 ensuring that production requirements are met satisfactorily is the main role of the supply chain group keeping boat builders working on boats is our goal and this is why we need to consistently look to improve our supply chain processes
99732 linking an integrated supply chain function with the riviera way lean manufacturing process has meant substantial improvements in the way the team manages the production function it has improved the visibility of problem areas and given us a specific framework to go forward with a continuous improvement focus
99733 many of our suppliers have a long term relationship with riviera
99734 they have grown with riviera from the time we were a relatively small company located at labrador to the current status as australias largest luxury boat builder
99735 we continually improve our forecasting and planning processes and this helps our vendors to better plan their inventory and delivery schedules the result is more on time deliveries and smoother production processes allowing riviera to concentrate resources on value adding tasks
99736 we look for suppliers who are interested in providing new products reviewing and developing supply chain processes collaborating and sharing information regardless of the simplicity or complexity of the product or service they provide
99737 we have high expectations of suppliers if we can develop ethical open and commercial relationships with suppliers we have the basic structure for strong mature partnerships
99738 most of our suppliers have worked with us for many years and understand this aspect of the fmcg industry
99739 suppliers are carefully selected for their ability to deliver consistently against demand fluctuations and contain cost during this process
99740 the supply chains are reliant on the supplier delivering quality products on time and in the right quantities for manufacture
99741 pz cussons manufacturing sites have limited storage capacity and products must arrive as and when requested in order to manage the flow of materials and goods
99742 suppliers who collaborate closely are invited to participate in innovation workshops that are focused on new product development this is an opportunity to have some fun be creative but more importantly to add significant value to pz cussons product portfolio
99743 all key suppliers work off annual technical and commercial business plans these plans detail collaborative projects bringing together the suppliers and pz cussons expertise to develop new products results of this collaboration benefit the customer consumer pz cussons and the supplier who benefits commercially through new material sales
99744 suppliers are in the business of making profit as is any business a supplier that is commercially unstable is a risk to continuity of supply the supplier will cut costs irresponsibly to survive with resulting service level drops and quality issues therefore there must be a balance between sustainable and acceptable cost the supplier must be able to consistently deliver at the quoted price and make a profit the pz cussons purchasing team ensures that prices are constantly benchmarked globally and are acceptable we work closely with our suppliers sharing benchmark data and offering them every opportunity to remain competitive in a global environment margin improvement is critical to the supply chain delivering the right cost levels working together with our suppliers on cost improvements ensures there is no threat to the future of both pz cussons and the suppliers business
99745 we find this process is effective in keeping quality and service levels high
99746 as we improve internally we find the need to raise the bar with our suppliers and we use the same process to implement these changes
99747 suppliers are crucial to success in a fast dynamic and complex supply chain when selected and managed well they are a phenomenal asset if neglected they can be our greatest liability at pz cussons we manage our suppliers with trust and respect for their commitment to our business we find that this is rewarded through affiliations that are more flexible and in step with our business requirements

99756 incentives a spark that ignites program participation engagement and results
99757 improving the health and well being of the people we serve
99758 i have several lengthy online lectures for class and textaloud works really well to help me watch my kids and listen to the lectures instead of tiring out my eyes from being glued to a screen
99759 id tried some text to speech about nine years ago but was turned off by the funny sounding cartoonish voices
99760 in this area textaloud easily saves me one to two hours a day
99761 i would definitely recommend textaloud for anyone who gets fatigue symptoms from computer time
99762 textaloud also helps me proofread my own work it especially helps when my eyes are tired but my ear readily picks up grammatical errors i would otherwise miss and sometimes helps me hear where i could reword my thoughts better too
99763 i can listen to e mails fold laundry and make sure my toddler and baby are not eating cat food or thinking that the kitty litter is a new sandbox
99764 the kids will type in funny things for the software to say and everyone laughs its been fun introducing them to this kind of technology and it gets them interested in their typing skills too
99765 i like being able to change it around to keep it from being monotonous
99766 also in those times when i feel sleepy but know i should get some reading in a higher pitched voice keeps me more alert
99767 im more productive at school and more relaxed in my home
99768 but i really knew text to speech was a valid means of communication when i found myself practically rolling on the floor laughing while listening to some entertaining anecdotal reading read aloud by the software textaloud is excellent
99769 it has been a wonderful experience being associated with balaji motion pictures in the past with shootout i really liked the concept of the film c kkompany and the way they incorporated me to introduce the 3 protagonists in the title song i enjoyed the song when i heard it and also since it was proposed by mr ramesh sippy who is like family i immediately agreed to do it this is just the beginning of our long association

99773 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
99774 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
99775 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
99776 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
99777 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
99778 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
99779 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
99780 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
99781 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
99782 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
99783 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
99784 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
99785 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
99786 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
99787 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
99788 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
99789 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
99790 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
99791 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
99792 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
99793 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
99794 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
99795 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
99796 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
99797 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
99798 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
99799 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
99800 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
99801 my husband is absolutley opposed to any negative campaigning at all
99802 the music industry is a business like any other but at the helm of this industry is a pool of artists whose work often serves as a barometer to the social and environmental challenges our society faces
99803 its a bit patronizing for us 21 year olds to try to start to change the world
99804 especially when were using enough power for 10 houses just for stage lighting itd be a bit hypocritical
99805 ill be the first to admit that the music industry has some big unavoidable emissions associated with their business
99806 with upward of 60 vehicles getting seven miles per gallon for a single national tour the impact can be pretty staggering
99807 a majority of pollution and waste associated with music tours is actually an effect of the fans themselves driving to and from shows producing waste at the shows littering in parking lots and venues using one use plastic containers for all their food and drink etc
99808 no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american public
99809 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
99810 in 10 to 12 years we will reach the tipping point
99811 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
99812 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
99813 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
99814 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
99815 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
99816 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
99817 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
99818 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
99819 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
99820 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
99821 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
99822 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
99823 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
99824 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
99825 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
99826 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
99827 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
99828 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
99829 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
99830 you know life shouldnt be hard its all about connecting and finding a reason for it
99831 how many times has she gotten me involved in things even when ive said no im not doing it
99832 its just something about jaki she has a way of talking people into doing things without them even realizing it
99833 you cant help but get sucked in shes so approachable
99834 my business is my life and im ok with that
99835 i think she would love to have a significant other an equal whos really the key person in her life
99836 she needs someone to share it with because shes accumulated so much and i dont just mean wealth
99837 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
99838 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
99839 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
99840 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
99841 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
99842 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
99843 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
99844 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
99845 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
99846 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
99847 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
99848 we can confirm that nia witts has been found safe and well in belgium
99849 just as i can learn from twente twente can learn from me i have a lot of european experience and that is why i am looking forward to the champions league qualifying round
99850 there are quite a few teams we would like to avoid that is why it is better not to look at it we will just take who we get
99851 we just have to improve now to use the two tournaments we play to get physically stronger and better then we will play who we get
99852 something which has never occurred since time immemorial a young woman did not break wind in her husbands lap
99853 s au confirmat anumite suspiciuni potrivit c rora ace tia erau sus inu i

99856 ambasadorul holbrooke i noi am spus foarte clar n repetate r nduri c nu a avut loc nici un acord n care radovan karadzici s primeasc imunitate privind acuzarea sau arestarea sa
99857 pentru a explica aceste lucruri oamenilor s i a lansat aceast poveste atunci i a esut o timp de 12 ani dar nu este nimic adev rat am depus m rturie n acest sens
99858 dac holbrooke nc m vrea mort i regret c acest tribunal nu acord pedeapsa cu moartea vreau s tiu dac are bra ul suficient de lung pentru a ajunge la mine
99859 hes the only naked man that will ever be in my bedroom
99860 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
99861 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
99862 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
99863 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
99864 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
99865 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
99866 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
99867 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
99868 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
99869 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
99870 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
99871 an oil man reacting to the largest transfer of wealth in history
99872 mr gores focus is primarily on solar wind and geothermal energy his belief is that a dramatic wholesale transition to these abundant and renewable sources of energy is not just doable but essential
99873 for years rep jay inslee d wash has been frustrated with congress inability to devise a clean energy policy so he decided to do something about it without markups or bills or committees he decided to write a book center for american progress inslee depicts an economic shift necessary to ease america into a clean energy revolution in the book which was released by island press on oct 1 2007
99874 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
99875 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
99876 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
99877 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
99878 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
99879 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
99880 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
99881 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
99882 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
99883 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
99884 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
99885 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
99886 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
99887 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
99888 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
99889 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
99890 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
99891 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
99892 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
99893 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
99894 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
99895 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
99896 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
99897 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
99898 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
99899 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
99900 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
99901 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
99902 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
99903 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
99904 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
99905 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
99906 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
99907 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
99908 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
99909 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
99910 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
99911 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
99912 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
99913 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
99914 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
99915 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
99916 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
99917 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
99918 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
99919 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
99920 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
99921 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
99922 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
99923 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
99924 if the vice president says its do able i believe
99925 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
99926 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
99927 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
99928 no se da santander realiza una emisi n de deuda por importe de 2 000 gas natural espera concluir la compra de fenosa en abril de
99929 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
99930 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
99931 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
99932 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
99933 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
99934 two canaries in the coal mine the first one is in the arctic of course the arctic ocean has a floating ice cap greenland on its side there i say canary in the coal mine because the arctic is one part of the world that is experiencing faster impact from global warming this is the largest ice shelf in the arctic the ward hunt ice shelf it just cracked in half a year ago the scientists were astonished
99935 current coastal temperatures are about 1 c below their 1940 values
99936 at the summit of the greenland ice sheet the summer average temperature has decreased at the rate of 2 2 c per decade since the beginning of the measurements in 1987
99937 colors indicate ice sheet elevation change rate in cm year from satellite altimeter data 1992 2003 the spatially averaged increase is 5 4 0 2 cm year
99938 shut off would imply repeal of the law of conservation of angular momentum widely disseminated and grossly oversimplified pictures showing the ocean as a conveyor belt have misled people into thinking ocean circulation is driven by a sinking motion at high latitudes
99939 temperature records show that the arctic was in fact warmer in the 1930s and 1940s than it is today
99940 2007 winter sea ice extent at both poles reached record highs
99941 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
99942 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
99943 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
99944 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
99945 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
99946 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
99947 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
99948 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
99949 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
99950 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
99951 climate change is the greatest environmental crisis that humanity has ever faced but it is not the only serious challenge confronting us there is a simultaneous source problem known as peak oil arising from the depletion of the fuels we are burning particularly petroleum the solution to both climate change and peak oil is to develop renewable sources of energy to use less energy to use energy differently and to make this shift as rapidly as possible
99952 al gores ambitious goal provides a national focus and call to action now whats needed is a clear sighted plan for achieving it one that recognizes the complex issues of energy depletion the vulnerability of the supply chain and the limits of technology we are taking up gores call and presenting a powerful framework to realize this vision a vision that would revitalize america and make it genuinely sustainable
99953 al gores generational challenge to repower america which places energy at the forefront of the national agenda should be the top issue debated by all candidates this fall
99954 energy touches almost every critical issue facing our country including the economy security and the environment gores courageous and rational plan to move to 100 renewable energy sources in 10 years has my full support our 10 point plan provides the stepping stones to achieve this target
99955 we thank al gore for articulating the most urgent action needed to safeguard americas environmental economic and societal future and that of the entire world our mission is to get society off of fossil fuels fast and we embrace the need to move to 100 renewable energy with this plan
99956 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
99957 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
99958 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
99959 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
99960 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
99961 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
99962 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
99963 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
99964 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
99965 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
99966 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
99967 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
99968 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
99969 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
99970 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
99971 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
99972 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
99973 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
99974 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
99975 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
99976 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
99977 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
99978 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
99979 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
99980 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
99981 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
99982 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
99983 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
99984 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
99985 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
99986 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
99987 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
99988 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
99989 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
99990 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
99991 the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
99992 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
99993 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
99994 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
99995 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
99996 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
99997 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
99998 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
99999 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
