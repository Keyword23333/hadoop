1400024 i was watching television about 11 15 and i heard a car sliding on the highway out in front of our house as i looked out the window i saw it began to flip after it hit our next door neighbors drive
1400025 it went end over end about twice and then it came back on its wheels in the ditch it was a mess
1400026 mr freeman thought he may have gone to sleep but he wasnt sure
1400027 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely

1400032 obama is a tad cooler than mccain on probably 57 fronts
1400033 obamas better looking than mccain obamas more stylish than mccain obamas more fit than mccain he refers to better music than mccain
1400034 mccain that guys not cool i just cant call mccain cool
1400035 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama
1400036 what obamas been able to do is capitalize on his hipness at least as far as younger voters go
1400037 i think its not that they dont support his issues and his policies but younger voters are more willing to work for him and work passionately for him because hes someone who resonates more on their wavelength
1400038 look at hugh hefner hell be cool til the day he dies but for him and for ron paul or anybody whos elderly and whos cool part of it is what they represent that makes them that

1400041 has a very conservative image and that doesnt really help him either

1400170 people take their application the operating system they want to run it against package it up along with policy and security they want and use that as a virtual client
1400171 the value of microsoft windows of what that product is today will diminish as more applications move to the web and microsoft needs to edge out in front of that i would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around
1400172 eighty percent of windows sales are made when a new pc is sold thats a huge amount of money for them that they do not have to go out and get if windows ends up being less important over time as applications become more os agnostic where will microsoft make its money
1400173 amid convulsing financial markets we see increasing evidence that the global economy is entering a significant slowdown period with the weakest readings to come
1400174 in asia europe and latin america while the pace differs growth is slowing virtually everywhere
1400175 the culprits spillovers from the us slowdown higher inflation reduced energy subsidies tighter monetary policies and tighter financial conditions
1400176 lets face it many other countries would love to have growth in the high single digits yes stock markets have fallen so growth may slow down a bit because if people dont have confidence they stand back but india and china are economic powerhouses and that is not changing

1400180 what commentary on civilization when being alone is being suspect when one has to apologize for it make excuses hide the fact that one practices it like a secret vice
1400181 language has created the word loneliness to express the pain of being alone and it has created the word solitude to express the glory of being alone
1400182 solitude shows us what should be society shows us what we are
1400183 i never found a companion that was so companionable as solitude we are for the most part more lonely when we go abroad among men than when we stay in our chambers
1400184 if a man does not keep pace with his companions perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer let him step to the music he hears however measured or far away
1400185 why isnt barack obama doing better why after all that has happened does he have only a slim two or three point lead over john mccain according to an average of the recent polls why is he basically tied with his opponent when his party is so far ahead
1400186 his age probably has something to do with it so does his race but the polls and focus groups suggest that people arent dismissive of obama or hostile to him instead theyre wary and uncertain
1400187 and the root of it is probably this obama has been a sojourner
1400188 for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as were all our fathers
1400189 this ability to stand apart accounts for his fantastic powers of observation and his skills as a writer and thinker it means that people on almost all sides of any issue can see parts of themselves reflected in obamas eyes but it does make him hard to place when were judging candidates or friends we dont just judge the individuals but the milieus that produced them we judge them by the connections that exist beyond choice and the ground where they will go home to be laid to rest andrew jackson was a backwoodsman john kennedy had his clan ronald reagan was forever associated with the small town virtues of dixon and jimmy carter with plains
1400190 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
1400191 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
1400192 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1400193 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded centre contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1400194 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from messier 87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1400195 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of messier 87
1400196 in messier 87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1400197 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1400198 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1400199 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters centre messier 87 sits at the centre of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the centre probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
1400200 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time
1400201 the discovery of a potential new antibiotic is an exciting advance it could mean a possible novel treatment for people with chronic wounds that are infected with mrsa or other bugs by developing the pure antibiotic into a formula such as a cream it could reduce the contact patients need to have with live maggots to heal wounds it could also offer a potential treatment such as an injection or pill for internal infections like c difficile
1400202 it has been a huge team effort to get to this level and i am delighted with our progress however there is more to do if we are to realise the maximum benefits from this discovery

1400266 instead of using this knowledge to aid u s military personnel to resist interrogation abuse and torture
1400267 the psychologists involved in interrogations at guantanamo including dr james used the information in assisting supervising authorizing facilitating condoning and participating in interrogations which resulted in serious harm abuse and ill treatment of detainees at guantanamo during the time of dr james assignment there

1400272 f ollowing orders is not a defense or justification for a louisiana licensed psychologist to engage in acts which are in violation of his or her ethical or professional responsibilities

1400274 the parties dispute how many times shaffy was notified and how many times she had the dog out of its carrier
1400275 both the flight purser and captain lacey assert that they had no idea that shaffy was iranian or middle eastern prior to learning about this lawsuit
1400276 the reasonableness of the carriers opinion is to be tested on the information available to the airline at the moment a decision is required
1400277 before any of the problems arose during the flight captain lacey had overheard shaffy addressing the crews purser in a hostile and disrespectful manner as shaffy boarded the aircraft
1400278 once the aircraft was in the air and on the way to las vegas captain lacey received multiple calls from various members of the flight crew regarding shaffys recalcitrance
1400279 shaffy has presented no evidence on the number of calls captain lacey did or did not receive and is in no position to dispute that aspect of his testimony and declaration
1400280 moreover even if the crews complaints were exaggerated the captain had no choice but to rely on the information that the crew provided him

1400341 we have also taken animals from four small holdings in ceredigion denbighshire snowdonia and cheshire after they were repossessed
1400342 theres no question the rise in the number of animals we are dealing with is down to the credit crunch the situation is in crisis
1400343 roughly speaking were taking in about three animals a day and we now have 400 cats and 20 dogs
1400344 we have not seen a rise in abandoned pets specifically linked to the credit crunch

1400359 mai he insultat als extremenys he fet una cr tica pol tica als seus dirigents per utilitzar lanticatalanisme en favor de les seves ambicions pol tiques de totes maneres si les informacions manipulades dalguns mitjans de comunicaci els han molestat els hi demano disculpes
1400360 amb altres pol tiques en urbanisme turisme i dinversions a favor duna major diversificaci productiva la destrucci docupaci haguera sigut menor i fins i tot haguera pogut ser de zero en aquesta poca de crisi econ mica
1400361 les xifres de destrucci docupaci en la comunitat valenciana suposen en aquests moments el 26 de la destrucci total docupaci en el conjunt de lestat en el primer semestre de lany la qual cosa significa que leconomia valenciana est destruint treball a un ritme tres vegades superior al conjunt de comunitats
1400362 i aix va afegir que encara no estem en el pitjor de la crisi
1400363 si el senyor camps vol llavar se les mans que se les llave que falta li fa per ell i la seua pol tica de concentraci productiva en turisme intensiu de sol i platja i de rajola salvatge est portant a leconomia de la nostra comunitat a taxes de destrucci docupaci molt superiors a la resta de comunitats aut nomes
1400364 si li tira la culpa de tot el que succeeix en la nostra comunitat al govern central llavors qu fa el senyor camps presidint un govern auton mic haur em de demanar li al delegat del govern que assumira la presid ncia de la generalitat qu hem de fer amb les compet ncies en mat ria econ mica i pressupost ria que t la generalitat s molt trist que un president duna comunitat aut noma es comporte com un mer gerent duna filial dun banc que vol medrar a costa dels errors daltres
1400365 el pitjor est per vindre al setembre quan moltes empreses decidisquen no obrir despu s del par ntesi vacacional o qu s el que creu el senyor camps que anuncia una baixada de 9 en l ndex del comer al detall o lincrement dun 300 en els procediments concursals i que el nostre pa s siga el seg n amb m s processos concursals a la tardor a les taxes de desocupaci en el sector industrial se sumaran les del sector serveis que aguanta a males penes per lestiu i se sumaran a la desocupaci la construcci quan sacaben les obres que finalitzen en aquest per ode i les vacances de molts treballadors daquest sector de la construcci que encara no consten com a desocupats per estar de vacances
1400366 ens preocupa labs ncia del president de la generalitat durant aquest per ode dinici de la crisi igual que la resta del consell que excepte les aparicions estel lars en fires diverses del senyor cotino i les notes de premsa del senyor blasco i companyia res es diu de les previsions econ miques per a la tardor les coses no estan com perqu tot lequip es vaja de vacances i deixe als segon escalons per a fer se c rrec de la gesti pura i dura quan el que cal fer s treballar perqu la crisi no siga devastadora per als ciutadans sobretot per als m s necessitats
1400367 tots els sectors implicats estan dacord en qu lonada m s gran daquesta crisi est per arribar i que el que estem veient fins al moment s n nom s avan os sense molta import ncia per el senyor camps al marge de tirar li la culpa de tot a altres es nega a veure que la nostra economia no ha aprofitat les poques de creixement econ mic per a preparar la per a eixe xoc limitant se a crear escenaris de cart pedra que cauran quan colpege la major de les onades daquesta crisi i que duren el que dura una volta de formula 1 el senyor camps ha deixat indefensa la nostra economia dilapidant recursos que ben invertits en sectors productius i diversificant la nostra oferta econ mica servirien ara per a fer front amb millors infraestructures a la crisi econ mica
1400368 si shaguera invertit i no regalat milions deuros a no se sap qui com en el cas de m n il lusi terra m tica i altres o no shagueren pagat sobrecostos milionaris com els de l pera de val ncia o shaguera pagat a temps els contractes evitant despeses del 9 anuals per interessos de demora a contractistes ara disposar em dinversions productives de recursos p blics i dunes finances sense factures per pagar i si no shaguera endeutat tan salvatgement la nostra administraci ara disposar em dun marge per a endeutar nos i fer front a les necessitats la ciutadania per amb deutes de 13 300 milions dif cilment podem endeutar nos m s sota pena dhaver de tancar la generalitat per fallida
1400369 com vaig tindre ocasi de demostrar en el ple de les corts l nica mesura que ha adoptat va ser la de reduir les inversions en un 25 per res de reduir despeses sup rflues o reduir els despeses corrents encara que els ingressos per iva que ja li vam dir en la discussi dels pressupostos denguany que estaven clarament sobredimensionats en els pressupostos shan vist redu ts en prop dun 30 fins al moment obligant a reduir fins en un 50 les inversions al llarg de 2008

1400394 its a possibility but to be honest i have serious doubts that this will really happen there are many reasons for that especially on the practical side we all have our own lives our own bands and all kinds of things which we have to take care of this playing at festivals is already a very big step for me we can still have a look at all that once we have done all these festivals i think that after those gigs everybody will probably like to have some time off anyway in the beginning of our career we played so many gigs were not going to plan such a hectic tour schedule like we had in the past that would ruin everything were going to have a look at everything and then well see somebody already proposed a tour of two weeks through the states to us something like that is somehow realistic
1400395 i would be very surprised if that would really happen but never say never im always the last one who needs to be convinced michael and jeff are much more busy with those things than i am im also not very much involved in the planning of all the festivals which are scheduled at this moment i barely know in which countries were all going to play laughs
1400396 you may not forget that ken spent several months in a coma ken almost died its really a miracle that hes still alive when he was still in the hospital all the doctors told us that he would most likely never wake up and that we would never be able to talk to him again ken is obviously much stronger than they expected its correct that he reacts much slower than in the past physically hes also not the same as he used to be but his character is still the same he still has the same kind of humour his long term memory is excellent but his short term memory is not so good anymore since ken woke up from his coma he played drums but he stopped with that recently but hes still very interested in music hes even studying recording techniques these days

1400478 if all this involved only grammar i might let it lie but the commas sad fate is i think a metaphor for something larger how we deal with the frantic nature of modern life the comma is after all a small sign that flashes pause it tells the reader to slow down think a bit and then move on we dont have time for that no pauses allowed in this sense the commas fading popularity is also social commentary

1400486 glamoury occult knowledge magic necromancy is a relatively modern word the first example in the oed files is from a scots poem of 1811 adapted from glamour which the oed suggests may be due to the influence of a related word gramarye the connection between magic and grammar is perhaps not instantly obvious to the modern reader
1400487 the narrowing of grammar to mean the rules of language was a much later development meanwhile grammar had percolated into scottish english where an l was substituted for an r and the word eventually became glamour used to mean knowledge of magic and spells

1400507 the establishment of a national youth league competition is an important component of the national football development plan
1400508 this is a competition which will provide an important link between elite youth football the hyundai a league competition and the national representative teams not only for players but also coaches and referees
1400509 for the first time talented young players will have an opportunity to play regular quality competitive games regardless of whether they are part of the ais program the state sports institutes or the state football leagues
1400510 football offers young talented male athletes fantastic opportunities within australia as well as unparalleled opportunities to represent australia on the biggest stage in world sport
1400511 i will be showing ivan around the training ground and portman road
1400512 he has played at the highest level for many years and is someone i feel could do a good job for us
1400513 hes got bags of experience and could come into the club and really help our younger players but we havent got that far down the line yet
1400514 we will sit down and have a chat and if there is something that we can sort out then great if not we move on
1400515 the young players were fantastic and young rafael the right back was a sensation for me
1400516 i thought it was a real eye opener for us he hadnt played for a year but hes played a full 90 minutes today his brother fabio has played 45 minutes and hes also done well so were really pleased by their contribution
1400517 you know what footballs like sometimes it turns up some star some little nugget maybe on the evidence of tonight i think we have got a good player here
1400518 i have grown up 10 minutes from the ground i know what it means to the people of birmingham
1400519 its very much a passionate club the fans are about the blues
1400520 i think a many of them arent happy that a club of this size is in the championship it belongs in the premier league
1400521 it belongs in the top half of the premier league
1400522 one of the things me and the manager spoke about when we sat down to sign was that i want to win the championship i want to win some medals i want to get promoted and stabilise the club in the premier league thats what i am thinking about
1400523 this was my test regarding the sacred aspect of moustaches

1400527 he would be a welcome addition not just because of his ability but because of the position that he plays and our obvious need to upgrade our defense
1400528 at the end of the season well see whats appropriate for the galaxy and landon
1400529 i dont look for us to be making any changes with those players for the rest of the season unless something incredible is offered to us
1400530 it doesnt need to be blown up it doesnt need major reconstruction does it need an attitude readjustment absolutely the sky is not falling no matter what people write or say we are going to need more men and less boys
1400531 we need to get to a point with the galaxy where we are able to score one goal and win the game were not there yet if we hope to make the playoffs and take another run at an mls cup we need to get there
1400532 we have set about from the start recognizing our ability to attack is an incredible weapon and also recognizing it will lead to times it can hurt us were still trying to find the proper balance
1400533 ultimately i think the players that we have here now stars and non stars alike have to take ownership and take responsibility
1400534 i have confidence in my abilities and i have confidence in who i am i dont feel its appropriate for a gm to run around and try and qualify everything and quantify everything
1400535 i know people are frustrated i know people are angry they expect and deserve better than what we are giving them especially in recent performances everyone from myself on down in this organization are doing everything possible to have this team succeed

1400545 i was a little bit tired on saturday because ive only had one weeks training but i will be more or less fit for the start of the premier league season
1400546 i hopefully want to win that trophy or maybe the champions league
1400547 we showed that ade and i have a few nice combinations together
1400548 that is really important for two strikers you always have to work together you always have to look for each other hopefully this is a good start
1400549 hopefully there will be two or three players coming on board before the transfer window closes
1400550 at the end of last season i thought we needed another top striker at the club and ive not changed that view because youve got to put the ball in the back of the net
1400551 hes got incredible skill has magic in his feet and is capable of anything on a football pitch his quality is amazing it would be great if he joined us and hed be made very welcome here
1400552 two defeats is not the way i envisaged coming back with england i didnt wait 18 months to get beaten
1400553 it wasnt ideal but in a perverse way the first one at headingley i enjoyed in the sense of being back around the lads playing in front of a big crowd and playing for england
1400554 i just wish the outcome had been slightly different because for six months ive had to work so hard to get back in the side i am enjoying being there
1400555 ive had a start ive bowled some overs and ive batted okay but now i need to start performing properly
1400556 before this ankle operation i thought if i didnt think i could recapture the form of previously i wouldnt have put myself up for all of this
1400557 i feel i can do that i feel i am getting there but i can rattle on as much as i can about it ive got to start doing it out on the field
1400558 people go on about the ashes next year weve got thursday to concentrate on weve got beaten twice by south africa and weve got to pull it around a bit
1400559 it is not a dead rubber maybe it is in the context of the series but we are playing for england and we are certainly playing for pride it is not measured by a trophy or a cheque there is a lot for us to play for as cricketers
1400560 for a start weve got to score more runs in the first innings of a test match than we have in the last two to give ourselves a decent chance
1400561 its been frustrating watching him over the last four or five years seeing how good he is but not doing as well as he should be doing i think since last year hes got his focus right hes sorted his mind out and hes not as cocky as he was he deserves the rewards hes getting
1400562 i was with him on sunday we had a game and he was delighted to be back in the test squad if he gets another go he will deliver the goods
1400563 he has the game for test level definitely its a case of mindset he has to take his cricket up to the next level hes got big runs in county cricket but test cricket is a step up for him if he can sort his approach out there is no reason why he cant reproduce his form
1400564 i wouldnt say he didnt take things seriously but everything was light hearted easy come easy go once he had a taste of international cricket he realised you need to knuckle down and be relentless at training you need to be more professional and have a better approach to games
1400565 to his credit hes done that very well in the last couple of years and his performances have been eye catching to the selectors
1400566 it was never a monkey on my back that i was desperate to get rid of although it is good to cross that line
1400567 it has been a tough few weeks for me i havent scored runs or had a long innings in any competition
1400568 i dont mind that it took me a few games to reach it having to wait means that i have savoured the achievement i didnt want it to be easy hundreds are difficult to get they dont grow on trees
1400569 we were focused on the situation and just playing the game
1400570 i never look too far ahead we knew we had to battle it out that pre lunch session was important
1400571 i was out with my parents a couple of days ago and i said wouldnt it be funny if my 100th was here i feel comfortable at headingley my test debut was also made here
1400572 when i got to 49 darren gough mentioned it to me so he obviously knew too
1400573 i was just so pleased to get a first class hundred
1400574 mike gatting middlesex captain made a big deal of celebrating it with me we had a drink in the bar and all went out for fish and chips i have fond memories of headingley
1400575 the pitch at that time was an old style headingley wicket plenty of variable bounce this one wasnt quite so bad as that
1400576 both attacks i faced were very disciplined and hit the bat hard paul jarvis and peter hartley played in that game and the three seamers here in gough tim bresnan and deon kruis bowled well and intelligently
1400577 the pitch was excellent but i came up against glenn mcgrath jason gillespie brett lee and shane warne i really had to work hard for that one
1400578 it was difficult to get into any sort of rhythm i wasnt spending long enough at the crease
1400579 i broke the bat i had been using for the last two years in that innings at hove and have struggled since
1400580 i borrowed a bat off scott newman today the first time i had hit a ball with it was yesterday i think he might let me keep that one now
1400581 you do get thoughts going through your mind but the way things had been going i wasnt going to take anything for granted
1400582 i dared not dwell on it too much you only need to get one good ball and you are out i had to concentrate very hard
1400583 when you go through lows you come out a different person
1400584 you become a more positive person i wouldnt say careless person but a more fearless person because youve been there
1400585 its just like if you let a dog roam on the streets eventually they become fearless you know
1400586 they are out on the streets they know the streets they become fearless because they have been through so many downs
1400587 that is how i feel right now i am not saying i have been through a lot of low stuff but i feel as if this time i have no fear
1400588 hes the new captain and hes already rubbed off on me you learn off guys like that and i have been lucky to have had very positive people around me
1400589 i have been around in this england changing room with the likes of kp next to me hes a good mate of mine and we talk a lot
1400590 i am going to go out and play for kev he has a tough job on his hands we all know the england captaincy is not an easy job i want to do well for kev and do well for england that is all i am thinking about
1400591 this summer has been very good for me in all forms of cricket it has all been pretty prolific compared to the rest of my years
1400592 the challenge for me is to continue it with an england shirt on the thing that all good test players do is take what they do for their counties and replicate it on the international stage
1400593 that is what i am going to do if i get a chance to play test cricket again for england
1400594 i am going to go out and do what i do for essex nothing different its the same ball game just different players
1400595 for me it is a fantastic opportunity we know the series is over but we still have pride to play for
1400596 and if i play it will give me the chance to put something on the board and go into the winter with something positive under my belt
1400597 i dont have many regrets about sri lanka to be fair it happened all so quickly
1400598 at that time the sri lankans were too good for me it just didnt go the way i imagined it to go and it was because of good pieces of bowling sometimes and other times my own error
1400599 there were just a couple of things i had to work on because if it comes up in the future i dont want to be found out in that situation
1400600 i went away and worked on them but it is important to move on quickly
1400601 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1400602 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1400603 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1400604 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1400605 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1400606 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1400607 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1400608 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1400609 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1400610 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1400611 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1400612 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1400613 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1400614 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings

1400619 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1400620 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1400621 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1400622 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue

1400648 it is a magnificent development and shows the improvements we have made in island cricket in recent years
1400649 its ironic that though the isle of wight was granted minor county status only last year we are believed to be the first one in the country with our own county ground

1400682 well start on thursday but weve got a lot of cricket coming up to christmas so its an exciting time
1400683 one of the first things i wanted to do when we were going to offer him the captaincy was to sit down with him and talk to him about where he was coming from and what were his views about where he wanted the side to go and whether they matched with mine
1400684 we sat down and talked for a good hour or so and by the end of it we both felt very confident that we were coming from the same place which was exciting so i drove away quite buoyant and excited about what the future might hold
1400685 what i like about kevin is hes got a view

1400691 farmers and ranchers like all consumers across america are feeling the tremendous financial impact of historically high energy costs
1400692 in addition to gasoline costs diesel prices have risen drastically for agricultural producers while fertilizer costs which are closely tied to natural gas prices have doubled in the last two years now more than ever the agricultural sector is looking to congress for leadership to help alleviate these costs on consumers
1400693 the development of energy resources anywhere in the united states
1400694 clearly legitimate policy issues need to be addressed in crafting an energy plan that encompasses such an approach and it will need the cooperative constructive efforts of members from both political parties
1400695 we urge the leadership of both parties in both houses of congress to put aside short term political considerations and work together to craft a long range bipartisan effective energy plan that will finally put our nation on a path toward affordable energy independence
1400696 the stressed cotton is at the cutout stage in many areas and yield potential will be further limited if rainfall is not received soon
1400697 cutout is officially determined when the top of the plant is within four to five nodes of the uppermost first position white bloom but it can also be easily determined when we start observing blooms in the top of the plant
1400698 producers refer to this as blooming in the top in healthy plants the nodes above white flower should be seven or eight at first bloom and decrease by approximately one node per week during blooming we have not only been observing this in dryland cotton but also in irrigated cotton when water is short or root growth has been inhibited
1400699 in some fields we are observing what an extension specialist in louisiana refers to as suspended cutout the nodes above white flower stay the same and the plant continues to fruit for several weeks
1400700 if the fields are getting plenty of water the next thing to look for is nitrogen or other nutrient deficiency caused by a restricted root system in these situations a foliar nitrogen application could extend fruiting allowing the plant to hold one or two more bolls
1400701 a rainfall soon will cause some small bolls to drop but new growth will initiate and new squares and blooms will develop in the top of the plant these new squares need to be on the plant by mid august to produce a harvestable boll
1400702 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
1400703 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1400704 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
1400705 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1400706 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
1400707 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
1400708 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
1400709 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
1400710 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
1400711 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
1400712 when we launched galaxy zoo we were overwhelmed as was the internet portal initially with the outpouring of public interest and volunteer input
1400713 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1400714 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
1400715 some simulations and even experiments have shown that water retains its liquid state and bulk viscosity even under extreme confinement down to 0 1 nm
1400716 at the same time some other experiments have shown that the viscosity of water changes under confinement this experimental controversy is the difficulty existing in literature to explain how water would behave as a lubricant under various situations
1400717 our experiment undoubtedly demonstrates that water crystallizes at room temperature under confinement
1400718 this is a strong step towards resolving the existing controversy of whether or not water would change its bulk property due to confinement
1400719 the ice that forms in the confinement is normal ice most probably ice with a hexagonal lattice which is the form of the most common crystalline ice seen in nature
1400720 it is difficult to foresee an application at this level of invention
1400721 the foreseeable difficulty is that in mems and nems where the contact areas are shrinking in dimensions ice formation could be a big problem that causes immediate failure of the devices on the other hand to increase friction wherever necessary this technique could be employed but it is so far a fiction i would say

1400747 thats kind of a tricky question ive got colleagues in the senate who are doing absolutely outstanding work and theyre well into their 70s
1400748 call off all protests during the convention if the city federal government and the dnc agree to redirect the current 50 million earmarked for heightened security during the dnc and invest it in denver communities

1400755 were worse off than we were four years ago only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again
1400756 senator mccain wants americans to forget that during the republican primary he said that americans were better off than we were eight years ago and that he thinks weve made great progress economically he wants us to forget that hes fully embraced the bush policies he once opposed and bragged about supporting those policies more than 90 percent of time the truth is being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades it isnt having a campaign run by washington lobbyists and its certainly not promoting the same policies that have led america down the wrong path these past eight years
1400757 not only is the celtic trail a wonderfully healthy and environmentally friendly way to see and appreciate some of the best countryside in wales its also becoming a valuable economic asset

1400768 bills writing is sublime buckets full of good sense so well written you help us to keep on top of issues we would be unaware of otherwise
1400769 i particularly like bill bonners style and values it makes a refreshing change to read something so in tune with my own thinking i look forward to seeing your e letter in my mail box every day
1400770 i have complete faith in what captain anil kumble can do
1400771 there is a calm focus about the team and there is a humility about how we are going to go about our business there is no arrogance in the environment
1400772 these players are aware what they need to do and they are right on track in terms of preparations the important thing is the awareness of the situation they know they have an opportunity to win the series
1400773 every guy is aware if he is not fully focused for the next test it could affect the teams performance
1400774 we were happy with the teams response as they lifted their performance by at least 20 percent in galle
1400775 but the important thing is there is a real awareness about things to achieve in the next test and we have always believed that when this team is firing on all cylinders they can match the best in the world
1400776 there was a tremendous hurt in the team after the loss i think it all started with kumble and from there it filtered down to the rest of the team he is a fantastic leader and fighter
1400777 so to motivate the team to improve their performance by 20 percent was not really difficult the big challenge now is to see that they maintain it in the third test since they have pulled one back
1400778 he is quality seamer and at the moment he stands out in the indian line up i am very impressed by what he has to offer
1400779 he is learning which are good areas to bowl so at the end of the day we tell him to bowl the natural length and when he is bowling his natural length he is as good as anyone in the world

1400866 it was scary the back hatch of the van was open and my daughter was still under it and it came down on the back of the vehicle we thought it was a fairly sheltered site

1400876 we need to be asking ourselves some pretty tough questions about why almost 1000 kids are being chucked out of primary schools for behaviour that is just so bad that schools have got to the point where they wont even work with it
1400877 but its when you look deeper into those statistics and you start to tease them out that you get a different kind of view of the world
1400878 and that view of the world fits with what we are experiencing in schools which is much more difficult scenarios all of the time
1400879 if you want to stop this behaviour you have to stop it as young as you possibly can
1400880 what it says is that we are seeing an increasing number of younger and younger students with behaviour and mental health issues

1400909 we have been asking for ten years for our community to be able to go to morphou through limnitis while at the same time the un and the turkish cypriots use this road every day without any problem by this logic there is no reason why we cant go to morphou
1400910 i have no quibble with the turkish cypriots and i have good co operation with the turkish cypriot village leaders but if we are not allowed to go this time i am sorry we will not allow them to pass the turkish cypriots are allowed to come to celebrate their victory against us and all we ask is to go to morphou to pray for the missing and dead who are buried there
1400911 the man is trying as best he can but unless we get a formal reply that we can go on august 8 and september 2 to pray we will not allow the turkish cypriot buses to pass through our area
1400912 we have tolerated the turkish cypriots crossing despite their reasons because we wanted to be good but with the developments despite the good will shown by our side the occupation army have not moved from their position
1400913 and according to what we are hearing now nothing different can be expected this time either
1400914 it is not wise at this time nor will it help efforts to open a crossing
1400915 there is a strong likelihood that such demonstrations could lead ultimately to greater delays

1400962 people just think about muslims who do bad things i think people should learn more about islam before they judge others
1400963 those youngsters will be our leaders in the future and we need to instil a balanced knowledge of islam in their minds if they are given the right information in the beginning it will be good for everybody

1400973 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time this is more than about an open competition and i can do that absolutely but this is going to be mass confusion and thats not good for this team
1400974 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work and i truly understand that if i was in mikes shoes id see it basically the same way he sees it im sure and i think if he was in my shoes hed see it my way i think we both agree on that
1400975 we found out doing our usability studies that people didnt think you should drag things into a black hole
1400976 some say the decision can be perceived as the allusive recognition of the trnc by fifa and the union of european football associations uefa
1400977 with a view to improving relations between the football communities on the island of cyprus
1400978 this is an interim measure prior to a solution to the cyprus problem
1400979 to play in formal competitions you have to be a member of fifa the only way would be to join the greek cypriot league but we are not willing to do this therefore we would only be able to play friendly matches under this proposal
1400980 with a view to improving relations between the football communities on the island
1400981 the offer would allow turkish cypriot clubs to play friendlies against clubs from other countries but we are not talking about the setting up of a new national side
1400982 there are also two conditions attached firstly any clubs wanting to take up the offer would have to be affiliated to the official cypriot fa
1400983 secondly in accordance with our statutes the official fa would have to give its approval for these matches to go ahead
1400984 in order for any matches to be staged in the north the ctfa must sign a document whereby they recognise the cfa and agree to become members this must be done by september
1400985 not accommodated any request for a friendly match without our prior approval

1401027 they said wed accessed the membership benefits by eating at red lobster
1401028 failing to give consumers clear and conspicuous notice of their right to cancel and in fact advising consumers that they could not cancel
1401029 its outrageous that this club found some loophole to get around the law and nobody can do anything about it

1401035 it wasnt even close in value to what i had

1401043 i have an extensive music collection on original cd media while most of it is in impeccable condition i have a few discs that have suffered extensive scratching through listening to the disc either via a portable disc player or in a car cd stacker ive long since learned the error of my old ways and dont listen to discs in those devices any more but those discs are irreplaceable in many cases i would very much like to be able to repair them or have them repaired to original condition or at least well enough that i can pull the tracks off once and archive the track data i have heard really uncomplimentary things about devices like the ranging from it not helping to it making things worse ive heard great things about clean the disk well and rip it with cdparanoia try ripping it with both cdparanoia and with yes the abrasive in toothpaste can help to polish out the scratches but really especially as these are valuable irreplaceable discs you should just get it done professionally get toothpaste not gel but regular white paste get a small cloth put a dab on it then rub it from the center to the outside in straight lines going outwards around the whole disk when youre done clean it off and pat it dry disk will look like hell but itll work polishing anything requires a lot of skill to get it right its just as easy to screw up your cd than to make it better learn how to carefully polish things before you start and practice on things you dont need toothpaste will not remove scratches that you can feel but it may clean out the grooves of the scratch enough for them to be read 1 take a power drill make sure the hammer action is off 2 place the cd on the chuck tighten the chuck around a bolt and washer to keep it in place 3 clamp the drill in a bench vice 4 spin the cd at 30 000rpm toothpaste eh working porn dvd and clean teeth all in one swoop the way this works by the way is that white toothpaste contains fullers earth wikipedia org which is a very mild abrasive this polishes the disk back to readability use this as your last resort only when eac and cdparanoia have both failed note also if you hold the disk up to the light and see i wonder if that works on 3 5

1401056 these deaths should not be considered an inevitable part of the teen experience
1401057 adults dont act on all those impulses we sort them but teens have a hard time doing this
1401058 you have a responsibility to make sure your child isnt going to drive into someone else head on because hes busy chatting on his cell phone and nobodys told him hang up the phone and drive the car
1401059 you dont suddenly become a good driver when you turn 16
1401060 we need to ease teens into a lifelong habit of good driving
1401061 its clear that giving young drivers more time behind the wheel with supervision makes a big difference
1401062 statistically we know that somebodys going to leave home and is not going to survive because this bill didnt become law

1401079 by introducing self extinguishing cigarettes at least 2 000 lives could be saved in the eu each year
1401080 if the self extinguishing cigarette can contribute to reducing this number its introduction has to be seen positively
1401081 what is very important is that consumers should understand that those changes do not make fire safe or even fire safer cigarettes
1401082 anything that burns if handled carelessly can cause a fire
1401083 the elimination of burning agents in cigarette paper would be a simple and effective means of dramatically reducing the ignition propensity of cigarettes

1401094 employers should be careful that they are going to get sued they are treating employees unfairly in the first place and wasting human resources in the context that they are relying on these weight based stereotypes
1401095 this is what weve hoped for for years to come out
1401096 hes looked at the stereotypes and proven that they are not true
1401097 you cant simply flush peoples lives down the toilet because you are worried theyre going to get sick
1401098 there are very few shock absorbers left for u s consumers
1401099 they are facing a credit crunch a sharp slowdown in the economy that has triggered higher unemployment and price shocks in energy and in food on top of that they can no longer use their houses as atms
1401100 but today if the u s contracts the rest of the world might contract by only half thats a fundamental change
1401101 but as wages in those countries rise theyll cease to be a helpful force for disinflation and start to drive inflation higher
1401102 there will be entry points to buy real assets at lower prices in the future
1401103 commodity prices for example are volatile and likely to get more so arriving at that 20 percent should be a long term rather than a short term goal

1401113 i hated god for allowing this to happen to my family
1401114 i lost my religion the minute i saw my mother lying there
1401115 after being horizontal for months im so happy i can stand hug give rides again
1401116 right before i went into surgery ty asked can we play airplanes again when youre all better when we do its one of the best times of my life
1401117 i was in my 40s with a young son and my wife and i were building a life around him thats when something from my past threatened to take it all away

1401124 it caused me a little bit of a problem but people should get over it
1401125 if i called it daves cafe no one would talk about it
1401126 youre waiting around and in that time you couldve gotten something done like walk the dog
1401127 obviously for my job and doctors appointments i go out of my way to be on time
1401128 that way his being late equals him being on time
1401129 and heres the simple fact i got here on time and you can manage to as well
1401130 if its a friend who does this a lot and it really puts you out remind them that your time is just as valuable as theirs
1401131 in new york they wait until the agreed meeting time and then they go were more laid back and tolerate more than we probably should
1401132 if were talking about someone who is chronically late they might be avoiding anxiety or anger or resisting something
1401133 perhaps they are overscheduled and need to say no once in a while
1401134 he always taught me its better to be safe than sorry
1401135 if im late for practice it just stresses me out
1401136 they made it very clear a year ago that they werent going to do the things that normal businesses do and that this was a privately held company and the press was going to have to go away because they arent going to disclose whats going on in the company
1401137 this is a break in that whats surprising is that this sets a tone and precedent once they do that theyre going to have to do it again
1401138 in a time like this when some of the other industry players may be encountering some difficulties and there is a lot of interest in the creditworthiness of companies a lot of speculation false speculation is rumbling around about our company
1401139 chryslers limited financial resources represent a distinct competitive disadvantage over the near term as the industry experiences a period of rapid product migration and technological change
1401140 i think it is probably just to try to make the company look a little bit better
1401141 theyve been getting a lot of criticism in many circles about just how are they actually doing we keep hearing jim press stating were ahead of plan were ahead of plan everything looks great but their sales are down by a quarter for the year and 30 percent over the last two months those two statements dont mash up
1401142 although the passenger demand grew by 3 8 percent this is the slowest growth that we have seen since the industry was hit by the sars crisis in 2003
1401143 with consumer and business confidence falling and sky high oil prices the situation will get a lot worse
1401144 losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry

1401183 the most common mode of analysis in economic theory is to assume equilibrium yet without a proper theory of how economies behave in disequilibrium there is no foundation for such a practice the necessary step in proposing a foundation is the formulation of a theory of stability and professor fisher is primarily concerned with this subject although disequilibrium behavior itself is analyzed the author first undertakes a review of the existing literature on the stability of general equilibrium he then proposes a more satisfactory general model in which agents realize their state of disequilibrium and act on arbitrage opportunities the interrelated topics of the role of money the nature of quantity constraints and the optimal behaviour of arbitraging agents are extensively treated
1401184 in economics most noncooperative game theory has focused on equilibrium in games especially nash equilibrium and its refinements the traditional explanation for when and why equilibrium arises is that it results from analysis and introspection by the players in a situation where the rules of the game the rationality of the players and the players payoff functions are all common knowledge both conceptually and empirically this theory has many problems in the theory of learning in games drew fudenberg and david levine develop an alternative explanation that equilibrium arises as the long run outcome of a process in which less than fully rational players grope for optimality over time the models they explore provide a foundation for equilibrium theory and suggest useful ways for economists to evaluate and modify traditional equilibrium concepts

1401211 the ecb and the fed have moved to a more similar framework here with the fed having to do more of the motion
1401212 im not convinced it would have been appropriate for the fed to accept whatever came its way as collateral during the worst of times

1401253 if i will have the opportunity to train and play without injuries i would like to leave my mark on the history of chelsea injuries constantly kept me out of action
1401254 i have trained with the team only a week the process of recovery is taking place normally and the injury doesnt bother me
1401255 it is gratifying that the coach gave me an opportunity to get back to the rhythm of playing
1401256 we had a good conversation im only now getting into shape and recovering from injury so prefence is given to those players who are in better form
1401257 the coach always chooses the best players in order to choose the best scheme i very much respect scolari as a man and a great coach
1401258 i think the challenge for the coach now is to find the optimum team and help the players achieve their best form

1401277 they are the product of the same lineage and this cannot be good for any country and any community can you just imagine the maladjustments of this generation of young people
1401278 this is well known we know this already i work in an inner city community and this is something i know very well
1401279 the police face a dilemma oftentimes we do not have a case there are no complainants to a crime there are those who will say the police have a responsibility to act yes we do but when you have unwilling relatives parents included who will deny it what do you do

1401287 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1401288 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1401289 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time

1401338 some things weve taken a lot and there are also a ton of areas in apb that are completely new and unique to apb itself so theres a mix of things that came from crackdown but as much as anything its just what the company was set up to do what daves always wanted to do from gta and before crackdown and apb
1401339 i dont know i cant tell you for sure whether or not well have them or not
1401340 we still like to mess with that stuff sometimes in late stages just in terms of yeah its taking a little too long to get this one which is why we didnt want anybody to look at them because i wouldnt want you guys putting something out that we then changed and is completely different
1401341 yeah theyre largely in there and theres some really good ones in there some that i rather enjoy
1401342 im not feeling any pressure at the moment because time is not critical yet

1401345 youre probably actually more bound maybe by art authoring and the amount of data throughput that just the amount of memory youd need but i dont think 360 has reached its limit

1401372 these things arent enjoyable when people are too drunk and all about partying we waste stage time trying to get them to settle down we dont want anything dangerous we just want to dance and jam and have a good time

1401533 theres just a sense about him that when he talks hes telling you something you cant live without
1401534 he has us believing we can do anything and that feeling is spreading like wildfire throughout the team what does he bring he brings confidence
1401535 and now were inexperienced at safety its not good to be starting over in an area where you were weak thats wills task to make us complicated enough back there to give offenses problems and make it simple enough for our young guys to handle
1401536 greg davis has promised me hes going to score some points
1401537 i tell the guys if were not coaching you hard were not coaching you
1401538 so were going to coach the guys texas football is important to and putting those horns on every saturday is important to those are the guys who are committed to doing it and were going to coach those guys hard
1401539 your actions speak so loud i cant hear what youre saying
1401540 i understand it now and i tell it to our players here at texas
1401541 you talk about being a great player you talk about being committed you talk about being a great teammate a great student or a great son your actions speak so loudly i cant hear what youre telling me because your actions arent exactly what youre telling me you want to be your actions are what make your character thats something that i live by daily am i exhibiting the right actions for the kids doing the right things for the kids or making the right decisions are we coaching something and not acting something out i think thats a saying i always remember my dad saying
1401542 nothing fazes the guy he gets more hyped than the players but he knows exactly what hes doing a lot of coaches jump around and get distracted or fail to connect with their players will jumps around because what hes telling you is working
1401543 nick saban even yelled at will not to hurt me
1401544 im a defensive guy thats my baby so ive followed him and watched his teams and will is an excellent coach

1401546 my dream was to play major college football growing up
1401547 i didnt really care where i just wanted to play on saturday and all of a sudden it was sort of taken from me
1401548 but it goes back to what my dad always told me 10 percent of life is what happens to you and 90 percent is what you do with it so we can think life is not fair or you can roll your sleeves up and go to work thats what i decided to do
1401549 wills first day in pads in tackling drills we knew he was going to be a physical guy
1401550 he would put his face on you hes still as intense as he was his freshman year its a direct correlation we have this quote in house that says players are a reflection of their coach not to knock anyone else everyone has done a great job here but because i had the pleasure of playing with will these players are a reflection of him and the way he played
1401551 when the opportunity to come to texas presented itself i leaned heavily on mcwhorter davis and wynn and their idea of coach brown and the university and the kind of job it is
1401552 i looked at the blue collar attitude of that construction crew and how they worked a lot of hours
1401553 they bring the lunch pail to work every day and thats the mentality i want us to take
1401554 its a huge source of pride the way coach muschamp hands it out
1401555 its not in your group meeting room tucked away its on the wall for the whole team to see if youre not producing everyone sees it

1401593 were trying to get these kids prepared for the 21st century and this is one way we can by introducing them to a new language

1401600 throughout north america clusters of churches are reclaiming the churchs role as the primary equipping entity and sending agency of gods people on mission

1401657 dr carsten smidt and dr jamie mcmanus got rave reviews after their presentations
1401658 this will be the most exhilarating product launch weve had since roger barnett bought the company
1401659 our company not to mention our industry has never seen anything like this it will create an industry wide buzz

1401661 theres no more excuses there is too much talent here too much talent with experience were hungry this is our year to blow up

1401664 two years ago when quarterback tyler palko was a senior i dont think anyone considered our play calling conservative
1401665 i said this in my opening press conference you throw the ball to score points you run the ball to win
1401666 its weird if i head out to the mall or something people are coming up to me and asking me about pitt
1401667 everywhere we go its been like that people want to know about pitt pitt pitt thats all we hear about and its a good thing now we have to deliver

1401670 when i have a conversation with someone whos excited for this upcoming season my first reaction is we gotta prove it
1401671 until apple removes the legal roadblocks we will not be able to provide a product that can be installed through the app store onto a standard
1401672 not recommending requesting or encouraging you to make any unauthorized modifications to your device
1401673 there are warranty upgrade and usability issues with jailbroken devices that you need to understand before you choose that approach
1401674 this sounds like a policy straight out of a saturday night live skit not a serious proposal
1401675 the idea that millions of people are going to knock on the governments door and asked to be deported is pure fantasy this is not a solution this is mass deportation on the cheap and it just wont work
1401676 if our government is serious about fixing our countrys broken immigration system it must move beyond its single minded focus on creating new deportation policies
1401677 by creating new programs like operation scheduled departure ice does nothing more than separate families harm communities erode due process and in the worst cases subject men women and children to danger in their native countries it is time that congress steps up and takes reponsibility by passing laws that restore fairness and humanity to our immigration system
1401678 why in the hell did he pack a laptop in his checked luggage

1401680 the first phone call i placed was answered cordially i was told that someone would get back to me i never heard back from anyone
1401681 the second time i called the person i was speaking with hung up and the third time i called the line was disconnected
1401682 it is clear to me that the mccain campaign is not interested in speaking to the issues
1401683 we believe that they owe it not only to us to respond to the questionnaire but to their base
1401684 when building a team i first search for people who love to win if i cant find any of those i then look for people who hate to lose
1401685 isnt it a little late for you guys to be out
1401686 you expletive you tell your expletive mexican friends get the expletive out of shenandoah or youre going to be laying expletive next to them
1401687 tell your mexican friends to get out of shenandoah or they will be lying next to him
1401688 in the past few weeks ive been invited to several legal sessions with different law firms and in house counsel discussing the potential of web 2 0 technologies many of the concerns addressed are similar ip privacy copyright trade secrets etc for the most part many of these issues are easily addressed many organizations already have policies in place to address many of these issues such as simple terms of service disclaimers and employee blogging social computing guidelines
1401689 whenever users are given the freedom to create what ever they want it is clear that they will do just that this is always a risk when initiating an open source project luckily an open source community is just that a community community members monitor the content and keep the environment enjoyable for all this is why wikipedia and youtube have been so successful administrators are necessary to have the final say in what content stays and what goes but it is largely a community affair
1401690 on the other hand wikipedia struggles with the issue of censorship and bias you just cant trust wikipedia because its edited by a bunch of conservatives liberals they arent telling the whole story of course that argument can be made with the mainstream media as well but when a major network or newspaper is biased or commits censorship people complain and or go somewhere else for their news they dont solve the problem in this case wikipedians thoughtfully discussed the issue reached a compromise voted democratically and solved or at least moved towards a solution for the problem
1401691 if each person is their own brand then your online identity is a large integral part of that brand but how do you manage all of the content yours or otherwise that becomes attached to your name
1401692 seeing this led me to ponder a simple question what about everyone else
1401693 i havent heard anything about an upcoming wedding from lindsay but if she was marrying sam i dont think shed ask me to walk her down the aisle
1401694 she knows about my christian faith she just wouldnt ask
1401695 i want her to be happy and healthy and stay on the right path if i discuss her relationship i say that i want her to be happy
1401696 this community gay for me is my beloved community this true colors tour is not a money making venture i have been running with this community all my life and when i hear people like george bush talk about the gay community being anti american it makes my blood boil
1401697 the guy who saved the white house one of the heroes who crashed that plane on 9 11 was gay the rugby player mark bingham who died on united 93 and does bush ever mention that does he f k
1401698 that gay guy saved his lousy ass and this guy who says he prays to god this guy who promotes hate and fear this guy we call our president this guy is the true anti american
1401699 we created a whole new business just to build custom products for those customers
1401700 blogs are a good way to make things happen indirectly
1401701 i wish i was still single going home to read a magazine instead of cooking dinner for some asshole

1401707 i thought hed be kind of supportive about it rub my back or hold my hair out of my face there was none of that at all he seemed totally disappointed in me
1401708 i dont like the fact that people think latinos wont vote for an african american its bulls t were going to vote for the right person who can restore faith and hope in this country latinos feel disenfranchised obamas dream is our dream
1401709 no other rapper or entertainer is as committed to the community as master p and i am proud of him
1401710 master p changed his life and took the negativity out of his music but stayed true to the hood
1401711 but i dont admire the attention he gets although i think he brings some of that s t upon himself
1401712 the defendant s internationally released and distributed the everywhere album containing their infringing copies of a song substantially similar to plaintiffs song anytime anywhere amanda
1401713 its great i want it back i want the records back
1401714 i need the jewels hes just got laying around he dont gotta tell me what to do with it all he has to do is say track six or go to track eight hell have hits playing there you just have to get in and get them

1401720 how are you today mr doyle you want the usual
1401721 tax reform is desperately needed in the united states but before we can reform the tax code we must sharply reduce the tax burden on americans made necessary
1401722 the american people simply cannot afford more of the same which means more government spending more special interest pay offs more fraud and waste and continuing to treat american taxpayers like geese to be plucked rather than citizens of a free society and democratic republic
1401723 the individuals right to keep and bear arms helps ensure all of our freedoms the supreme courts recognition of the constitutional right to gun ownership is a recognition of the right to life liberty and property for all americans
1401724 we must address the issue of climate change but do so realistically recognizing the importance of simultaneously expanding energy supplies and maintaining economic growth our greatest strength in confronting the problems of the future is our free market economy only by reducing government barriers to private research and development are we going to achieve the innovative even transformational changes necessary in the years and decades ahead
1401725 america should not be the worlds policeman the american purpose is to provide a strong national defense not to engage in nation building or to launch foreign crusades no matter how seemingly well intentioned
1401726 neither the republicans nor the democrats can be trusted to protect the privacy and civil liberties of the american people as president i would never forget that it is a free society which we must defend we must never sacrifice the individual freedoms that make america so unique

1401732 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
1401733 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
1401734 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
1401735 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines
1401736 for example the chinese government has already created profiles of thousands of foreign journalists coming to cover the olympic games
1401737 to punish anyone who takes part in a political religious or ethnic demonstration or protest in any form at an olympic site during the 2008 beijing games
1401738 instead of lecturing china where i have no doubt there are problems as there are everywhere i would suggest that we turn our attention to the very real threats in a united states where our civil liberties and human rights are being eroded on a steady basis

1401754 falei da import ncia de n o se iludir com as olimp adas e se concentrar para lutar agora esse frenezi todo da imprensa dos amigos da fam lia da torcida mas se deixarmos nossa chance de um bom resultado passar tudo acaba para continuar com esse clima preciso vencer

1401759 o brasil tamb m favorito e eles ainda t m o ronaldinho que est muito motivado e com certeza ser o diferencial
1401760 mas a argentina sempre tem a obriga o de ganhar e faremos de tudo para defender o ouro
1401761 n o sou muito importante e nem demasiadamente diferente do resto do grupo temos sim uma camisa muito forte mas sabemos da necessidade de trabalhar muito para arrancarmos com o p direito
1401762 se ganharmos a primeira partida vamos ter grande parte da classifica o assegurada sabemos que temos uma equipe boa mas contra n s todos dar o um pouco mais de si
1401763 o reinaldo veio por indica o do negreiros que um diretor que eu conhe o ele um menino que est fazendo um per odo de avalia o mas n o tem nada a ver com o momento e o reinaldo n o chegou para tirar a confian a de um ou de outro o goleiro titular o douglas

1401765 vamos jogar contra o brasil e isso muito legal uma oportunidade fant stica para os nossos jogadores eles v o poder jogar contra o ronaldinho que o grande astro aqui na china
1401766 queremos mostrar bom futebol de in cio claro que o resultado uma preocupa o mas se voc jogar bem o placar vir naturalmente a minha maior decep o ser se jogarmos mal e ainda perdermos seria uma desilus o
1401767 durante estes dois anos no chelsea me submeti a duas opera es e sofri uma grave les o nas costas

1401775 ele um jogador que at esconde les o para jogar tanto que jogou o pan de 2007 machucado nunca houve problema com ele
1401776 a nica informa o que eu tenho de que o jaqson havia pedido dispensas por problemas pessoais mas n o quero comentar o caso sem antes falar com o chefe de equipe
1401777 estou t o surpreso com essa not cia como voc s jornalistas os atletas que foram convocados para as olimp adas n o ficaram com o clube nas ltimas semanas e nem disputaram o campeonato paulista ficaram todos a servi o da confedera o
1401778 isso mostra que o botafogo est bem servido nas mais variadas posi es e que n o temos apenas um time com 11 titulares mas sim um grupo
1401779 estamos conseguindo fechar os espa os dos nossos advers rios porque o que estamos planejando em termos t ticos est dando certo l gico mas tamb m evidente que existe uma grande solidariedade dentro de campo entre os jogadores que se desdobram para evitar que o advers rio jogue o preparo f sico tamb m tem colaborado bastante pois permite essa entrega
1401780 fico satisfeito por estar conseguindo corresponder confian a que o botafogo depositou em mim quando me contratou e me manteve no elenco meu pensamento quando entro em campo sempre o de fazer o melhor e ajudar o time a conquistar vit rias
1401781 what theyre going to try is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
1401782 playing the race card from the bottom of the deck
1401783 slimy foul poisonous designed to exploit the hostility anxiety and resentment of the many white americans who are still freakishly hung up on the idea of black men rising above their station and becoming sexually involved with white women
1401784 the violence has spiked even as the number of foreign troops in afghanistan nears its highest level since 2001
1401785 some of our allies do not want to fight or they impose caveats on where when and how their forces may be used
1401786 yet we struggle to sustain a deployment of less than 30 000 non u s forces in afghanistan
1401787 and we are forced to scrounge for a handful of helicopters
1401788 after the long talks we held it was clear for us that what happened on july 22 was a big conspiracy and very dangerous for the democratic and constitutional process of iraq in particular against the kurds
1401789 kurds are for the distribution of authority in kirkuk but not equally dividing it
1401790 once i was in jordan and was offered some stamps dating back thousands of years by a man who said he got the items from a friend in iraq
1401791 a piece that values more than 50 000 dollars was being sold to me for less than 1 000 and acquired by him for about 10 dollars
1401792 the history of mesopotamia that is still undiscovered is under serious risk of being lost at the hands of thieves
1401793 even children are being used to search for artefacts without minimum of experience in how excavate
1401794 the government has forgotten that in such places millions of dollars are under the ground urgent measures should be taken to prevent iraq from losing more of its history and culture
1401795 this is a critical problem today since looting of archaeological sites and plundering of historic buildings continue unabated
1401796 illicit excavation at archaeological sites continues to destroy the iraqi heritage in particular in the southern region at such important sites as isin umma and umm al aqarib
1401797 lack of security is the main issue leaving archaeological sites vulnerable to gangs that use inexperienced people to excavate and destroy places that hold an ancient and exclusive worlds history
1401798 more investments should be channelled into this area but unfortunately it has been put aside the government has an obligation to preserve iraqs history more than anyone else
1401799 if even children are excavating the sites you can image how deteriorated they are the police are closing their eyes to the issue and the government is far from the subject archaeologists in iraq who try to help are being threatened by black market gangs
1401800 there arent enough staffers to protect the sites no investments and even electricity is rare making it impossible for security guards to keep monitoring during night periods
1401801 if we dont get the antiques maybe even the americans will just like they are taking our petrol
1401802 we sell to people who will take care of it and in the meantime we are feeding our families with this income
1401803 there isnt governments follow up and anyone can pick such pieces from the places i buy per bag from two youth of babel who come every week with many new items
1401804 these people who are excavating and selling have no idea of what they are selling and have no enough culture to differentiate between the items
1401805 for them everything is just pieces dated very old that can be exchanged for a plate of food or some clothes
1401806 i know this business is illegal but the government should stop the ones who are digging for the artefacts and not businessman
1401807 at least some stuff are being protected by being sold to experts and collectors
1401808 it is much better than leaving so important items mixed with garbage or destroyed by military operations in the areas
1401809 after i looked at the programmes of real madrid and oranje i came to the conclusion it is too heavy a burden because of the necessary physical effort
1401810 i have no other choice im taking no chances and after the enjoyable euro 2008 finals i can look back upon my decision with a good feeling
1401811 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in

1401844 while these networks have provided immense value for the growing transitioning space they are all controlled now by venture capitalists which tend to have as their primary objective a sale
1401845 aside from the hit shows which have spawned the networks most of the other shows on these networks have not lived up to their predecessors content wise and new shows are often canceled soon after they are launched
1401846 instead of gaining capital to burn while continuing to build or seek an advertising solution we now have one of the most prominent advertising solutions out there
1401847 along with increased distribution a road map for expansion and a guarantee that i believe is an unprecedented deal for this space

1402099 one interesting thing about indoor air pollution is that there are unique chemical reactions going on in the air between and among chemicals
1402100 people have done the analysis and found a synthesis of new compounds some of which are clearly toxic through a variety of mechanisms
1402101 if you talk to a toxicologist you always have to talk about dose
1402102 from what we could see and test there was nothing but a slight aggravation of allergies and we did the worst case scenario
1402103 they sampled too few vehicles and too few chemicals to say anything definitive
1402104 we have seen considerable variability among vehicles depending on the manufacturer and the type of interior trim he did not specify the materials or the vehicle make
1402105 we all know that some people are more sensitive to smells than others
1402106 sometimes if you dont feel well you say why and you start looking for reasons
1402107 to put this in some context these reductions would mean that voc levels in our vehicles would be at less than current limits set in japan for new buildings
1402108 also it should be understood that this is not a simple task of replacing one interior material for another it is still necessary to validate a test that can assess the complex interaction of interior materials that may result in voc emissions
1402109 everyone gets into a new car and says oh i smell something
1402110 sometimes when someone has read something like the ecology centers report it makes them unduly concerned
1402111 minutes after smith walks into the locker room and slaps this entry was posted on tuesday august 5th 2008 at 12 00 pm and is filed under football
1402112 we are appealing to anyone who may have been in the area around the time of the incident to come forward
1402113 we would like to speak to an elderly man who was in the company of two youngsters possibly his grandchildren in the golden dragon takeaway on mossbay road at about 10pm on thursday night
1402114 it is important that anyone who was in the area or who thinks they may have information which may help us in this investigation contacts us on 0845 33 00 247
1402115 this blog is all about whatever is on my mind usually my business my missions yes i have more than one and that includes more than one dharma hard to believe huh my concern that so much ignorance and greed in this world is rewarded while there are so many people in our communities that need help one thing at a time
1402116 the foundation my parents provided was the foundation that meant the most to me in every aspect of my life
1402117 i know weve had visitors from carlisle penrith keswick and workington which is fantastic for everyone here
1402118 we have 80 scarecrows this year and it takes about four hours to walk round and see them all using our special trail guide people can then vote for their favourites
1402119 this year photographs of all the entries are going on a website which means people anywhere can register their vote
1402120 we always knew there was an incredible community spirit in the village but the festival has proved that everyone wants to get involved it is wonderful
1402121 that is my favourite day seeing all the village young and old alike turning up to enjoy themselves it gives me a real buzz
1402122 i have never heard sheriff white admonish the bush administration
1402123 it was unfortunate what happened and it took longer than we wanted
1402124 he managed to get onto the track briefly and was pointing things out to the jockeys before the ground staff asked him to back off
1402125 it was a fantastic night and it seems as if more and more women really make an effort
1402126 its becoming a real tradition for people who seem to pencil it into their diaries and plan their outfits the outfits seem to get better every year
1402127 this site would be much more convenient not only for residents of denton holme and longsowerby but also for some in morton
1402128 all of these districts have a significant elderly population a number of whom do not have their own transport
1402129 travel to hilltop heights would be most inconvenient probably involving a change of buses or worse for many an expensive taxi journey
1402130 denton holme is poorly served for medical services and residents have expressed concern about this for some time
1402131 surely there is little point in building such a medical centre if any improvement in the services it offers is negated by difficulty of access
1402132 denton holme is much more accessible for many of the patients registered with these practices
1402133 i believe that the new university of cumbria will be built close to denton holme bringing many students who would seek treatment or advice from a super surgery within walking distance
1402134 the distance between denton holme and the cumberland infirmary can be covered faster should any patients need to be transferred to the hospital from the surgery
1402135 the hilltop heights site is very much out of the way for most people and does not appear to be a patient friendly area as the steep hill could be hazardous in the winter months for drivers and other patients especially those with a disability wheelchair bound or the elderly
1402136 what the hell are we supposed to do complement mccain
1402137 sure i guess i could say hes more qualified and deep down hell do the right thing but that really doesnt help us win the white house hmmm im going to vote for mccain
1402138 sure im gonna vote in the election whatever do i look like im a hundred years old and care gross no if i had to vote itd be for bush no hes running again yeah he is the white guy talking bout stuff on tv whatever
1402139 i cant believe how racist our name is im suing us
1402140 well i must say that i dont necessarily agree with the findings
1402141 i fact my patients oh god this isnt the life i wanted when i was a kid i wanted to be a cowboy not a guy who searches other guys crevices sorry im so sorry i guess ive always felt this way and seeing the look of disgust when demonstrating the procedure well it just affirmed what i was feeling say how bout an exam on the house
1402142 i didnt fight in korea to have some ethnic slur lover put his paws in my old timey swear word deleted nurse i need my socks no i need more socks these are as thin as a really disturbing sexual and racial epithet omitted thats right i killed a lot of women in korea
1402143 hey we have a lot on our plate right now for instance what do we do with people coming back from china we cant incinerate all of them can we
1402144 who would win in a fight captain crunch or snap crackle amp pop yeah were serious
1402145 competencia desleal ya que ning n artista tiene esa promoci n
1402146 given our move into this activity we are always open to connecting with additional strategic players who want to buy projects
1402147 they know how lucrative a strong wind project can be especially after commissioning
1402148 essentially silences the special nurturing voice of mister rogers in the daily lives of todays children
1402149 i have now reached the point at which i no longer care whether or not the answer is nuclear
1402150 wenn das bundeswirtschaftsministerium an konzepten zum wiedereinstieg bastelt ist das nicht nur ein klarer versto gegen den koalitionsvertrag
1402151 es zeigt vor allem dass im hause glos reiner atom lobbyismus betrieben wird
1402152 zur klima und enerergiepolitik der bundesregierung ist alles wesentliche im koalitionsvertrag festgelegt
1402153 verlogener propagandatarif weil er die gesellschaftlichen kosten der atomkraft unterl gt
1402154 um die bestehenden strukturen im sinne des energiekartells zu erhalten
1402155 eine verl ngerung der laufzeit um nur acht jahre ist wenig
1402156 weil die berufsgenossenschaften es finanziell gar nicht tragen k nnten f r s mtliche sch den aufzukommen kommen die betroffenen nicht zu ihrem recht
1402157 das gericht hat sich eingehend mit der bedeutung des krankheitsverlaufs nach ende der l sungsmitteleinwirkung auseinandergesetzt und hierzu entsprechende sachverst ndigengutachten eingeholt
1402158 hat dieses urteil f r unser system der rechtsfindung eine sehr bedenkliche konsequenz
1402159 nat rlich sorgen wir uns um die stimmung im team wir holen gute spieler dazu aber auch die teamchemie ist wichtig
1402160 ich will ja nicht sagen dass er in houston nicht willkommen ist ich hoffe einfach dass er keine zuschauer mehr angreift
1402161 ich werde mich nicht ndern ich bin immer noch einer aus dem ghetto yao hat wohl noch nicht mit einem schwarzen gespielt der seine kultur so repr sentiert wie ich
1402162 ich bin mir nicht sicher was er damit meint aber wenn das in einem gemeinsamen besuch von artest und ming bei den black panthers endet wird es interessant
1402163 ich denke nicht dass das mir gegen ber eine faire entscheidung ist
1402164 wenn er mich schl gt kann er die troph e gern haben
1402165 ron ist einer dieser spieler die den unterschied ausmachen einer den jedes team gerne h tte er ist einer der k rperbetontesten aggressivsten spieler die ich je trainiert habe
1402166 mit einem positiven artest sind die rockets ganz klar ein titelfavorit dann kann sich das management auf die schulter klopfen
1402167 ich liebe es einfach zu verteidigen jetzt wo ich so viele offensivkr fte um mich habe kann ich meinen teil dazu beitragen und meine st rken ausspielen
1402168 i dont know all the facts so thats tough for me to say
1402169 but what i can tell you emphatically is that this is not behavior that is reflective of the good judgment we should have a right to expect from public officials
1402170 perhaps some of the democrats know there are more shoes left to drop regarding ben westlund
1402171 is it fair to bring this up no it is not for three reasons first of all westlund admitted his errors most politicians dont second the victim a fellow state representative has acknowledged that the issue is resolved and is good friends with westlund third bringing up such private controversial matters can have the unexpected result of throwing the victim a new set of problems when sexual harassment charges get tossed around by outside parties it can lead to other women being afraid to pursue their complaints
1402172 were a conservative community and were just trying to make our students more reflective of that
1402173 in mailand wurden die soldaten mit applaus begr t als die aktion sichere stra en angefangen hat und 140 milit rs auf pferden eingetroffen sind
1402174 wir sind hier um die sicherheit zu garantieren aber im vergleich zu meinen erfahrungen in bagdad ist das hier ein spaziergang
1402175 au er verbrechern vergewaltigern und r ubern sind nur noch die post 68er gegner dieser sicherheitsma nahme
1402176 wir haben sogar angst dass die milit rs ungeeignet sind um die ffentliche ordnung zu sch tzen sie k nnen marschieren und schie en aber das brauchen wir nicht
1402177 dieter hennig hat seit vielen jahren eine klare linie in der ioc berichterstattung gefahren dabei hat er dem kanon der internationalen berichterstattung oft auff llig widersprochen auf eine unterstellt unkritische weise
1402178 wir als sportinformationsdienst sind dazu verpflichtet differenziert zu berichten ber alle aspekte also auch die umst nde der olympischen spiele
1402179 i think weve kind of hit the nail on the head
1402180 its easy for baristas to implement and its easy for customers to understand
1402181 certainly a discounting approach could lead to a better perception of value in the short run but the longer term question remains at the regular everyday price point would the consumer still see starbucks as offering the right value for them
1402182 the reserve should only be used in the event of an emergency and that we shouldnt be tapping the reserve to provide a small short term decrease in gas prices
1402183 i do not believe that we should use the strategic oil reserves at this point
1402184 well it is a simple rule of supply and demand i know it is a hard concept for democrats to figure out
1402185 on june 10 john b hess a top executive at the oil company with his family name summoned friends to the 21 club a former speakeasy in manhattan and delivered 285 000 to john mccain and the republican national committee
1402186 a week later mccain traveled to texas and announced his support for offshore oil drilling
1402187 hess corp is an east coast gasoline retailer with major refining and exploration operations some of which happen to be offshore in the gulf of mexico
1402188 hess was one of half a dozen hosts who tapped friends for the maximum 28 500 donation to the gop others included investor henry kravis and hedge fund mogul paul e singer
1402189 i dont want to answer your question so i am going to pretend i dont hear you move
1402190 arent as troubled as some of us older folks are by reading that doesnt go in a line
1402191 thats a good thing because the world doesnt go in a line and the world isnt organized into separate compartments or chapters
1402192 they provide no measurable substitute for the intellectual and personal development initiated and sustained by frequent reading
1402193 its not on call at the touch of the finger learning is acquired mainly from books and most readily from great books
1402194 reading opens up doors to places that you probably will never get to visit in your lifetime to cultures to worlds to people
1402195 just then i notice like finally something sharp right in front of me
1402196 i gladly took it just like that until something terrible happen
1402197 you could add your own character and twist it the way you want it to be
1402198 but you could make it so that person doesnt die or make it so like somebody else dies who you dont like
1402199 no ones ever said you should read more books to get into college
1402200 what we are losing in this country and presumably around the world is the sustained focused linear attention developed by reading
1402201 i would believe people who tell me that the internet develops reading if i did not see such a universal decline in reading ability and reading comprehension on virtually all tests
1402202 what the net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation
1402203 these were kids who would typically not be reading in their free time
1402204 the question is does it change your brain in some beneficial way
1402205 the brain is malleable and adapts to its environment whatever the pressures are on us to succeed our brain will try and deal with it
1402206 reading a book and taking the time to ruminate and make inferences and engage the imaginational processing is more cognitively enriching without doubt than the short little bits that you might get if youre into the 30 second digital mode
1402207 it takes a long time to read a 400 page book
1402208 cover a lot more of the topic from different points of view
1402209 on the internet you can hear from a bunch of people
1402210 they may not be pedigreed academics they may be someone in their shed with a conspiracy theory but you would weigh that
1402211 kids are using sound and images so they have a world of ideas to put together that arent necessarily language oriented
1402212 books arent out of the picture but theyre only one way of experiencing information in the world today
1402213 they go through a lot of details that arent really needed
1402214 online just gives you what you need nothing more or less
1402215 i think its just more comfortable and i hate to say easier but it more meets the needs of somebody who might not be a fluent reader
1402216 based on where technology is going and the world is going
1402217 kids are smart when they want to do something schools dont have to get involved
1402218 are going to grow up having to be highly competent on the internet
1402219 theres no reason to make them discover how to be highly competent if we can teach them
1402220 some of it is the informal reading they get in e mails or on web sites
1402221 i was trying to imagine this and i was like i cant do this
1402222 just give me your zip code and i can tell you your wealth right in austin
1402223 we dont have a level playing field but when campbell elementary school can go exemplary we know that everyone can do it
1402224 ive been 35 years doing this this is a new world this accountability
1402225 you see you have five subject areas and five subgroups thats 25 cells you must make every one of them
1402226 its about a sense of urgency pay now or you pay five times as much at the big house weve gotta stop our young men from going to huntsville weve got to get them literate
1402227 you know my problem isnt a few kids skipping school its a lot of kids coming and skipping classes

1402233 i accept your nomination for president of the united states but in all good conscience must reject the tactics that are being used to win that office for myself and my party
1402234 i take my text tonight from a source familiar to us all but too easily forgotten in the heat of political battle for what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul
1402235 my friends i have tried to serve my country all my life with honor and i will not trade that accomplishment for any office no matter how exalted
1402236 in the past months i have given in to the temptation to allow people who speak for me to paint my opponent as dishonest deceitful and untrustworthy from my own experience as his senate colleague i know that is simply not true
1402237 from this moment all that will stop in my heart i believe i am better qualified to lead this country and i will make my case to anyone who will listen but i will not be part of a process that demeans others for my own advantage and damages the civilized american dialogue that has been the glory of our democracy for more than two centuries

1402291 further delay arising from the rma process cannot be in the public interest when we are dealing with a project of this significance being advanced during a time when the country is crying out for investment in renewable electricity generation

1402307 im determined to reduce the amount of ghg emissions we generate here in nevada and i look forward to reviewing this report and its recommendations for how to accomplish this goal
1402308 its going around we start to see a few cases as much as two years before a presidential election but by the time the election rolls around its nearly epidemic the symptoms include as you described general fatigue and stress which is brought on by too much election coverage and analysis
1402309 well you also have a touch of both john mccain pneumonia and the barack obama flu the symptoms are nausea and the inability to stomach any more malarkey juvenile name calling or empty promises

1402314 the many new distribution paths are causing an increase in the demand for music use rights in view of this fact we believe that building a business for the management and exploitation of such rights in europe is an attractive proposition we want to take advantage of our opportunities and position ourselves with the strong well established bmg brand and a management that is highly regarded in the market
1402315 i am confident that by building this new business under the historic bmg brand we will continue to be successful in shaping the music industry the activities of bertelsmanns various divisions coupled with the realignment of bmg provide countless opportunities for us to put together attractive service packages for creatives and rights owners our top priority will be to assert the rights owners claims efficiently and protect their interests against a backdrop of increasingly complex use and distribution models

1402321 this certification is another important step forward in helping exelons customers reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with their energy use a key component of our recently announced exelon 2020 plan
1402322 has played a key role in the administrations efforts to engage the private sector in advancing and deploying efficiency and renewable energy technologies
1402323 he has been instrumental in accelerating the research and development of cellulosic biofuels solar wind geothermal and tidal power as well as advanced vehicle battery storage and hydrogen fuel cells
1402324 with meaningful policy and leadership in place the united states is now on track to be a global leader in clean energy technology development deployment and diffusion transforming global challenges into economic opportunity
1402325 but it will take the sustained multigenerational collaborative efforts and leadership of policy makers our entrepreneurs scientists engineers and commercial developers and a robust response capital markets to bring about the transformation our nation seeks and our world needs
1402326 the stringent emission reduction targets combined with substantial new investments in energy conservation and efficiency and increased reliance on homegrown renewable power will establish wisconsin as a national leader on climate change while helping the state achieve greater energy independence in the years to come
1402327 the science of climate modeling has matured through finer spatial resolution the inclusion of a greater number of physical processes and through comparison to a rapidly expanding array of observations
1402328 an average over the set of models clearly provides climate simulation superior to any individual model
1402329 no current model is superior to others in all respects but rather different models have differing strengths and weaknesses
1402330 the limestone expansion is part of our program to invest in texas with a balanced portfolio of nuclear gas wind and coal
1402331 we have appreciated working with environmental defense fund and the tcacc to bring this additional power to texas in an environmentally responsible manner and dramatically lower overall average emissions including co2
1402332 one of the main goals of the wind for schools program is to provide tools that will enable wind energy education at all levels
1402333 this is a tremendous opportunity for our states teachers and students to build a fundamental knowledge of wind energy and form an interest in professional careers such as electrical and mechanical engineering and renewable energy

1402375 i think the opposite to mourinho i dont need to win to be sure of what i do
1402376 i think that if i would have been the one to ask abramovich for lampard he would have come to juventus
1402377 i am in italy to work hard rather than take part in a war of words
1402378 i want to do well with inter and do the best possible for us and to forget about the work of others
1402379 ranieri i guess hes right with what he said i am very demanding of myself and i have to win to be sure of things
1402380 this is why i have won so many trophies in my career ranieri on the other hand has the mentality of someone who doesnt need to win he is almost 70 years old
1402381 he has won a supercup and another small trophy and he is too old to change his mentality
1402382 i think its best to leave the august controversies behind they will pass with time just like football matches
1402383 however mourinho has shown everyone what he is really like his true personality and what he thinks of his colleagues
1402384 it will be very difficult for him to take charge of a team who has won two consecutive titles and expected to win everything
1402385 what is mourinho trying to say that other coaches in serie a are trying to avoid hard work
1402386 in italy we have some excellent coachs even amongst the younger ones
1402387 all this stuff about punctuality and precision every coach expects this not just him

1402403 these states are ones you learn about in introductory quantum mechanics classes but no one has been able to controllably create them before
1402404 in quantum mechanics the energy or amplitude of motion of this pendulum only comes in finite steps in quanta we first carefully prepared the resonator in these quantum states and showed we could do this controllably and then measure the states then we kicked the pendulum directly a method where the amplitude can take on any value and appears to not be limited to these quanta but when we look at the resonator with our qubit we see that the amplitude does come in steps but that the resonator is actually in several such states at the same time so that on average it looks like it is not limited to the quantum states
1402405 this resonator once you excite it has to swing for a very long time
1402406 the first samples i fabricated stopped oscillating very quickly we had to work to rearrange the fabrication method to get the resonator to oscillate longer
1402407 harmonic oscillators might allow us to get a quantum computer built more quickly
1402408 humans seem to be wired to look to faces to understand the persons intentions
1402409 people are always asking themselves does this person have good or bad intentions

1402411 but in the long term im concerned about conferring resistance if youre talking about resistance on a broad scale it could jeopardize future treatment for mothers and infants
1402412 it reinforces the need to treat these women with combination therapy thereby providing better prevention for the infant while providing better treatment for the mother
1402413 public health efforts should continue to expand combination therapy so that mothers and babies arent left vulnerable to drug resistance

1402472 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat

1402484 i am delighted that we have reached agreements with sky sports and five which demonstrates their commitment to cricket in england and wales
1402485 we held extensive talks with all broadcasters and were determined to be as flexible as possible in terms of our packaging and scheduling to allow the maximum number of bids for cricket from all areas of the broadcast industry
1402486 the ecb recognise and are grateful for sky sports loyalty to the sport both at home and when the england team tour overseas
1402487 we are absolutely delighted to have renewed our contract with the ecb for another four years as cricket enters an exciting new era
1402488 our commitment to showing exclusive free to air highlights of englands test matches and one day internationals in peak time together with the high quality of our programmes produced by sunset vine has been the key to the success of the our coverage
1402489 test match cricket has consistently delivered excellent audiences in the 7 15pm slot men in the abc1 social economic group as well as a family audience which has been very well received by advertisers

1402494 since we got back our biggest enemy has been hunger since most of us lack the means to support ourselves
1402495 we talk to the community to identify widows orphans and other vulnerable groups and then we send our staff to the area to assess the situation before starting the reconstruction activities
1402496 reconciliation is an issue that adra is involved in we undertake activities aimed at reconciling various communities because lasting peace can only be achieved if the communities agree to live in harmony
1402497 in ituri we are now in the post conflict phase and we are trying to undertake activities that will enhance the peace
1402498 in many cases their land was occupied after they left and their return risks provoking new unrest
1402499 bridges were destroyed during fighting some roads are impassable and this affects the delivery of humanitarian aid especially to remote parts of the district
1402500 the disease was most recently reported in fataki area not very far from bunia where 74 were infected and three died
1402501 however efforts have been made to bring the disease under control with the ministry of health who world health organization msf m decins sans fronti res and others deploying medical teams to the affected areas
1402502 in ituri there are over 70 children in conflict with the law 57 are in prison in bunia alongside three babies who are accompanying their mothers
1402503 there are 11 children in mahagi with their own compound in the prison and there are three in aru who are held alongside the adults no separation
1402504 we apply the law for example such and such a child is considered dangerous and should be held by the state until the age of 21 but in the absence of appropriate facilities the secure place for this child is a prison
1402505 this had led to abuses of such children we have had instances of rape of minors in prison
1402506 as it is the main problem for the children in prison is lack of food
1402507 in mahagi for example caritas a catholic aid agency used to feed the child prisoners twice a week on tuesday and friday however caritas stopped this feeding programme in november 2007 and since then the children in detention have had to rely on their families to bring them food however this is not easy as some of the children have been abandoned by the families
1402508 a few weeks ago i was in mahagi at the prison and i heard a child crying loudly and incessantly when i inquired why the child was crying i learnt that it was a 10 year old boy who last ate on friday yet our visit was on a monday
1402509 this is an example of a short term measure there are no long term measures to address the plight of children in conflict with the law
1402510 maintains an operational capacity that allows it to launch hit and run operations against fardc the drc army clashes have halted returns of internally displaced persons in parts of ituri the fragile security situation poses a serious threat to the strengthening of community reintegration and recovery processes in some areas of ituri
1402511 the third phase of the ddr which undp coordinated has been largely successful but we have about 12 000 ex combatants from the first and second phases who did not receive anything at all by the time the programme was suspended
1402512 we know that the government has signed on to resume the programme but this will take time what happens to these people in the meantime
1402513 the district now has more schools more shopping centres and health centres and economic activities have resumed across much of ituri
1402514 we have adopted a community security approach whereby we conduct a diagnosis to help us identify what the population considers to be the factors of risk for them
1402515 our assessment is that there is still a lot to be done to disarm local communities
1402516 people have not surrendered weapons because the level of reconciliation is still very low this was an inter communal war from the beginning and people still dont feel secure this is largely because the state is still absent in a way
1402517 until recently the security forces the police and army were also a source of insecurity that didnt inspire people who saw them as enemies that it was time to disarm
1402518 the government is notorious for its corruption there is no vision to establish the management required in a post conflict situation
1402519 if one child tells you i want to be a tailor if in his village there are only a few people after a short while he will run out of a market for his products then what he will become susceptible to re recruitment into the militia groups
1402520 some militia leaders have said they do not go looking for the children to recruit the children go to them in search of something to eat and something to occupy them
1402521 we suspect that instead of letting the children come out through this channel the militias just chased them away
1402522 as a result a lot of children just found their way back to the community unofficially these are the ones that coopi is now dealing with after an identification process through the help of the local community
1402523 eventually our plans are for the achievement system to become an account based system
1402524 your wow score would be just one factor that will go into your blizzard level and rather than call it a score we just wanted it to be like youre leveling up on blizzard games

1402529 there are legislative proposals to create other free ports by other politicians in other remote areas
1402530 the issue here is whether it is illegal to import a banned item
1402531 the cagayan economic zone authority has been faithful in collecting taxes and other duties for imported cars we have no report of any car smuggling because importers are really paying their taxes
1402532 s pecial purpose vehicles like fire trucks ambulances and hearses
1402533 it is good to free people to decongest the prisons but we deplore the fact that the measure is marred by discrimination
1402534 the peace agreement has failed to silence the guns and the people of eastern congo continue to suffer and to run for their lives
1402535 the parties to the agreement must urgently redouble their efforts to act on the commitments they made to protect civilians

1402549 we should consider the voluntary disarmament as an encouraging gesture
1402550 since 2006 we have not seen the surrender of a group as important as the fdlr forces d mocratiques pour la lib ration du rwanda or one of its dissident factions
1402551 how can you not like it i wish i could understand that
1402552 woahwoahwoah you have xanax for panic attacks howd you get them

1402557 hes resting quietly and has some fractures nothing life threatening nothing permanent
1402558 we followed him and tracked the whole thing from day one
1402559 with a little more luck i might have been able to ask you to be my vice president
1402560 solzhenitsyn was one of the most important people in the history of russia he wrote exactly what he thought and needed to be remembered
1402561 its a shame that not all young people understand how important he is
1402562 the young know he wrote important books about the camps and that he received the nobel prize but thats all we really know hes more important for the older generations
1402563 but recently in politics for russia its not clear what he has done
1402564 he became one of the main battering rams in destroying both the state and nation that is why he is being applauded so rapturously by both russian president medvedev and u s president bush
1402565 la verdad es que los usuarios de windows est n m s acostumbrados a tratar con spyware anuncios
1402566 debido a que ha habido muchos menos ataques contra mac os x y linux sus usuarios no se han visto forzados a luchar contra estos ataques muchos de los est n satisfechos con sus seguridad y no se han dado cuenta de la necesidad de un software antivirus como el mercado alternativo a windows crece los hackers inevitablemente atacar n este objetivo siendo los usuarios de mac los m s frecuentes desde sophos no pretendemos crear una psicosis pero advertimos que los usuarios de mac y linux tendr n problemas m s serios
1402567 im the most frugal person you will ever meet the fact that i would consider donating to a campaign you better know i must be inspired
1402568 im paying for college out of my own pockets and teaching is one of those professions where if you are trying to do it on your own you need a second job
1402569 it makes me very proud my family have all been rovers fans
1402570 ron has done a fantastic job its going to be a tough act to follow i feel very excited about things
1402571 the stadium is very close to my heart with my background in the construction industry
1402572 ive always wanted to see rovers run out into a new stadium and obviously thats going to be one of my main priorities
1402573 were getting on quite well so were really hopeful that things will be back on track before long
1402574 the chances of any normal human being taking the time to add incredibly valuable meta data to the great wads of digital data they create daily approximates zero
1402575 most people would prefer root canal work than the utter tedium and ambient feeling of futility that accompanies meta data creation besides everyone is too busy oh and besides that again it always seems to be more fun to create new stuff than to create stuff about old stuff
1402576 any gadget technique or service that adds even vaguely useful meta data without requiring significant human intervention will find a very receptive market out there
1402577 we have many redirections solutions and agendas that are ignored by john mccain and barack obama were the ones who are single payer full medicare for all
1402578 mobile gaming will never be the same as the zeemote js1 launches through our first commercial relationship with sony ericsson

1402584 wow it looks awesome i first wanted to highly commend you and your staff of how precise you guys are with our revisions
1402585 the fact is drilling in protected areas offshore will not reduce the price at the pump
1402586 big oil with its billions of dollars in record profits wants more taxpayer lands and republicans are happy to oblige
1402587 give us an opportunity give us an opportunity to vote
1402588 we had hoped that what wed be doing today is debating an energy bill debate an increase in deep sea exploration debate onshore exploration debate clean coal technology debate building a new refinery in the united states debate oil shale technology
1402589 but instead what we have to do because the cameras are off and the microphones are off is to come and give voice to the american people
1402590 you are the eyes and ears of the american people today
1402591 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1402592 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day

1402594 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1402595 i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip
1402596 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1402597 we have strengthened security in all olympic venues and in the olympic village we are well prepared to deal with any kind of threat
1402598 fights between uighurs and han chinese happen about every day on different kinds of scale
1402599 its a shame when we have all these economic problems that the same people who cant afford to pay for their homes are willing to dash to the newsstands and feed the frenzy that causes magazine editors to spend millions
1402600 its a reflection of the appetite for seeing the children of celebs and also our big interest in judging other mothers
1402601 we are delighted that all proceeds from these stunning images will once again be donated entirely to charity through the jolie pitt foundation
1402602 its either the biggest photo victory ever or the biggest black eye on the journalism business you could imagine
1402603 i used to say its a gamble but now i think its a sure bet they will make it all back maybe not in a specific issue but in free publicity and promotion from the articles even negative ones that will be written about them
1402604 anyone who thinks that will stop the stalkerazzi theyre wrong it didnt work in the old days and it doesnt work now no matter how much money is out there
1402605 in our business there are almost no rules so the fact that the stars are turning the business on its head is probably a natural progression
1402606 the women who read our blog especially the new mothers they feel a connection to these celebrities as if they were family members so theres a natural inclination to want to see the baby pictures of someone you care about
1402607 if a practice is wrong it doesnt matter what the consequences are
1402608 sharing baby photos with family and friends is one thing but having these images put on magazines and on the internet forever is a different story
1402609 looking to the future new directions in hiv aids research
1402610 it is a miracle for me because i was able to smile again laugh again and just feel alive again
1402611 i had to make sacrifices and i dream of the day some day when everyone can afford to clone their pet because losing a pet is a terrible terrible loss to anyone

1402630 four prisoners died on sunday 13 in mbuji mayis central prison in kasai oriental province due to severe malnutrition
1402631 our biggest worry is that many of the dead were on remand and therefore enjoyed a presumption of innocence as they had yet to be tried due to the slowness of the legal process
1402632 we have already sounded the alarm several times but nothing has changed people in the prison are living skeletons because of hunger they are just skin and bone
1402633 we need to decongest the prison the current system cannot accommodate more prisoners
1402634 there is enough maize flour fish and soap available for the prison and a medical sanitary structure for the prisoners
1402635 prison maintenance should be the central governments work but unfortunately the ministry of justice does not support us
1402636 i know how much the auto industry and the autoworkers of this state have struggled over the last decade or so
1402637 but i also know where i want the fuel efficient cars of tomorrow to be built not in japan not in china but right here in the united states of america right here in the state of michigan
1402638 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1402639 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1402640 this will not be easy and it will not happen overnight
1402641 talking about his plan to provide an immediate energy rebate to americans who are struggling with high gas prices create five million new green jobs and eliminate our need for middle eastern oil over the course of the next ten years
1402642 right now the obama campaign has at least 15 offices open in the state and they plan to open about a dozen more

1402648 if theres any year where a democrat can win alaska this is the year
1402649 weve always voted up here just nobodys paid much attention
1402650 i dont remember that there ever was a real democratic campaign in christian county or that a presidential candidate opened an office here
1402651 times are a changing which can be attributed to more people moving into the county and young people are more aware of whats going on
1402652 its not going to be an easy task but theyll know were here in christian county
1402653 weve never had this happen now we can come in and ask questions and talk
1402654 its a gathering place for democrats to be together weve never even been able to afford an office for our christian county democrats
1402655 i can sing in front of half a million people without a problem but i cant hit a golf ball straight in front of about 20

1402666 in anumite localitati unde organizarea a fost mai buna fortele de interventie bazate pe voluntariat au si actionat deja dar in zone precum pascani am fost informat ca lumea era mult mai tentata de ceea ce se intampla la carciumile din zona decat sa ajute fortele de interventie care sunt dislocate in zona si care trebuie sa intervina intr un interval scurt de timp
1402667 during the past 10 years i have searched for ancient monuments throughout england scotland wales and brittany
1402668 in these places there are standing stones stone circles and burial chambers that are inscribed with cup and ring marks concentric circles spirals stars rosettes and parallel grooves this rich language of marks was carved and executed by hundreds of generations of prehistoric people
1402669 i am fascinated with the distant past the passage of time and the marks that humans leave behind
1402670 i believe that the presence and sounds of all the people who made or visited these sites throughout time remains within their sphere intangible untouchable unintelligible but always present
1402671 im looking for something new and exciting to do i want to do something dark or a comedy theres tons of icons that i would love to work with on something new and exciting

1402677 social homophobia is legitimised and it increases fear amongst msm who take further risks to live their sexual life in secret
1402678 we are still fighting for msms to have access to health centres
1402679 on the continent more and more msms are organising prevention campaigns however they will never be effective whilst they are being hunted down and or imprisoned or even excluded from official strategies to combat the pandemic
1402680 in the hope that this will serve as an example for others so that there is more discussion about the illness between msms and health professionals
1402681 are not educated and ignore all or nearly all prevention methods
1402682 many msm told us they were sure that there was no risk of infection with anal penetration
1402683 many msm use butter or oil but unfortunately this damages condoms
1402684 the majority of homosexuals 88 per cent according to a study are bisexual which increases the spread of the disease

1402690 the challenge for affordable housing isnt just raising the money to build it its having the funds going forward to operate it
1402691 its really not hard to come to a good balance between reducing operating costs by improving construction and performance of new buildings
1402692 should take into account the additional capital cost in making decisions about how to finance housing
1402693 its good economic policy and at the same time it leverages the investments that were already putting into affordable housing
1402694 we can do green affordable housing currently but if we can use additional or just current resources more effectively and just target them buildings will have better performance over time
1402695 there are many jurisdictions where mayors or city councils have taken leadership positions in delivering green communities for public investment in affordable housing
1402696 to raise the skill level of people in the building trade open up new local jobs and keep the jobs here
1402697 weve seen a huge uptick in the number of green affordable housing projects
1402698 most of the activity is happening at the local level mind shift happens at the local level in a lot of places
1402699 lets us unite in common effort to chart a new course for america

1402708 it wouldnt be how we understand the operation functioning no doubt we can clear up the matter quickly
1402709 my face was pushed into the ground my arm was twisted and i was hit two or three times in the face
1402710 this is utterly unacceptable any time its particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics at a time when china has promised complete media freedom
1402711 the japanese reporters violated the rules of china by forcing their way into a military area
1402712 i decided to start blogging as a way to express myself and get out any frustrations that i had that day
1402713 but since my blog is based on my thoughts and i think all the time ok most of the time then i guess you can say i work on it all day
1402714 my blog is pretty popular with friends because i always have pictures for everyone and keep everyone posted on trail conditions and whats going on with our local trail crew central iowa trail association centraliowatrails org
1402715 i was constantly being asked what restaurant i would recommend for different occasions
1402716 and when i would dine out i would find myself constantly writing my own reviews in my head so i started this little blog both to entertain inform my friends and to give myself another writing outlet
1402717 i do not strive to have a good blog on my personal blog
1402718 top 10 states where household spending has decreased most during the economic downturn
1402719 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
1402720 i can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that race had nothing to do with it
1402721 let me give you a real live example which ive been hearing a lot about from women there are many health insurance plans that will cover viagra but wont cover birth control medication those women would like a choice

1402724 the epidemic began in the tshuapa health zone and has reached almost all parts of the province
1402725 cases of monkey pox have been registered all over tshuapa health zone but also in befale and mopono health zones and more recently in ingende health zone near mbandaka the main town in the province
1402726 the epidemic is now heading northwards to boende health zone the east is in the middle of the epidemic and isolated cases have also appeared all over the province
1402727 the disease reappeared because people here regularly eat monkeys and squirrels which are reservoirs for the virus and above all because smallpox vaccinations stopped
1402728 i have had this condition elephantiasis since i was 22 but since i fled my home after the fighting intensified i have had nothing but trouble mostly with accessing medical treatment
1402729 i used to visit a clinic at home where i got some tablets to help me but nowadays i have nothing not even painkillers i benefited only once from a medical distribution at this camp some time in march i do not have the fare let alone the money required to seek special treatment in goma
1402730 right now i just wish i had a petty job to do like washing clothes carrying water for people to use in their homes or even tilling land for them just to get something small to enable me to get treatment
1402731 before i got displaced i used to think my life was hard what with being a peasant and having this disease but it has gone from bad to worse i dont have the means to manage this disease i dont know when i will next get medical attention
1402732 my children get teased a lot by other children who tell them their mother has swollen legs i wish i could find medication that would help reduce the swelling so my children can be treated like other children donors

1402749 the headline is that at the moment us policies are out of whack
1402750 that is affecting our ability to act effectively and coherently in africa and to carry out the war on terrorism in a coherent long term and effective way
1402751 foreign aid is increasingly being overseen by military institutions whose policies are driven by the global war on terror not by the war against poverty
1402752 at the moment projects in africa are just not joining up
1402753 africom needs to stay in lane and concentrate on doing those things it should do and does well
1402754 the military should not try to take over what usaid the us agency for international development or the state department do that should be left to people trained to do that but they need more resources
1402755 the new mission statement is focused on security with no mention of humanitarian or development assistance
1402756 africom commander general ward spent a lot of time with aid organisations and the humanitarian community i think he listened and responded to what he heard and africom has been narrowing its reach as it comes closer to full command
1402757 the humanitarian community should step up efforts to address corruption and reduce corruptions risks
1402758 there remains little knowledge about the extent or consequences of corruption in humanitarian assistance little shared knowledge about preventing corruption under emergency circumstances beyond a few standard practices and a degree of taboo about confronting it publicly
1402759 sexual exploitation and coercion and intimidation of humanitarian staff or aid recipients for personal social or political gain manipulation of assessments targeting and registration to favour particular groups and diversion of assistance to non target groups
1402760 normal physical administrative legal and financial infrastructure and services have often been substantially or entirely damaged or destroyed
1402761 there may be rapid turnover of supervisory staff so there is very little accumulated knowledge of the context and very few staff at the supervisory level remain long enough to develop deeper contextual knowledge that could mitigate some of the risk of corruption

1402763 warning of a looming economic calamity gov paterson yesterday called an emergency session of the state legislature and raised the specter that new york may have to sell off roads bridges and tunnels to close a massive and still growing budget deficit
1402764 u s economy grows at solid pace in 2nd quarter
1402765 much of the improvement came from the one time bump from economic stimulus payments raising prospects of weaker performance in months ahead
1402766 looking at it from the government point of view theres a strong political motivation to understate the cpi by understating it keeps cola adjustments down on entitlements which are at this point the largest part of the governments budget and by understating cpi the government can minimize the inflationary impact on things such as rents which are indexed to cpi or wages pensions and a whole list of ancillary costs to artificially keep inflation rates down bottom line the published cpi understates the real inflation rate
1402767 while sometimes devastating these global relative price pressures are not the same thing as inflation
1402768 the fed remains skeptical that high commodity prices will ripple through the economy leading to broad price hikes and big wage increases
1402769 as consumers spend more money for higher priced petroleum and agricultural goods they eventually have less money to spend on other goods and services other relative prices must then fall
1402770 fingered exploding inflation as the biggest risk to the economy
1402771 products of public policies which deeply affect markets supply and demand consumers producers and speculators
1402772 declining capitalist investment in the productive economy the vast increase of capital flowing in the paper economy the huge increases in profits and the grotesque salaries bonuses and payoffs to senior executives totally unrelated to performance
1402773 in other words in the contemporary economy inflation benefits the wealthy because they pay their workers in deflated currency while they can take advantage of inflation to further jack up prices and then income thus the upper classes have fortified their economic positions to take account of inflation through their power over prices income and other compensations in a way that wage workers and people on fixed income and other vulnerable sectors cannot bankers protect their loans via adjustable interest rates monopoly resource owners jack up prices to retain profits wholesalers mark up prices to compensate for higher commodity prices large scale retailers squeeze final consumers the great majority at the bottom of the production and distribution chain
1402774 in asia particularly pakistan india indonesia south korea philippines nepal mongolia and china hundreds of millions of workers peasants artisans and low paid self employed workers as well as housewives and pensioners have engaged in sustained mass protests as they experience a decline in the quality and quantity of food purchases as prices skyrocket in africa hunger stalks the land and major food riots have occurred from egypt through sub saharan africa to south africa in the caribbean central and south america food riots have led to the overthrow of regimes mass protests road blockages from argentina bolivia through colombia venezuela and haiti

1402776 when i was serving a sentence on robben island during the struggle to end apartheid in south africa i never suspected that the end of white minority rule in my home country would be the beginning of yet another struggle for justice this time against the world bank and the international monetary fund
1402777 as architects of the global economy the world bank and the imf have enormous power and shape the conditions of peoples lives around the world
1402778 i live now in the united states where people so far are relatively unscathed by the reordering of the global economy for the benefit of the very rich
1402779 the imf and world bank with the structural adjustment programs saps they impose on indebted countries and their pro corporate development projects are the leading edge of oppressive globalization the policies they have imposed in africa latin america and asia have condemned people to stagnation poverty and death for twenty years and those policies are now being adopted in the countries of europe and north america too
1402780 although some of them may have tricked themselves into believing that the neo liberal economic model they defend is immutable like a law of nature most of them probably know that they are perpetrating a fraud of global proportions michael camdessus who retired after thirteen years as managing director of the imf told a group of u s religious leaders that he was willing to sacrifice a generation in order to realize the so called benefits of the macroeconomic model
1402781 given the reluctance of india and other developing nations to sacrifice food security measures in the wake of the recent global spike in food prices
1402782 the tariff cuts demanded of developing countries would have caused massive job loss and countries would have lost the ability to protect farmers from dumping further impoverishing millions on the verge of survival
1402783 we see many of the essential ingredients for a classic asset bubble said edward morse chief energy economist at lehman brothers morse estimated that 90 billion has flowed into the biggest commodity indices in just more than two years and more money has flowed into other exchanges pushing up prices
1402784 the cftcs economists are saying that supply and demand seem to be driving this but we have clients in the business that have experienced these markets for many many years and what im hearing from them is that they dont see any change in the fundamentals of supply and demand
1402785 is it a matter of institutional investors seeking shelter from the subprime crisis and the credit crunch
1402786 i dont know but i do know that speculators as a class do not agree on anything and yet there is almost unanimity of opinion these days and the money to make the opinions matter the fact that prices have been relentlessly trending up suggests a new type of market participant with a mentality that is traditionally more in line with investing in securities than trading in commodities if enough of these wealthy people or funds or other entities with a lot of capital decide to flip out of securities for a little while and go into commodities and theyre all looking for something that is going up and you get enough billions of dollars thinking that way then their wish comes true
1402787 the situation now is that the cftc is sitting there looking at one screen one piece of the picture which is whatever is happening on the exchanges meanwhile an increasing volume in dollars is taking place in the form of over the counter activity where no one can see it there is still a blind spot with respect to the true over the counter activity that is going on which represents billions and billions of dollars
1402788 in 2000 congress decided that there were certain kinds of high end investors that were big enough and smart enough that they shouldnt be constrained to do all their business on the exchanges
1402789 public safety and preparedness agencies like the vermont state police corrections the national guard and veterans affairs will not be cut neither will debt service which the state must pay

1402792 exxon mobil corp reported second quarter earnings of 11 68 billion thursday the biggest profit from operations ever by any u s corporation
1402793 this in no way justifies the way the police are treating the camp
1402794 it is disgraceful to suggest that the campers have criminal intent
1402795 this is obviously an attempt by the police to distract us from raising issues about climate change

1402813 checking tires is particularly critical during the summer when roads are hot and families are putting a lot of miles on their cars with their vacation plans

1402821 very very serious indeed so serious that custody would be an option
1402822 both the harassment and the criminal damage offences were targeted very often to homes of the individuals involved and were vindictive in nature
1402823 by your own admission this course of action was intimidatory
1402824 the nightmare of the last three years may finally be coming to an end
1402825 this has been a traumatic period for all those who have suffered from his vile campaign to defame intimidate and terrorise people simply for expressing support for a political party
1402826 failed to investigate the matter properly and to ensure that such an appalling course of events is never repeated
1402827 this was a disgraceful and criminal campaign aimed at intimidating candidates and voters and subverting the democratic process

1402853 but wed all like to see for all our effort and hard work when we leave that there is someone to backfill for us
1402854 and that is key clearly to the future of being able to succeed in afghanistan
1402855 restricts our ability to redirect food aid dollars for emergency use at a time of great need globally the bill does not include the requested authority to buy food in the developing world to save lives
1402856 we are happy to see at least a new precedent for some funding for local purchase they never got anything in the past
1402857 i deplore the fact that the us have not learned the lessons from the past distortive impacts on local markets in recipient countries of food aid distributed in kind especially in a context where due to the increase in the prices of oil the transport of food by us ships will significantly raise the costs of providing aid and thus the net benefits for the end beneficiaries
1402858 the farm bill itself doesnt demonstrate a lot of leadership or vision about how agriculture should operate and its pretty much a validation of the status quo
1402859 not only the european union but also canada and australia have moved towards providing more of their food aid locally and regionally
1402860 the us is lagging behind even though its the leading source of food aid
1402861 when commodity prices are at record highs it is irresponsible to increase government subsidy rates for 15 crops subsidise additional crops and provide payments that further distort markets
1402862 specific factors that cause inefficiencies include 1 funding and planning processes that increase delivery costs and lengthen time frames 2 ocean transportation and contracting practices that create high levels of risk for ocean carriers resulting in increased rates 3 legal requirements that result in awarding of food aid contracts to more expensive service providers and 4 inadequate coordination between us agencies and food aid stakeholders to track and respond to food and delivery problems

1402866 listening to records used to be a time to be enjoy with a few friends hang out listen to the music and read the liner notes on the back
1402867 maybe you enjoyed the gatefold sleeves in a personal way maybe you just enjoyed slipping the sealing material off the cover on your pants by rubbing the corner of the record on your knee taking the record out getting that little
1402868 all formats have their points i just like handling vinyl i was a dj for years and used to use records to entertain in the philadelphia and new york area i didnt just play records we made a night of entertainment as for the digital sound i prefer the warmer sounds i get from vinyl
1402869 i do have a music collection and my favorite items are not necessarily rare
1402870 forever vinyl gets more than twenty calls a day for customers looking for appraisals for estates and charity donations
1402871 as far as the elements of an appraisal it depends on the needs of the customer for donations we draw a number of different elements to get the correct market value for your collection we neither under nor over appraise your collection
1402872 what makes a house value location location location when it comes to records demand demand demand age is not a determining factor in record collection demand is
1402873 there really arent any obstacles per say other then finding a non profit entity to accept them the irs is very picky about fair retail market value as they should be we should all pay our fair share of the tax burden its important to understand that the irs considers the value of a collection to be based on the value and use of the entity you are donating the collection to if you donate the collection to a university and they hold on to it for three years possibly put it in their library and make the collection available to the students to learn from the appraisal will normally stand if you donate the collection to a thrift shop the irs will normally look at what the thrift shop sold the collection for and adjust any appraisal value over that amount needless to say we highly recommend finding a charity that would value and use the collection rather then just dump the collection for pennies on the dollar
1402874 as you know many records are now valued in the hundreds and thousands of dollars because of the amount of appraisals that are requested per day weve instituted a reasonable fee to cover our cost time and expertise for these appraisals our current fee is 20 00 for the first item of the appraisal and 5 00 for each additional item for collections with over 200 pieces please call us 732 505 5337 for adjusted rates
1402875 all information must contain the following information artist title type of item condition 1 10 is fine with 10 looking like its brand new label and label number

1402938 i told them that what he did was not appropriate and i have talked to him about it what i dont understand is how you can make a police report on a 6 year old but the principal told me that they were making reports to the police every single day
1402939 there was some confusion as to what level of threat and assault we were talking about
1402940 as a result there were too many calls that may not have been necessary because of people wanting to comply with the initial request
1402941 were about incidents the police did not have to be involved in
1402942 offenses involving weapons alcohol drugs intentional injury and other serious violations
1402943 theres no way these children understand whats going on but its been taken out of our hands thats the difficult moral dilemma that we face
1402944 we need to make sure that we follow the letter of the law so being reasonable sometimes gets lost
1402945 he said if the taks scores were not as expected he would kill the teachers
1402946 he said i will kill you all and kill myself he finished the meeting that way and we were in shock obviously we talked about it among ourselves he just threatened our lives after he threatened to kill us he said you dont know how ruthless i can be
1402947 we walked out of the meeting just totally dumbfounded because it was not a joke
1402948 it was not spoken in a joking manner and it kind of alarmed him and gave him an uneasy feeling
1402949 i did not talk to the other teachers other than that it is a personnel matter and i cant talk about it we have not seen a police report
1402950 all personnel decisions are made with the best interests of students in mind
1402951 it sounds like a case of taks tyranny taken to the extreme
1402952 once a principal gets a reputation as not able to get the scores that are required that principal is virtually unemployable

1402966 having spent a good part of the last year struggling with a variety of video chat and im programs i have decided to write a few things down microsoft has serious plans to do away with windows
1402967 the plans which are far from being finalized indicate the microsoft is really running scared of mac os and linux on the desktop
1402968 over the past few years i have heard a lot of noise about how great it would be to see kde coming to windows world

1402975 try that with vista and you might soon get to meet some of microsofts nastiest lawyers upfront and very personal
1402976 are you still using a web browser to access your favourite online applications why not do things the easy way and make gnu linux free software tools to preserve your online privacy a

1402991 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
1402992 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it

1403030 and now the storm blast came and he was tyrannous and strong he struck with his oertaking wings and chased us south along with sloping masts and dipping prow as who pursued with yell and blow still treads the shadow of his foe and foward bends his head the ship drove fast loud roared the blast and southward aye we fled and now there came both mist and snow and it grew wondrous cold and ice mast high came floating by as green as emerald and through the drifts the snowy clifts did send a dismal sheen nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken the ice was all between the ice was here the ice was there the ice was all around it cracked and growled and roared and howled like noises in a swound at length did cross an albatross thorough the fog it came as it had been a christian soul we hailed it in gods name it ate the food it neer had eat and round and round it flew the ice did split with a thunder fit the helmsman steered us through and a good south wind sprung up behind the albatross did follow and every day for food or play came to the mariners hollo in mist or cloud on mast or shroud it perched for vespers nine whiles all the night through fog smoke white glimmered the white moonshine
1403031 the sun now rose upon the right out of the sea came he still hid in mist and on the left went down into the sea and the good south wind still blew behind but no sweet bird did follow nor any day for food or play came to the mariners hollo and i had done a hellish thing and it would work em woe for all averred i had killed the bird that made the breeze to blow ah wretch said they the bird to slay that made the breeze to blow nor dim nor red like gods own head the glorious sun uprist then all averred i had killed the bird that brought the fog and mist twas right said they such birds to slay that bring the fog and mist the fair breeze blew the white foam flew the furrow followed free we were the first that ever burst into that silent sea down dropped the breeze the sails dropped down twas sad as sad could be and we did speak only to break the silence of the sea all in a hot and copper sky the bloody sun at noon right up above the mast did stand no bigger than the moon day after day day after day we stuck nor breath nor motion as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean water water every where and all the boards did shrink water water every where nor any drop to drink the very deep did rot o christ that ever this should be yea slimy things did crawl with legs upon the slimy sea about about in reel and rout the death fires danced at night the water like a witchs oils burnt green and blue and white and some in dreams assured were of the spirit that plagued us so nine fathom deep he had followed us from the land of mist and snow and every tongue through utter drought was withered at the root we could not speak no more than if we had been choked with soot ah well a day what evil looks had i from old and young instead of the cross the albatross about my neck was hung
1403032 there passed a weary time each throat was parched and glazed each eye a weary time a weary time how glazed each weary eye when looking westward i beheld a something in the sky at first it seemed a little speck and then it seemed a mist it moved and moved and took at last a certain shape i wist a speck a mist a shape i wist and still it neared and neared as if it dodged a water sprite it plunged and tacked and veered with throats unslaked with black lips baked we could nor laugh nor wail through utter drought all dumb we stood i bit my arm i sucked the blood and cried a sail a sail with throats unslaked with black lips baked agape they heard me call gramercy they for joy did grin and all at once their breath drew in as they were drinking all see see i cried she tacks no more hither to work us weal without a breeze without a tide she steadies with upright keel the western wave was all a flame the day was well nigh done almost upon the western wave rested the broad bright sun when that strange shape drove suddenly betwixt us and the sun and straight the sun was flecked with bars heavens mother send us grace as if through a dungeon grate he peered with broad and burning face alas thought i and my heart beat loud how fast she nears and nears are those her sails that glance in the sun like restless gossameres are those her ribs through which the sun did peer as through a grate and is that woman all her crew is that a death and are there two is death that womans mate her lips were red her looks were free her locks were yellow as gold her skin was as white as leprosy the nightmare life in death was she who thicks mans blood with cold the naked hulk alongside came and the twain were casting dice the game is done ive won ive won quoth she and whistles thrice the suns rim dips the stars rush out at one stride comes the dark with far heard whisper oer the sea off shot the spectre bark we listened and looked sideways up fear at my heart as at a cup my life blood seemed to sip the stars were dim and thick the night the steersmans face by his lamp gleamed white from the sails the dew did drip till clomb above the eastern bar the horned moon with one bright star within the nether tip one after one by the star dogged moon too quick for groan or sigh each turned his face with a ghastly pang and cursed me with his eye four times fifty living men and i heard nor sigh nor groan with heavy thump a lifeless lump they dropped down one by one the souls did from their bodies fly they fled to bliss or woe and every soul it passed me by like the whizz of my crossbow
1403033 fear not fear not thou wedding guest this body dropped not down alone alone all all alone alone on a wide wide sea and never a saint took pity on my soul in agony the many men so beautiful and they all dead did lie and a thousand thousand slimy things lived on and so did i i looked upon the rotting sea and drew my eyes away i looked upon the rotting deck and there the dead men lay i looked to heaven and tried to pray but or ever a prayer had gusht a wicked whisper came and made my heart as dry as dust i closed my lids and kept them close and the balls like pulses beat forthe sky and the sea and the sea and the sky lay like a load on my weary eye and the dead were at my feet the cold sweat melted from their limbs nor rot nor reek did they the look with which they looked on me had never passed away an orphans curse would drag to hell a spirit from on high but oh more horrible than that is the curse in a dead mans eye seven days seven nights i saw that curse and yet i could not die the moving moon went up the sky and no where did abide softly she was going up and a star or two beside her beams bemocked the sultry main like april hoar frost spread but where the ships huge shadow lay the charmed water burnt alway a still and awful red beyond the shadow of the ship i watched the water snakes they moved in tracks of shining white and when they reared the elfish light fell off in hoary flakes within the shadow of the ship i watched their rich attire blue glossy green and velvet black they coiled and swam and every track was a flash of golden fire o happy living things no tongue their beauty might declare a spring of love gushed from my heart and i blessed them unaware sure my kind saint took pity on me and i blessed them unaware the selfsame moment i could pray and from my neck so free the albatross fell off and sank like lead into the sea
1403034 oh sleep it is a gentle thing beloved from pole to pole to mary queen the praise be given she sent the gentle sleep from heaven that slid into my soul the silly buckets on the deck that had so long remained i dreamt that they were filled with dew and when i awoke it rained my lips were wet my throat was cold my garments all were dank sure i had drunken in my dreams and still my body drank i moved and could not feel my limbs i was so light almost i thought that i had died in sleep and was a blessed ghost and soon i heard a roaring wind it did not come anear but with its sound it shook the sails that were so thin and sere the upper air burst into life and a hundred fire flags sheen to and fro they were hurried about and to and fro and in and out the wan stars danced between and the coming wind did roar more loud and the sails did sigh like sedge and the rain poured down from one black cloud the moon was at its edge the thick black cloud was cleft and still the moon was at its side like waters shot from some high crag the lightning fell with never a jag a river steep and wide the loud wind never reached the ship yet now the ship moved on beneath the lightning and the moon the dead men gave a groan they groaned they stirred they all uprose nor spake nor moved their eyes it had been strange even in a dream to have seen those dead men rise the helmsman steered the ship moved on yet never a breeze up blew the mariners all gan work the ropes where they were wont to do they raised their limbs like lifeless tools we were a ghastly crew the body of my brothers son stood by me knee to knee the body and i pulled at one rope but he said nought to me
1403035 i woke and we were sailing on as in a gentle weather twas night calm night the moon was high the dead men stood together all stood together on the deck for a charnel dungeon fitter all fixed on me their stony eyes that in the moon did glitter the pang the curse with which they died had never passed away i could not draw my eyes from theirs nor turn them up to pray and now this spell was snapped once more i viewed the ocean green and looked far forth yet little saw of what had else been seen like one that on a lonesome road doth walk in fear and dread and having once turned round walks on and turns no more his head because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread but soon there breathed a wind on me nor sound nor motion made its path was not upon the sea in ripple or in shade it raised my hair it fanned my cheek like a meadow gale of spring it mingled strangely with my fears yet it felt like a welcoming swiftly swiftly flew the ship yet she sailed softly too sweetly sweetly blew the breeze on me alone it blew oh dream of joy is this indeed the lighthouse top i see is this the hill is this the kirk is this mine own country we drifted oer the harbour bar and i with sobs did pray o let me be awake my god or let me sleep alway the harbour bay was clear as glass so smoothly it was strewn and on the bay the moonlight lay and the shadow of the moon the rock shone bright the kirk no less that stands above the rock the moonlight steeped in silentness the steady weathercock and the bay was white with silent light till rising from the same full many shapes that shadows were in crimson colours came a little distance from the prow those crimson shadows were i turned my eyes upon the deck oh christ what saw i there each corse lay flat lifeless and flat and by the holy rood a man all light a seraph man on every corse there stood this seraph band each waved his hand it was a heavenly sight they stood as signals to the land each one a lovely light this seraph band each waved his hand no voice did they impart no voice but oh the silence sank like music on my heart but soon i heard the dash of oars i heard the pilots cheer my head was turned perforce away and i saw a boat appear the pilot and the pilots boy i heard them coming fast dear lord in heaven it was a joy the dead men could not blast i saw a third i heard his voice it is the hermit good he singeth loud his godly hymns that he makes in the wood hell shrieve my soul hell wash away the albatrosss blood
1403036 this hermit good lives in that wood which slopes down to the sea how loudly his sweet voice he rears he loves to talk with marineers that come from a far country he kneels at morn and noon and eve he hath a cushion plump it is the moss that wholly hides the rotted old oak stump the skiff boat neared i heard them talk why this is strange i trow where are those lights so many and fair that signal made but now strange by my faith the hermit said and they answered not our cheer the planks looked warped and see those sails how thin they are and sere i never saw aught like to them unless perchance it were brown skeletons of leaves that lag my forest brook along when the ivy tod is heavy with snow and the owlet whoops to the wolf below that eats the young dear lord it hath a fiendish look the pilot made reply i am afeared push on push on said the hermit cheerily the boat came closer to the ship but i nor spake nor stirred the boat came close beneath the ship and straight a sound was heard under the water it rumbled on still louder and more dread it reached the ship it split the bay the ship went down like lead stunned by that loud and dreadful sound which sky and ocean smote like one that hath been seven days drowned my body lay afloat but swift as dreams myself i found within the pilots boat upon the whirl where sank the ship the boat spun round and round and all was still save that the hill was telling of the sound i moved my lips the pilot shrieked and fell down in a fit the holy hermit raised his eyes and prayed where he did sit i took the oars the pilots boy who now doth crazy go laughed loud and long and all the while his eyes went to and fro ha ha quoth he full plain i see the devil knows how to row and now all in my own country i stood on the firm land the hermit stepped forth from the boat and scarcely he could stand o shrieve me shrieve me holy man the hermit crossed his brow say quick quoth he i bid thee say what manner of man art thou forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched with a woeful agony which forced me to begin my tale and then it left me free since then at an uncertain hour that agony returns and till my ghastly tale is told this heart within me burns i pass like night from land to land i have strange power of speech that moment that his face i see i know the man that must hear me to him my tale i teach what loud uproar bursts from that door the wedding guests are there but in the garden bower the bride and bride maids singing are and hark the little vesper bell which biddeth me to prayer o wedding guest this soul hath been alone on a wide wide sea so lonely twas that god himself scarce seemed there to be o sweeter than the marriage feast tis sweeter far to me to walk together to the kirk with a goodly company to walk together to the kirk and all together pray while each to his great father bends old men and babes and loving friends and youths and maidens gay farewell farewell but this i tell to thee thou wedding guest he prayeth well who loveth well both man and bird and beast he prayeth best who loveth best all things both great and small for the dear god who loveth us he made and loveth all

1403078 i had a phone call from a friend saying st felix was on fire it is a huge blow i wouldnt be surprised if it was an arson attack
1403079 it is just lucky that the school was out as 400 people could have gone up in one foul swoop which doesnt bear thinking about
1403080 this is very sad and i feel physically sick this fire could threaten our home as i dont have any other way to pay the mortgage
1403081 this is a sad day for the whole of newmarket we didnt realise the fire was quite as bad as this i cant believe what has happened
1403082 we just thought it was a little fire but it is in fact a terrible inferno it is just a blessing that everyone was on their summer holidays at the time
1403083 st felix is a school which has a lot of things going for it a lot of youngsters in newmarket and the surrounding villages have grown up and gone to the school and i feel for the staff parents and children who currently go there and will have their education disrupted
1403084 i am gob smacked by what has happened as the school is an integral part of the town and you always expect it to be there i just hope the grim predictions about not being able to save the school turn out to be wrong
1403085 weve been made aware of the fire through our shared emergency planning unit in suffolk suffolk homes

1403163 we have a passion for design in transportation which goes back for 20 years and that is fundamental to this car it looks fantastic but there is function there too great aerodynamics and low weight combine to maximise performance and handling and the low nose and high wings which enclose the wheels allow the driver to place the car very precisely on the road or track

1403191 were going back almost 10 million years before any previously described asian anthropoid
1403192 the new fossils from india are exciting because they show that the anthropoid lineage is much more ancient than we realized
1403193 most of the fossil record of ancient primates is made up of teeth because teeth are easy to preserve and hard
1403194 occasionally we get lucky enough to have a skull to work with but in this case a few teeth is all we have
1403195 from the tooth size and structure we can say something about the animals body weight and diet because teeth have crests that are differentially developed depending on whether they ate primarily insects leaves or fruit
1403196 aig rises as ubs upgrades to buy on narrower losses
1403197 its hard to tell parents how to interact with their children based on one study but what we see here is that parents who have a propensity for being verbally aggressive have a tendency to try to direct and control their children during a play period
1403198 as a result these children were less cooperative and not only are parents setting up situations that are challenging for them to handle but they also are subtly undermining their childs self esteem
1403199 of course all parents direct their children and people in general are always directing others to close a door or hand them something
1403200 its something we do all the time but there is a qualitative difference in the kinds of directing going on by these verbally aggressive mothers by looking at how and when directives occurred not just how often we found that moms who scored highest on verbal aggression used directives to control the child and ultimately the way the game or activity was played the aggressive action is not overt as in a parent hitting or yelling but these small negative maneuvers can say so much to a child
1403201 we all say things to our children that we regret saying but saying a lot of things that attack a childs self confidence is not healthy
1403202 these parents were in an unstructured low stress environment and if we saw this behavior in such a brief setting how could such negative interactions even so subtle affect a child over the long term for example if the parents always have to control what activity they and their children are going to play as well as for how long and how they are going to play it you wonder if this communicates to the child that what they want to do doesnt matter
1403203 based on the existing body of evidence and our experience implementing male circumcision to strengthen our prevention efforts we are asking the international community to help national governments and their partners to introduce male circumcision wherever hiv prevalence is greatest and circumcision rates are lowest in the nations of eastern and southern africa
1403204 as news gets out about the efficacy of male circumcision we need to meet that demand with quality services and a comprehensive hiv prevention approach and scale up male circumcision as an ethical human rights issue
1403205 we seem to forget that we have an intervention that is 60 to 70 percent effective for preventing hiv in men more effective than any vaccine currently under development
1403206 but the word is getting out just by word of mouth the demand is so great that already men are going to unqualified practitioners and experiencing serious complications we must scale up our response rapidly to meet the demand for safe circumcision services
1403207 specific cells in the foreskin are favored targets for hiv infection
1403208 also the inside of the foreskin lacks the tough covering that protects most skin from infection
1403209 circumcision status was not associated with any sexual dysfunction or with specific sexual dysfunctions premature ejaculation pain during intercourse erectile dysfunction at follow up visits
1403210 the results of this study suggest that hiv risk behaviors are unlikely to increase they may even decline as we saw in our study
1403211 we were struck by this monumental research that shows circumcision having the greatest efficacy in curbing the spread of heterosexual transmission of hiv to date greater than any vaccine in the pipeline today
1403212 free in both mind and body of concerns over hiv
1403213 was how many men seek out the service without our doing any marketing at all of the male circumcision program leading to the concern that awareness of the impact on transmission without access to services may lead to unsafe practices
1403214 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1403215 at these high injected doses we hoped to see drug like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment
1403216 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1403217 clinical and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the past 12 years showed that oral ascorbate levels in plasma and tissue are tightly controlled in the case series ascorbate was given orally and intravenously but in the trials ascorbate was just given orally it was not realized at the time that only injected ascorbate might deliver the concentrations needed to see an anti tumor effect
1403218 nihs unique translational environment where researchers can pursue intellectual high risk out of the box thinking with high potential payoff enabled us to pursue this work
1403219 is there really any other woman in the world who is so well known
1403220 oh well okay yeah she is smokin but i thought you were saying she had killed someone
1403221 but princess diana is probably the most popular woman in the world well if she was alive you know she was killed
1403222 our leaders in washington have been unwilling or unable to do anything about
1403223 i agree with the presidents decision to release oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to help replenish supply shortages resulting from hurricane katrina
1403224 catastrophic events like hurricane katrina are the reason the strategic petroleum reserve was created and releasing oil at this time is appropriate but to truly provide americans relief from skyrocketing oil prices we must get serious about decreasing americas dangerous dependence on foreign oil by increasing fuel efficiency and investing more in the renewable fuels that can lead us down the path to energy independence

1403308 weve had enough of inspections and all sorts of raids at the instigation of commercial entities in general both our law enforcement agencies and state institutions should stop terrifying businesses
1403309 i think medvedev is trying to weaken the people who dont suit him in putins circle
1403310 there is a disagreement about how relations should be with business and how to conduct foreign policy this division exists and the question now is whether it can be managed or whether it will grow
1403311 this is the first time that the president has strongly and clearly opposed putins line
1403312 what medvedev said is correct from the perspective of economics on the other hand the business elite doesnt really believe that he is the full fledged president but this is a first step that shows that he is becoming president and that is good
1403313 in the eyes of the public putin is being active strict masculine tough and decisive most voters like this after all who likes the rich they like to see another fat cat put in his place
1403314 the fact that this harms the stock markets causes the oil companies to lose money and harms investment projects in our country doesnt occur to them
1403315 putin is openly and publicly declaring that he is the main figure on the political map and its clear that medvedev still lacks either the resources courage or political experience to answer him forcefully
1403316 putin is now attacking but medvedev is not simply stepping quietly aside he feels the obligation to resist but softly he is not doing this directly but more like acting like a servant in a play by moliere or shakespeare who is whispering an aside while his master is speaking
1403317 i think in the short term they will manage and regulate this disagreement and move it to the back burner but i think in the long term this disagreement can only grow
1403318 there are two ways this could turn out either there will be a big fight one of the two will win and we will return to having a single administrative center or they will find a compromise that says vladimir vladimirovich putin this is your area this is dmitry anatolyevichs medvedev

1403340 this is how you tell a story that is how you dont
1403341 yet despite the traditional prominence of psychotherapy in psychiatric practice and training there are indications of a recent decline in the provision of psychotherapy by u s psychiatrists a trend attributed to reimbursement policies favoring brief medication management visits rather than psychotherapy and the introduction of newer psychotropic medications with fewer adverse effects
1403342 this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement increases in managed care and growth in the prescription of medications
1403343 psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients had fewer managed care visits and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often
1403344 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
1403345 a key challenge facing the future generation of psychiatrists will likely involve maintaining their professional role as integrators of the biological and psychosocial perspectives while working within the constraints of the strong market forces of third party payers and managed care to implement advances in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders
1403346 our long term goal should be to alter our lifestyle accordingly beginning in infancy or early childhood
1403347 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy 7 months is perfectly safe without adverse effects
1403348 our review of the literature convinces us that more aggressive and earlier intervention will probably prevent considerably more than 30 of coronary heart disease
1403349 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30 why not nip things in the bud
1403350 the weapons for those wars education and behavior modification are the same as those needed for a war on coronary heart disease
1403351 a concerted national effort might dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality due to three major chronic diseases it would take generations to achieve and it would require an all out commitment of money and manpower to reeducate and modify the behavior of a nation
1403352 epidemiologic observations of sex differences in the onset and course of schizophrenia prompted exploration of estrogens role in schizophrenia
1403353 estrogens neuroprotective and psychoprotective actions may be mediated by a variety of routes ranging from rapid actions including antioxidant effects and enhancement of cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose utilization to slower genomic mechanisms which may include permanent modification of neural circuits
1403354 the lack of effect for negative symptoms is consistent with literature reporting that negative symptoms are less responsive to treatment than other symptoms of schizophrenia it is possible that longer term treatment is required for negative symptoms to respond to treatment alternatively brain regions implicated in negative symptoms may be less responsive to gonadal hormone effects
1403355 estrogen treatment is a promising new area for future treatment of schizophrenia and potentially for other severe mental illnesses
1403356 were small and were best explained by common genetic factors with opposite effects on exercise behavior and symptoms of anxiety and depression
1403357 in genetically identical twin pairs the twin who exercised more did not display fewer anxious and depressive symptoms than the co twin who exercised less
1403358 it is unknown which genes might be involved in voluntary exercise behavior and in the risk for anxiety and depression
1403359 only voluntary leisure time exercise is influenced by genetic factors whereas the other type of exercise directed and monitored by someone else is environment driven the absence of causal effects of voluntary exercise on symptoms of anxiety and depression does not imply that manipulation of exercise cannot be used to change such symptoms
1403360 the antidepressant effects of exercise may only occur if the exercise is monitored and part of a therapeutic program

1403369 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1403370 thats kind of a tricky question ive got colleagues in the senate who are doing absolutely outstanding work and theyre well into their 70s
1403371 nobody is term limiting the lobbyists or the slick operators walking around the halls of congress i believe in one form of term limits theyre called elections
1403372 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened a lot of jobs have been created
1403373 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago

1403377 for decades the medial temporal lobe structures have been linked to both memory and spatial cognition
1403378 so we set out to test how these two abilities related to one another and to the temporal lobe area of the brain
1403379 we concluded that the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are not essential for path integration since we showed that the tests could be successfully accomplished despite damage to these brain regions
1403380 this is not a novel to be tossed lightly aside it should be thrown with great force
1403381 at a time when life saving medications are available to treat persons living with hiv there continues to be a population of hiv positive people who have fallen through the cracks
1403382 frequently their only contact with the healthcare system is during a hospitalization
1403383 we know that not being engaged in care and prevention services is not only bad for the individuals but is also bad for society in that a substantial fraction of hiv infected crack users engage in behavior that transmits the virus to others
1403384 hospitals like grady and jackson are doing the best they can in the face of a persistent problem with limited resources
1403385 more needs to be done to address substance abuse and mental health in this population
1403386 the molecular interaction in oxygen revealed by this study is due to the unique fact that oxygens outmost orbital is half filled with two unpaired electrons
1403387 as the molecules are squeezed into smaller volumes at high pressure electrons in the orbital inevitably move about trying to pair with electrons in the neighboring molecules
1403388 the behavior of oxygen at high pressure demonstrates one of the most profound effects of pressure on matter which transforms the colorless air we breath into colorful dense solids
1403389 the drastic change in the appearance of this familiar gas is due to the bonding changes in oxygen induced by high pressure
1403390 this is the first demonstration of how new tools can be used to probe the subtle interactions between atoms and molecules that lead to the formation of entirely new crystal structures
1403391 these new structures may give rise to entirely new electronic magnetic and other physical properties that could lead to new technologies
1403392 it is exciting to find that oxygen forms molecular clusters under high pressure through similar mechanism and this opens a possibility for new forms of materials at high pressure with potential for technical applications
1403393 theres a tradition in archaeology of saying people dont move very much they just transfer ideas through space
1403394 we know that humans had to migrate at some point in their history but we also know humans tend to stay put once they get someplace
1403395 all of a sudden with genetics you can actually address that question
1403396 africa has the most genetic diversity in the world but it is one of the least studied places
1403397 ive always felt like there were a lot of stories there that nobodys had the time or interest to look into
1403398 the family tree of the y chromosome is very very clear
1403399 i like the fact that the linguistic genetic and archaeological evidence all line up
1403400 when you see lines of evidence converge on a single model it means thats probably something that actually happened
1403401 so rarely do we get to pin down the questions raised by archaeology

1403405 its a tough state to move but were making a play
1403406 if theres any year where a democrat can win alaska this is the year
1403407 theres a sense of betrayal with mccain in the fact that he doesnt support it
1403408 theres the sense that hes not any better than a democrat
1403409 i think obamas message is similar to sarahs two years ago
1403410 people want to believe that these really complex public policy questions are going to be solved by what i call glittering generalities
1403411 weve always voted up here just nobodys paid much attention
1403412 i think what surprises me is the animosity or the rudeness if theyre republican they say im not even going to talk to you or they hang up
1403413 they really appreciate that people would come to your town and talk to you thats a big thing

1403440 if you heat metal up the heat encourages the corrosion on the bullet
1403441 the same could be said for bombs wherever they may be from
1403442 we have been contacted by the us military as to its potential to find fingerprints on fragments of explosive devices
1403443 you could have a fingerprint put on metal of a bomb that goes off
1403444 the heat is generated that can enhance the corrosion of the metal
1403445 we have discussed using this technique on recovered fragments of bombs then finding prints of people who have handled the device before its manufactured
1403446 in our opinion the science could work just as well on fragments of a bomb as it does on bullets
1403447 no matter how good the microbial forensics may be they can only at best link the anthrax to a particular strain and lab they cannot link it to any individual
1403448 typically i think the liberals pursued what some people have called an ethnic brokerage model of outreach where they would identify leaders of certain groups who somehow magically would become the recipients of substantial grants and subsidies for their community organizations
1403449 until now there really has been no web site highlighting all the many contributions made by canadians of arab origin to our society
1403450 this project will help web users from canada and abroad to better understand this vast community
1403451 this web site will be a valuable networking tool for members of the arab canadian community
1403452 the internet enables us to engage in dialogue with people of all backgrounds and all cultures
1403453 if we wish to build a truly diverse society in which all communities are represented we must invest in web sites like this one

1403458 they chinese sports federations have high expectations for us to create the best products to allow their athletes in each sport to perform and compete for medals
1403459 they challenged us to create the best and that allows us to really rise to our full potential
1403460 it always starts with the athletes who are often the new sources of innovation
1403461 we take whatever we know and combine with what we dont know its always fun to do
1403462 in the beginning i mistakenly considered it a jogging shoe because it was so light
1403463 there are so many parts of wushu you really have to get into the culture and know about it in order to make a proper shoe
1403464 the mix of competition and consumer products is some of the best weve ever done
1403465 its always our challenge to work with the athletes to elevate their performance and help them realize their potential
1403466 the best gift that i ever gave myself is my life coach
1403467 this is the best personal growth work that i have ever done
1403468 i feel the coaching process has really helped me to see the world and my life through different glasses and challenged me to really get to know myself accept myself and take responsibility for my life

1403473 lullabies are traditionally very simple and beautiful melodies that are small yet powerful in their emotional content
1403474 in every culture they are the same we started by choosing lullaby worthy material and then did modern classical treatments of them which for us meant creating something edgy but at the same time minimalistic since lullabies should always be simple

1403490 we are extremely excited to support canadian talent this year at irie jamboree 2008 i am confident we have found the best canada has to offer
1403491 tanyas forthcoming album music is my life supports her talents and confirms her position as the top female reggae artist in canada
1403492 while we seek to expand our marketing efforts internationally our expectation is to bring awareness to the irie jamboree product to foster long term relationships with our neighbors in canada and encourage patronage at irie jamboree 2008
1403493 the reason the joker worked is because hes insane and batman is also crazy you need someone who is more than evil anyone who saw tommy lee jones as the cackling lunatic knows that
1403494 ideally you want another movie with heath without him catwoman but really think that one through give her a new take
1403495 catwoman needs to be part of it thats even more obvious now that hes living on the other side of life
1403496 it would be fun to see them put a spin on a less obvious one like they did with ras al ghul
1403497 catwoman s such a powerful and sexual and strong woman and i like that but god i hope not as frank millers version of her as a prostitute thats the worst part of year one thats just frank trying to be outrageous it didnt ring remotely true to me
1403498 id like to see catwoman over the penguin not as a prostitute and not as the tim burton version what cats sniffed her back to life but perhaps the adam hughes design with the goggles thats very realistic i can imagine her in street clothes that are designed just right i also like the idea of them creating villains just for the movies
1403499 theres a great story to be told of the triangle between bruce batman and selena catwoman i love writing her she plays with him like a ball of yarn shes the only one that makes him all rigid when he talks to her
1403500 i would pick the calendar man julian gregory day long halloween and dark victory happen to be my favorite collections hes not an iconic character but he means a lot to me im called the calender man on the coheed and cambria tour bus because im always on time but hes more like a hannibal lector figure
1403501 at one point batman had a therapist hugo strange who was actually a great villain
1403502 when hugo strange found out about batmans identity through analysis he drugs him and takes over his identity
1403503 unless maybe he just has a skin condition it would be weird though riddler could work as well
1403504 characters like catwoman riddler and hugo strange make sense because theyre counterpoints to batmans psychosis and fears the joker creates chaos two face shows the duality of the batman bruce wayne relationship and how batmans found peace with that duality batman searches for answers and the riddler has questions batman is driven and catwoman is sexual they play well against each other and challenge aspects of what makes a hero

1403516 mental illness is responsible for 13 3 per cent of the total burden of disease in australia and so is clearly one of the most significant conditions for the nation
1403517 the strength of our results did surprise us though i think it shows that the childrens television standards should be updated to take that strength of community views into account
1403518 parents really feel strongly about their children seeing so much junk food advertising so they are really supportive of the government doing more in this area

1403536 we didnt make our outside shots tonight as well as weve been in the past but at the end of the day we won the ballgame we found a way to win
1403537 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ballgame
1403538 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1403539 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass

1403557 worthiness in very simple terms means i have found a way to let the energy reach me the energy that is natural reach me worthiness or unworthiness is something that is pronounced upon you by you you are the only one that can deem yourself worthy or unworthy you are the only one who can love yourself into a state of allowing or hate yourself in a state of disallowing there is not something wrong with you nor is there something wrong with one who is not loving you you are all just in the moment practicing the art of not allowing or the art of resisting

1403620 this kind of remark has no place in any setting and martin knows that and is truly sorry for his serious error in judgment
1403621 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1403622 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues
1403623 ucla should have detected the violations by ms jackson years ago and should have immediately initiated the process to dismiss her
1403624 i was trained almost 30 years ago and received a lot of training in psychotherapy
1403625 thanks to the advances of managed care psychotherapy was basically devalued from the perspective of psychiatry all that we were supposed to do was diagnose and consult for pharmacotherapy a lot of the incentives for wanting to be in psychiatry were essentially removed by managed care
1403626 they tend to rely more heavily on self paying patients
1403627 whats happened anecdotally is that some of the residents that i trained with have basically dropped out of insurance plans and are taking cash only business where they can provide the comprehensive services including psychotherapy
1403628 its a clientele thats at a much higher economic level if theyre socially inclined they end up volunteering at community mental health centers
1403629 we know that for depression the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy leads to better outcomes
1403630 unlike past batman films where the villains were somewhat surreal and comical figures heath ledgers joker is a brilliantly acted but very credible psychopathic killer who extols the use of knives to kill and disfigure his victims during a reign of urban terrorism laced with torture

1403639 glad to hear something a little more than deafening silence from the top on the way this introduction was mismanaged
1403640 i lost 2 weeks worth of emails and they didnt give me their os is flipping amazing but their customer service runs like windows vista

1403655 i cannot tell a lie father you know i cannot tell a lie i did cut it with my little hatchet
1403656 my son that you should not be afraid to tell the truth is more to me than a thousand trees yes though they were blossomed with silver and had leaves of the purest gold
1403657 i cannot tell a lie father you know i cannot tell a lie this beer is just ok when served from a bottle
1403658 it bag is not just a tote after all it also bestows status and has myriad freudian connotations symbol of the womb perhaps a reflection of the wearers personality
1403659 you can interpret it different ways said douglas who also made two valise type bags based on the shape of fish ovaries and embroidered with red stitches to conjure blood vessels
1403660 bags are so identified with women said museum director suzanne chabot
1403661 would you agree to open your bag to just anybody
1403662 beading an ovary you finish that and you feel like god youve just built this thing cell by cell douglas said in the garden of her home explaining that she learned to sew as a child but does not find the time to sew lost buttons and other sundry damage on the clothes of her three children
1403663 a stand in for the wear and tear after years of taking care of the baby she said

1403667 its not about spending 40 for 4 hours of little beers its more about the experience
1403668 added everyone up and divided by how ever many folks were there
1403669 hey have you tried this beer yet you gotta try it its perfect
1403670 we only have 4 hours we need to try everything and fast
1403671 how do you like working the fest is it something youd do again or recommend to others
1403672 ive decided to to jump head first into a sam adams summer style case and review it from bottle to bottle in honor of the summer season as well as our nations revolutionary history
1403673 at around this time adams had spent and mismanaged most of his inheritance to the point where creditors even attempted to seize his home by 1760 adams was bankrupt
1403674 in west african folk medicine grains of paradise are valued for their warming and digestive properties a melegueta has been introduced to the caribbean islands where it is used as medicine and for religious voodoo rites
1403675 between mmos designed in the west and those designed in the east
1403676 from my standpoint i thought they were ok it was fun just competing out there but i thought the corners were going to be a little more physical but they didnt really play me up close
1403677 i dont know if anyones going to beat this one the weight room the facilities the head coach were all impressive
1403678 this was the first time the head coach came downstairs from his office to just see me usually i have to go up there to see him its great nothing gets better than this i might as well go on and commit
1403679 im just going to see what else is out there because i dont want to rush the process
1403680 i know some people commit and then de commit and that makes them look bad im going to take my time and look at all my options
1403681 driving onto the common or a footpath is illegal and we are now assured that the increased police presence and the covert cctv we have in place will catch more offenders
1403682 the clear message needs to go out if you drive or ride on bucklebury common you will get caught
1403683 sa se poarte frumos si sa nu se faca de rusine

1403685 the letter handed over is not an answer to the offered package the letter does not mention the freeze for freeze issue
1403686 if we dont receive a clear message from them we will have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1403687 during the call jalili expressed his readiness to start formal talks
1403688 there was a slight safety risk for women wearing normal bras with metal parts underneath a bullet proof vest

1403690 beginning this fall our passengers will have the ability to stay connected when they travel with us throughout the continental united states
1403691 everyone is used to seeing athletes in competition or winning but we wanted to give people the chance to see the real make up of an athlete and their muscle and power
1403692 definitely one of the more unusual shoots ive taken part in but also one of the most enjoyable
1403693 for the shower its high for sleeping its big everything is better organized this year
1403694 its an emergency light in case the electricity goes out
1403695 theres no reason it should we just want everything to be perfect
1403696 we are just out here enjoying it trying to feel that good breeze thats coming in
1403697 weve fared this pretty well thank god weve had a lot worse
1403698 it wouldnt be how we understand the operation functioning no doubt we can clear up the matter quickly
1403699 my face was pushed into the ground my arm was twisted and i was hit two or three times in the face
1403700 this is utterly unacceptable any time its particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics at a time when china has promised complete media freedom
1403701 the japanese reporters violated the rules of china by forcing their way into a military area the act was not well justified and they should accept the consequences
1403702 i however apologize to the reporters as the top regional public security official for the clash they had with the border policemen
1403703 the issue of screening for prostate cancer is frankly an area of medicine that remains somewhat unsettled
1403704 while its clear there is benefit to a significant number of men its equally clear that many men end up being diagnosed and treated for cancers that would likely not have caused them any significant harm
1403705 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1403706 thats because every 75 year old is not created equal
1403707 very active very vigorous and have minimal health issues and many of those men are going to live into their late 80s or 90s
1403708 i was watching television about 11 15 and i heard a car sliding on the highway out in front of our house as i looked out the window i saw it began to flip after it hit our next door neighbors drive
1403709 it went end over end about twice and then it came back on its wheels in the ditch it was a mess
1403710 mr freeman thought he may have gone to sleep but he wasnt sure
1403711 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely
1403712 it was so bad i couldnt tell what it was
1403713 was more concerned about the people around him than himself
1403714 developing an aids vaccine may take more time and innovation than we might have once imagined but we are confident that science will prevail the necessary direction for the field is clear
1403715 we have got to create this new mechanism to be able to turn the aids vaccine into a normal product development initiative so that every time there a failure it doesnt raise the question of whether this is the end of the line
1403716 strong scientific evidence in both humans and animal models suggests that developing an aids vaccine is possible
1403717 before vaccines go into efficacy trials they need to go through a set of screenings to look at evidence they are significantly better
1403718 we are pushing a whole new generation of vectors we have got candidates coming down the pipeline on that
1403719 i think what you have here is the gambino crime family reaching out to tampa fla
1403720 they tried very hard to convict him up here they spared no resources and it didnt work
1403721 its tragic for him and his family to have to continually go through this its almost laughable
1403722 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1403723 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1403724 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be
1403725 if he is i might go see him when im done here
1403726 while americans are hurting barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1403727 our economy is in turmoil i dont have to tell the people of youngstown
1403728 people here have known some hard knocks and hard times
1403729 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1403730 wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks
1403731 if we fail to act there are severe indications for national security our economy and our environment
1403732 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio worker makes in a year
1403733 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1403734 thats kind of a tricky question ive got colleagues in the senate who are doing absolutely outstanding work and theyre well into their 70s
1403735 nobody is term limiting the lobbyists or the slick operators walking around the halls of congress i believe in one form of term limits theyre called elections
1403736 the corporate spoofs that are so prevalent on the web today might be a fun way to experiment with media but for most companies especially in the b2b space the amateur video style offers very little for their brand

1403767 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
1403768 while we were watching he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stared at us and dropped the head right in front of us
1403769 there was no rage in him and he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
1403770 he was taunting police with the head in his hand out the window
1403771 at this time im not aware of what may have provoked this attack

1403819 this is something that is very true in my clinical experience the uninsured cant get in to see the doctor they miss medications their blood pressure is out of control and really you see devastating consequences
1403820 these people are going to end up with complications of their illnesses prematurely they will be disabled early they will probably die younger it is a major public health disaster longer term there will be expensive admissions to hospitals usually through the emergency department due to diabetes out of control and congestive heart failure because of hypertension
1403821 it is interesting that chronic conditions are more common among people with insurance than without but that isnt surprising either people with a chronic condition are likely to place a higher value on their coverage and work harder to get and keep it
1403822 come to me you who are weary i will give you rest
1403823 no i can still make it the waters not so deep that i cant wade through it
1403824 all around us we observe a pregnant creation the difficult times of pain throughout the world are simply birth pangs but its not only around us its within us the spirit of god is arousing within us these barren and sterile bodies of ours are yearning for full deliverance
1403825 do you think that anyone is going to be able to drive a wedge between us and gods love for us there is no way not trouble not hard times not hatred not hunger not threats not backstabbing not even the worst sin mentioned in scripture they kill us in cold blood because they hate you were sitting ducks they pick us off one by one but none of this even fazes us because god loves us it is true it is absolutely convincing that nothing nothing living or dead angelic or demonic today or tomorrow high or low thinkable or unthinkable nothing absolutely nothing can get between us and gods love for us because of the way that jesus our master has embraced us

1403828 god is the answer to our yearning he is waiting for you he will deliver you because he loves you and thats the way he is

1403840 it seems like exxon pretty much has this attitude of out waiting anything by running through the legal process
1403841 if their game plan is to pull another rabbit out of the hat
1403842 exxon does not agree that there is any sound basis to award plaintiffs what they seek approximately 488 million over and above the 507 5 million that this court determined was the legally proper amount to punish and deter
1403843 the award here should be limited to an amount equal to compensatory damages
1403844 a 1 1 ratio which is above the median award is a fair upper limit in such maritime cases

1403881 the impact of higher fuel prices on car sales in china will be temporary

1403884 the fpo has over the years been the lifeline of troops in the field area both during operations in not only handling personal communication but also extending financial services and insurance cover beside sds services

1403887 we are working very closely with india on the final draft which the us will present in nsg for getting clean exemptions
1403888 its very hard to extrapolate from this finding to comment on the benefits of red wine directly because red wine has many other compounds besides resveratrol including ethanol which have very active biological effects
1403889 and in this mouse study we have shown that this particular compound has very strong positive effects on preventing cardiovascular disease reducing heart inflammation keeping bone health in terms of structure and function and maintaining loco motor and balance activity so if these effects translate into humans it will have a very good impact on the standard of human health
1403890 but we cant have half of america going permanently on a diet
1403891 we just cant do it its not practical and its not going to happen
1403892 so im not surprised by the finding but by looking at specific outcomes in specific tissues this work is certainly more detailed and rigorous
1403893 and it further supports the hypothesis that this compound staves off the effects of aging
1403894 these guidelines will prevent a blurring of the lines between the role of military and humanitarian actors preventing humanitarian space from being squeezed further
1403895 recognizing the distinct role that we have to play will be a vital component of protecting our impartiality and opening up humanitarian space for us
1403896 we all wanted to make a dramatic statement that were with him every step of the way

1403899 this government is not for the common man but to serve the interests of one man

1403929 the hollerith office at ig farben in monowitz used the ibm machines as a system of computerization of civil and slave labor resources this gave farben the opportunity to identify people with certain skills primarily skills needed for the construction of certain buildings in monowitz
1403930 i know that trains were constantly going from krakow to auschwitz not only passenger trains but cargo trains as well
1403931 would probably require at least two high speed tabulators four sorters and perhaps 20 punchers
1403932 the whole thing would probably require 30 40 persons plus their german supervisors
1403933 this latest disclosure removes any pretext of deniability and completes the puzzle that has been put together about ibm in poland
1403934 ibm must confront this matter honestly if there is to be any closure
1403935 proves once more that ibms hollerith machines in occupied poland were functioning in the area of yet another concentration camp in this case auschwitz monowitz something completely unknown until now it is yet another significant revelation in what has become the undoubted fact of ibms involvement in poland now we need to compile more documents identifying the exact activity of this hollerith b ro in auschwitz monowitz
1403936 it would be great to have access to those documents
1403937 please remember i witnessed in 1944 when the war front came closer to poland that all the ibm machines in krakow were removed im sure the farben machines were being moved at the same time plus the germans were busy destroying all the records even still
1403938 what has been revealed thus far is a great achievement
1403939 we still need to find more similar identification cards and printouts and try to find just how extensive was the usage in the whole i g farben administration and employment of workers but no one among historians has had success in finding these documents
1403940 we now know these are not impersonal entities they are directed by people with names and faces
1403941 the news that ibm machines were at auschwitz is just the latest smoking gun for ibm to continue to stonewall and hinder access to its new york archives flies in the face of the focus on accountability in business ethics today since the united states was not technically at war with nazi germany in 1939 it may have been legal for ibm to do business with the third reich and its camps in poland but was it moral
1403942 i was just trying to determine if it was ibm equipment that helped select my father to be shipped to auschwitz and if the machines were used to schedule the trains to auschwitz
1403943 i contacted senior management all the way up to the president trying to get an answer
1403944 since then i have read the facts about ibm in poland about the railroad department at 22 pawia street in krakow and i read about the eyewitnesses now i feel that ibm owes me as an ibm employee an apology and that is all i am looking for
1403945 was basically telling me there would be no public or private apology but i am still waiting for that apology and debating what to do next

1403967 often when companies make products that are comfortable and easy to use by the public interesting applications on the medical side
1403968 anything like that would require approval from the which takes years
1403969 but the possibility is there if simply from a cost standpoint our product is in the hundreds whereas most eeg machines cost between 50 000 and 250 000
1403970 im not sure its at the point of being as precise as it would need to be
1403971 i dont see it being a mainstream device in this form that said its certainly beyond a gimmick game issues aside its uncanny
1403972 when the item on screen did what i thought it to do it was surreal
1403973 this is science fiction stuff emotiv has jumped the first hurdle in simply making the device now they have to make it work with most games if they do this could hit the jackpot
1403974 right now when you want your second life avatar to grin you type it which is completely unnatural

1403987 se guardate un vero lupo vedrete che ha la bocca in atteggiamento di sorriso ugualmente un lupetto deve sempre sorridere
1403988 le coccinelle sorridono sempre e se si trovano in difficolt nel dolore nei guai o in pericolo non piangono ma solo sorridono e tengono duro

1403991 la legge dei rovers la stessa degli scouts nella lettera e nello spirito ma deve essere considerata da un diverso punto di vista che quello delluomo in entrambi i casi il principio fondamentale della legge scout esclude risolutamente legoismo e spalanca la porta alla buona volont ed al servizio verso il prossimo
1403992 come rover dovrai ricordare che varcando le soglie delladolescenza verso la virilit avrai superato lo stadio in cui si impara ad osservare la legge scout ma che ormai dovrai applicarla praticamente usandola come guida alla tua condotta nella vita per di pi sei ora in situazione di responsabilit tale da dare lesempio agli altri esempio che potr condurre verso il bene e verso il male a quanto a fondo tu mantieni la promessa che hai fatto sul tuo onore come rover di offrire agli altri buona volont ed aiuto

1403997 il segreto di ogni sana educazione di far s che ogni allievo impari da s invece di istruirlo convogliando dentro di lui una serie di nozioni base ad un sistema stereotipato il metodo quello di condurre il ragazzo ad affrontare lobiettivo di fondo della sua formazione senza annoiarlo con troppi particolari
1403998 a tal fine il sistema migliore far s che i ragazzi imparino da soli dando loro attivit che li interessano anzich inculcar loro nozioni sotto forma arida e scheletrica istruzione dobbiamo ricordarci che la grande maggioranza dei ragazzi gi stanca per le ore passate in scuola o bottega e che quindi la nostra attivit deve essere sotto forma di ricreazione ed in quanto possibile allaperto questo lo scopo dei nostri distintivi e gradi delle nostre dimostrazioni e prove di classe

1404022 we have documented the timing and magnitude of the tremendous climate shift in antarctica
1404023 the transition marks a shift from warm temperate glaciers with patches of fringing forest to tundra to todays cold polar glacier set within a barren polar desert
1404024 theres a climate boundary and it is between those two dates

1404079 i told linda smith i wouldnt want to drive across a bridge built by an engineer who was one of a thousand students in a distance ed class
1404080 we recognized that for quality distance education there needed to be a course cap of no more than 25 students
1404081 this encourages interaction between the teachers and students which is very important
1404082 if i run an online course and only 15 students signed up i have 10 empty slots why not open the course to students in other schools
1404083 i said lets do this for the right reasons not to make money but to collaborate and dramatically expand the selection of high quality online courses we can offer students
1404084 in the old days a university had a teaching center for teachers who needed help with traditional classroom instruction with online education instructional designers help instructors navigate the new challenges inherent to distance education
1404085 so many distance education programs get started and they build in an expensive administration we want a program that is still sustainable 10 years after the grant runs out

1404106 dude why would you save cold coffee in a pitcher
1404107 i just pour it over the ice cubes and it pretty much sucks
1404108 given the magnitude of the damage we do expect this to be a multiday restoration effort
1404109 i think if and when we do wed probably announce it after the fact as opposed to making any big announcement
1404110 we both wear rings and im giddy when i see all the pictures of people so happy standing there confirming the love they wish they could have expressed for a long time
1404111 im a big proponent of monogamous relationships regardless of sexuality and im proud of how the nation is steering toward that
1404112 was tricky part of the coming out process is figuring out who you like and what that means and how to act on it
1404113 being an actor reduced my level of anonymity i couldnt just go to some bar and walk in and ask someone out on a date
1404114 if i had any regret it would be that strange lack of anonymity that created panic within myself that i would be found out
1404115 in testimony during a criminal probe a top aide to former gov eliot spitzer said the governor approved the decision to have aides submit written statements instead of personally testifying in the attorney generals initial investigation into a dirty tricks scandal

1404120 i wish he had a place where he could have went to be safe
1404121 maybe he would still be here today i hope that this goes through so the other mine families dont have to experience the loss that we have
1404122 its very difficult and anything you can do to prevent other families from going through this tragedy will be well worth your effort
1404123 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1404124 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s we should require that u s taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects
1404125 there is very much an interest in moving the financing from us to the iraqis in terms of the united states no longer being involved in the physical reconstruction business
1404126 our ability to segment the market and offer appropriate products is a particularly valuable way to retain budget sensitive customers during todays challenging economic conditions
1404127 positive trends to look for including the fact that our non paid disconnects have sequentially declined in the last two quarters
1404128 all indications are that dsl will experience is worst quarter on record
1404129 cable operators appear to be weathering the crisis in much better shape
1404130 although cable modem net additions are down from previous quarters their decline is far less dramatic than that experienced by dsl operators
1404131 it wouldnt be how we understand the operation functioning no doubt we can clear up the matter quickly
1404132 my face was pushed into the ground my arm was twisted and i was hit two or three times in the face
1404133 this is utterly unacceptable any time its particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics at a time when china has promised complete media freedom
1404134 my whole goal for him was hes got to show me golf is the most important thing in his life
1404135 and the most important thing in his life is getting drunk
1404136 i had rib surgery two months ago i just had a cyst in my right hand and they finally got that out now ive got tendinitis in my left elbow
1404137 ive got healthy skepticism its good to be the skeptic the bottom line is we want to see this perpetrator brought to justice
1404138 a fingerprint connected him to a license application and an alias on the application connected him to a murder in california
1404139 one of the most rewarding moments in my police career
1404140 we understand his boat has been down there at least two years and he had been traveling in the area for some time over the last year

1404147 weak real estate and wood products markets remained a significant headwind although we are encouraged that wood products losses are slowly moderating
1404148 unprecedented conditions in the housing market are reflected in the second quarter results of our real estate wood products and timberlands businesses
1404149 there is no doubt that general muhammad suleiman is the closest person to bashar al assad and is his right hand in the armed forces and he knows everything
1404150 he has all the files security financial and army reform
1404151 its better to wait three or four days until the indications appear in this or that direction particularly because the assassination took place in a very precise way
1404152 as with everybody else it seems i cannot help but connect suleimans assassination to an ongoing attempt at eliminating people who have sensitive information on the lebanese file and syrias involvement there perhaps even the assassination of hariri et al
1404153 it seems that the indictment issued against president omar bashir of sudan by the international criminal court for genocide crimes against humanity and murder might have had a psychological impact here after all the tribunal is still the main threat against the regime
1404154 its really all wild speculation there is a big propaganda machine that would use something like this to imply that the regime is falling apart i think there will be a lot of speculation about this and all of it will be uninformed or misleading
1404155 a sea of tranquility in the middle east fraught with extremism factionalism and al qaida type elements
1404156 this is a police state and security is above everything in this sense its not going good for the regime
1404157 was at the heart of the regime and israel is in negotiations with syria and this is not the time to do it
1404158 normally israel would exhaust all possibilities to damage the regime but not now
1404159 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1404160 to consult on the nuclear issue and the right of states to peaceful enrichment
1404161 exchange ideas aimed at clarifying irans commitment to all international agreements
1404162 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1404163 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1404164 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1404165 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1404166 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1404167 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1404168 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence
1404169 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1404170 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1404171 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1404172 i told him to brake and actually right when the bus was coming he turned his head and i couldnt do anything when i was about to see the crash i took off my seatbelt i didnt want anything to happen to me
1404173 i wanted to get out of the van i tried to open the door unfortunately i could not do it when the airbags popped i flew next to him where he was
1404174 it helps us put this behind us so i wont have to worry about coming up here and getting questions about it we can put it aside and move on with the season

1404206 the key thing to remember here is that this has been photoshopped this isnt created by the engine
1404207 though it looks really cool its almost impossible to do in a 3d engine because you cant have lighting that smart and run on systems that are reasonable if we could do that we probably would in a few of the dungeons

1404221 watching a stressful sports game involving the national team can more than double the risk of an acute cardiovascular event and the uaes poor cardiovascular record means spectators here can be even more at risk

1404225 sen john mccains presidential campaign is buying into nbc universals olympics coverage
1404226 the mccain campaign made a last minute 6 million ad buy which tops the 5 million sen barack obamas campaign announced last month it was buying during the olympic games which begin aug 8 the latest media outlays of both presidential campaigns are the first substantial buys of national network tv by any presidential candidate in 12 years
1404227 with the olympics sucking out news oxygen and with mccain equalling obamas olympic ad purchase it looks like we are going to have to wait for the vice presidential picks and the conventions to see a marked change in the campaign we might be on hold for two or three weeks given the current trends in the campaign that is not a good thing

1404270 team over self is why we won coughlin stated as a press conference inside the basketball arena at the university at albany where steady precipitation forced a scheduled introductory welcome to camp picnic to be moved indoors
1404271 i am sure at some point that was part of the discussion coughlin said
1404272 i think that attitude will permeate the position we find ourselves in this year he said
1404273 and i think that with the quality of the individuals we have the character of our team that they certainly are going to realize that the attitude about believing in one another about supporting one another about the idea of taking the names off the back of the jerseys that is what served us best last year
1404274 the best thing i can do is make the analogy between this year with jeremy and the loss of tiki barber last year offensive coordinator kevin gilbride said
1404275 a player in some cases can be at a place too long tight ends coach mike pope said
1404276 i think the circumstances that happened with the injuries and the things that went on in his mind having to sit and win the super bowl i don t think his worth in his own mind diminished but i think he realized as this organization realized and the fans realized organizations and teams can keep moving when individuals aren t there
1404277 you don t replace in my opinion a hall of famer with one guy defensive coordinator steve spagnuolo said
1404278 but you certainly can fill people in there if everybody picks up the slack you can get the same result

1404319 the realisation by both industry and government that australia could gain a larger share of the industrys global activity by better commercialising australian innovation and focusing on those parts of the value chain in which we have a competitive advantage
1404320 the questions were designed to ascertain members retirement readiness understanding of general financial matters sources of financial information for super and investment decision making and superannuation knowledge
1404321 we consider basic level financial literacy to comprise such aspects as understanding compounding interest differences between credit card and home loan interest rates and the need to diversify investments
1404322 we found that women younger members those with lower levels of education people who were renting or living with their parents and those with lower super account balances generally rated low on these basic measures
1404323 the study found a high proportion of respondents could not correctly identify the risks of these investments they were better at picking them by their returns
1404324 while we found a clear distinction on basic literacy between men and women at the higher level there was less differentiation between the two with either gender achieving relatively low scores
1404325 also those who rated their financial literacy higher tended to achieve lower scores on the objective tests for advanced investment literacy indicating there could be over confidence in skills on advanced investment matters
1404326 this difference could be attributed to the fact that the qsuper respondents are generally better educated and have higher incomes than respondents to the national anz survey
1404327 the qsuper members who responded to the survey also tended to be older and on higher salaries than the general qsuper population
1404328 members who use qsuper sources of information and those who sought advice from financial experts and read financial publications had higher levels of literacy on all measures
1404329 in contrast those who used product disclosure statements tended to be less financially literate in more advanced investment matters
1404330 further research will also be undertaken to assess changes in financial literacy over time
1404331 were looking at ways of improving grass box gum woodlands for biodiversity by setting up various manipulations and treatments in mulligans flat and goorooyarroo reserves
1404332 our treatments include adding dead wood using controlled burning and excluding kangaroos that are currently over abundant at the site and are having a major impact on the system
1404333 the act government is also going to build a feral proof fence around one half of the experiment to keep out foxes cats and dogs the idea being that we can look at the effects of all these treatments and the interactions between these treatments
1404334 the experiments are crucial because we really dont know how these treatments will work or interact
1404335 and our record of protecting grassy box woodlands isnt very good
1404336 so far conservation efforts have involved fencing out stock trying to stop people taking out dead wood usually as firewood and tree planting
1404337 one example of this is that were still witnessing the disappearance of species from box gum woodlands even those placed in a reserve mulligans flat for example was set aside as a reserve in 1995 at that time it had brown tree creepers a threatened woodland bird species several years after it was declared a reserve it lost its population of brown tree creepers theyve become locally extinct in that woodland and were seeing similar things happening in other reserves so threatening processes are not being reversed by creating reserves therefore theres a need for proactive conservation and what were trying to do is provide the evidence for how this might be best done in box gum woodlands
1404338 it probably hasnt been approached in such an intense way at one site ever before for example with the addition of dead wood weve added at least 2000 tonnes of timber which would make it one of the largest types of experiments like this at the very least in australia
1404339 and working closely with a government partner is another noteworthy aspect of this project
1404340 i mean we could just say fallen timber provides important refuge for small mammals so just add timber and not specify how much or in what distributions
1404341 in our experimental design were looking at different distributions clumping or dispersed patterns and mixtures of both and thats important because timber is expensive to move so you dont want to put on any more than you have to
1404342 i think thats a good illustration of why its important for science to be involved rather than simply saying lets add more timber what we hope to do is to inform that process of restoration and demonstrate the value of such a process
1404343 one of the unique things about this project are the linkages between ourselves the act government and other research institutions
1404344 the idea is not simply that we are the scientists and they are the government who are doing things for our experiment rather we own the experiment together and we work together to make it happen what we learn and achieve is shared it can take longer to set up such a process but i believe the benefits are also more long lived

1404450 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat

1404510 in a compassionate society people respect one another and take responsibility for the decisions they make in life my hope is to change the culture from one that has said if it feels good do it if youve got a problem blame somebody else to one in which every single american understands that he or she is responsible for the decisions that you make youre responsible for loving your children with all your heart and all your soul youre responsible for being involved with the quality of the education of your children youre responsible for making sure the community in which you live is safe youre responsible for loving your neighbor just like you would like to be loved yourself

1404553 one of the reasons why were at black hat is to hear feedback and make sure that these programs are as effective as we intend them to be
1404554 the overall theme of trustworthy computing is about continuing to evolve as the online threats continue to involve and the exploit index and mapp are examples of our evolution
1404555 we provide enterprise management for the complete infrastructure whether virtualized or non virtualized
1404556 rather than just using xenserver specific management tools at the hypervisor we manage physical hosts virtual guests and anything else thats hooked up to the environment including mainframes databases clouds and saas software as a service
1404557 are not as friendly for production infrastructures that have a high rate of change which you typically see in infrastructures with virtualization well managed in the ecosystem yet and hyperics all about managing that environment monitoring performance and resources and adjusting them automatically
1404558 for what they do theyre the first such product for citrix xenserver
1404559 servers have physically been designed to handle one environment and the i o that goes with it including interfaces to storage and the network they arent optimized to run multiple environments simultaneously so when you run lots of different environments on a single server you have the potential for them to conflict with one another as they try to get to storage and network resources and thats a real bottleneck
1404560 not really efficient enough so you need something like 3leaf
1404561 we drive mainframe class features into x86 class commodity servers
1404562 id think if you have mission critical applications youd want to recover them in a lot quicker than six hours
1404563 microsoft and vmware are battling over milliseconds in terms of virtualization for disaster recovery and business continuity
1404564 indonesia is a promising market thanks to its large population

1404566 being able to send ad requests to one or more ad networks or any sales force where they might get an ad filled has become a fairly easy thing to do on the traditional internet
1404567 with this new partitioning feature publishers will be able to make all ad requests from one location and get back responses to one location
1404568 compress the amount of time they spend accessing and consuming media
1404569 a consumer looking for news can in 10 minutes online capture what probably took 40 minutes to do with a traditional newspaper
1404570 i think what you will see is that the time spent with new media obviously is increasingly but the total time spent with media is not
1404571 for example time spent with pure play internet will surpass recorded music as the third most used medium after television and radio meanwhile time spent by institutions on select media such as professional information business to business magazines and outsourced corporate training will continue to rise climbing 4 2 percent in 2008 to 301 hours per employee as technological advances allow businesses to access information 24 7 as a result of the decline in consumer media usage overall time spent with media will grow only 0 2 percent in 2008 to 3 713 hours per person
1404572 it will change but its not happening yet as a result it will be 10 to 15 years before some of the problems of newspapers in the west are dealing with come to india currently theres a gold rush of sorts some will flame out in disaster and some will be successful
1404573 you could call 2008 a tipping point with consumers poised for the first time to spend more on media than advertisers will
1404574 ce num r i poate pune la ma in un dobitoc rom n c nd ajunge n america
1404575 we have a payroll system thats antiquated it cant pay minimum wage under the current system we either pay no wage or we pay the full wage and with the choices were not going to pay people no wages they work hard
1404576 todays strong performance is very much the result of weakening oil prices but should we be optimistic going forward
1404577 if the pessimism of late has been largely driven by the exponential growth in the oil price and oil continues to ease then that is a boost to a majority of companies operating which are threatened by persistently higher oil prices
1404578 if oil continues to weaken it is a bit of a stimulus for the economy it takes the heat off bad debt for the banks
1404579 you still have a caution among a majority of investors because the outlook remains very uncertain and we continue to look down the barrel of these kind of big problems of slowing growth and inflation

1404588 the cut is expected to save 610 million a year for medi cal the states second largest program covered by the general fund
1404589 we are of course fully aware of the possibility that people may fear that this temporary period of high inflation could in fact turn out to be persistent
1404590 present macro economic circumstances are as testing as anything weve seen since the mid to late 1980s
1404591 we may now be witnessing the death of inflation targeting
1404592 it is certainly going to take a significant amount of time to deal with the inflationary pressures in the australian economy that have been developing for a long period
1404593 we know we are more than just neurons firing or at least we think we are while the neurons are firing

1404621 this is utterly unacceptable any time its particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics at a time when china has promised complete media freedom
1404622 the japanese reporters violated the rules of china by forcing their way into a military area the act was not well justified and they should accept the consequences

1404632 because of the shortage of rain we have a big crop problem its not good
1404633 we have sold our livestock and fuel wood to buy maize for food this has been our worst year yet
1404634 eating seed is unacceptable but with no rain at all with a very long drought it has resulted in this
1404635 the situation is very precarious and very terrible we have nothing left to plant
1404636 when a farmer starts to eat seeds it means the end of life
1404637 if you are at the point where you have to eat them you are not continuing for the future it is a big decision for someone to make it is a desperate measure
1404638 if there is no rain the crops that we are looking at will dry out
1404639 the problems will kill and will have an effect on the life of this whole community and society it would be very devastating
1404640 we are starving and striving to live but we are not in good condition over 50 of people in the kebele are in a very dangerous condition seed is the critical core of life but households have eaten them for others they have dried up
1404641 there is no food for eating there is no help for people children are ill they are swollen and are very tiny and skinny in our eyes other people are at risk of malaria and other diseases most of the cattle are dead and the price of food has increased and is expected to increase
1404642 we are confident that governments will make the right decision and adopt a ban with no exceptions no loopholes and no delays this is what is needed to do justice to the victims of this weapon and to stop the maiming and killing of generations to come
1404643 i am from a rural village in rakai we did not have a class photo but you know we had a football team when i was 18 now there are only two of us left
1404644 well i had a teacher who gave me some information so i understood the risks one day i was helping my brother organise a village disco he was older than me and i saw what some of those boys got up to i realised that i had to be careful and protect myself i had to take responsibility
1404645 every year we gaze enviously at the lists of the richest people in world wondering what it would be like to have that sort of cash but where would you sit on one of those lists
1404646 sport has long displayed an inspiring ability to overcome national political ethnic and cultural differences it can be especially powerful in instilling in children and young people universal values such as respect and tolerance
1404647 we made our claims for work on 20 june last year and were given a job in a nearby village
1404648 then we made another claim for work and were on site for two days and they made us sign a blank piece of paper illiterate workers regularly sign and corrupt officials fill in a larger number of days than has been worked and pocket the money
1404649 so we applied for work for a third time and there was 57 of us who went to this site where they told us our jobs were stone breaking but we had no tools once more we had to return to the village
1404650 it didnt happen so we held a rally outside the block local government office and stayed there all day in the rain
1404651 then the senior one went home and then came back verbally promising us work but we said we wouldnt go until we had it in writing then he wrote down three offers of work
1404652 we have now had 80 to 90 days at 70 rupees a day which shows that we were right to fight
1404653 the people were losing the forest to the logging contractors the water to the mines as well as the land they were losing everything

1404655 its all about governance accountability and livelihoods there are laws and resources coming into the region a widow might be entitled to allowances of 2 000 to 3 000 rupees but they just dont get through it could be corruption inefficiency or excessive bureaucracy but they dont reach her we try to monitor the process encourage people to claim whats rightfully theirs
1404656 we are not anti industrialisation but how it is done i would ask whether its right to rip 20 of the ground up heedless of whether people are suffering

1404664 as well as having a good day and picking up a few bargains the group can feel satisfied that they have made a lasting difference to people living in extreme poverty id urge anyone who would like to organise a similar event to get in touch from pub quizzes and coffee mornings to
1404665 we use this water to wash clothes at the tap stands the queue is too long and who has the time to wait especially for water that we use to wash clothes the tap stand water flow is unreliable as well so i prefer to go where i know i can get water

1404667 there was this one time during the cultivation season my friends and i were in the farm harvesting and we saw these ripe guava fruit not too far away and decided to help ourselves to the fruit we noticed a lot of dead goats and sheep between our farm and guava tree but made nothing of it we suddenly heard horses galloping towards us and we dropped the fruit and ran as fast as we could back to the camp we were so afraid i have never gone back that way again
1404668 i enjoy eating asida it is the best food i enjoy eating it from time to time
1404669 i dont have the desire to play anymore my place is here in this shop by my father
1404670 as i was leaving my house on saturday morning midge ure was on the radio encouraging people to come along to the thames bank and take part in the rally organised in advance of the g8 summit in germany
1404671 i arrived at the appointed meeting place archbishops park in lambeth to find several ngo stalls and the concern group congregating under a tree
1404672 the common denominator was a desire to make a noise that would echo all over london
1404673 they came on horse back the janjaweed and took all we owned it is hard for me to forget the very long and difficult cultivation of my crops i had put all my sweat into them
1404674 to begin with we thought we would stay here in the camp for a short time but it is now three and a half years since the attack on our village and there is no solution we continue to live in this small space in the middle of the camp there appears to be no end to our problem

1404677 just back from the peru trek and have to say we had a wicked time
1404678 everyone in the group worked as a team always giving support and encouragement when their fellow trekker may have been feeling down or finding the day hard and when you consider that most people only met each other at the airport its such a pleasure to be part of
1404679 i have to say though even with all the team work in the world we still managed to lose the peru vs rest of the world football match i suppose the peru team did have a few advantages
1404680 that was all forgotten though on the final day of the trek when we walked on the inca trail and admired the view of machu picchu from the sun gate truly spectacular

1404708 blogs are a good way to make things happen indirectly
1404709 there were many reasons that contributed to my decision after i took my trip here it was nice because my primary coach had previous experience with co head coach kelly kremer when he was on the mens side with former gopher mike brown mike left school before my trip but i trusted my coachs judgment in coach kelly i came here when i found out what kind of guy coach kelly is and i personally think the entire coaching staff is world class with a world class facility i fell in love with the team and minnesota in general it reminds me of home and by the end of the day its the kind of place i can see myself living and swimming there for four years if i have to get up and swim in a pool for years id better like it and i actually loved it here i knew my first full day here this was it for me i called my family the next day after lunch and told them im coming here
1404710 this whole year has gone by so fast and at the same time has been a real growth process i was in a new environment as many of the incoming freshmen were id never trained yards so for me that was an entirely brand new experience i didnt know that much about time so that was new too id never trained the way that we train here and never been coached like they coach here i wanted that change which is why i looked at coming to the states for school in general i wanted to be in a more competitive atmosphere and train with high level athletes the first two or three months were the least enjoyable just because youre trying to get used to school swimming and our dry land programs but it was so much fun at the same time i think around our training trip was when i settled into the group and being a gopher by the time big tens rolled around the team had a goal to win its obviously what the team was working for and training for they were so much fun and it was just really fun to be a part of something like that everything here is so much more exciting and competitive than anything i did in canada my ncaa experience was different than anyone else on the team since i was focusing on olympic trials a week and a half later but it was still so exciting and a really good experience to have before trials since i had the chance to swim against the fastest swimmers in america its nice to experience that level of competition and it really helps you come together as a team
1404711 im so ecstatic to be representing not only my home country but also the university of minnesota when i swam at the trials i wore a minnesota tattoo on my cheek in honor of our team i couldnt be happier and its more then anyone can ask for
1404712 we go to singapore for the two week camp which starts july 21st
1404713 my goal heading in is to just take it one step at a time my first goal is to get a best time and i would really enjoy getting a second swim if thats all i accomplish then ill be happy beyond that i would really enjoy breaking the canadian record and beyond that i would love to even make a final if i can do that i would get put on a relay i love relays because its a different side of swimming to experience and its great to be a part of
1404714 just being part of a team in general in canada we only have club swimming and not high school teams for the most part its individual oriented here obviously everything is much more team oriented and it changed my perspective on what it is to be a part of a team and to be on a team in general i think i can contribute what ive learned is my team management i also have just grown as an individual athlete i think im more competitive and that fire will still burn inside when im at beijing
1404715 die wahren ursachen der rekordpreise f r nahrungsmittel werden vollkommen ausgeblendet
1404716 die aufstrebenden nationen wie china haben gerade erst damit begonnen immer mehr fleisch zu essen
1404717 wer sich vegetarisch ern hrt leistet einen kleinen beitrag gegen die sich anbahnenden hungerkatastrophen
1404718 f r wiederk uer wie zum beispiel mastrinder oder schafe f r die getreide nur eine erg nzung ihrer futterration darstellt macht eine vergleichbare darstellung keinen sinn hauptfutterquelle ist hier meist gr nland
1404719 zur produktion von fleisch wird in den usa vor allem mais gro fl chig angebaut in europa sind es gerste andere getreidearten und kartoffeln neuerdings vermehrt auch mais daneben werden immer mehr futtermittel wie zum beispiel soja aus der dritten welt importiert wo ihr anbau und export zwar devisen bringt diese landfl che aber der eigenen nahrungsmittelproduktion fehlt

1404724 we trace the links between the people who made used and taught others to make them

1404743 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
1404744 but i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian

1404763 weve started preparatory work for construction of the new bridge crossing waitepuke stream and drainage work is under way
1404764 weve had a number of fatal crashes on this stretch of highway and the rugby rd underpass project will make it a much safer and easier route
1404765 this project will make a tremendous difference to the safety of motorists its much more than the construction of a new underpass were essentially giving nearly four kilometres of highway a full safety makeover
1404766 unfortunately in practice it is different with several parties trying to exploit the system and excessive submissions being lodged
1404767 those submitters would have to live in the same district as the application and own land there additionally no organisations or incorporated societies were allowed to make submissions this new approach dramatically reduced the number of submissions
1404768 the environment court process could also be optimised by a more stringent definition of an expert witness and by re defining section 274 of the rma allowing in principle every submitter to join a party to the appeal and be represented including the right to call expert witnesses and present the case
1404769 weve got a ridiculous situation here this is land that was mined for ironsand to a depth of nine metres 30ft in 1973 and yet we were required to pay experts to say whether there are maori artefacts likely to be disturbed by the turbine foundations
1404770 this should be a very simple resource consent because the land has already had industry on it and its for wind energy which the government is encouraging
1404771 everyone must have a right to have their say but the way an organised group of people who dont even live locally can make mass submissions is wrong
1404772 id be horrified if the waverley farm was fast tracked because theres been too little consultation i dont think people had any idea how big the turbines were going to be
1404773 everyone stepped up their game i feel that it was good but a little disappointing last year we came seventh and we were hoping we would improve but it was still a great experience

1404775 lets face it many other countries would love to have growth in the high single digits yes stock markets have fallen so growth may slow down a bit because if people dont have confidence they stand back but india and china are economic powerhouses and that is not changing
1404776 what is happening in the developed world you may say it needed to happen a slowdown was necessary because poor quality of credit had spread through the market also read dsp merrill pegs indias fy09 growth at 7 6 oil at 3 month low may fall further analysts 1 trillion laundered every year in india report us economic downturn likely to hit india ratan tata in asia and india the quality of credit is better asia is far more conservative in giving and taking credit we see in india even more conservatism creeping in in consumer finance for instance we see the quality of credit in asia improving

1404861 education is the point at which we decide whether we love the world enough to assume responsibility for it and by the same token to save it from that ruin which except for renewal except for the coming of the new and the young would be inevitable
1404862 in its broadest sense learning can be defined as a process of progressive change from ignorance to knowledge from inability to competence and from indifference to understanding in much the same manner instruction or education can be defined as the means by which we systematize the situations conditions tasks materials and opportunities by which learners acquire new or different ways of thinking feeling and doing

1404882 the fed is really locked in right now they cant go forward or backward
1404883 the economy may already be in recession yet the monetary policy committee feels unable to act given that inflation is well above target and rising
1404884 we knew that we had to join a major organization to guarantee our future at the same time we had the desire to protect our family heritage only bmr le groupe could fulfill both needs
1404885 with concerns over slowing demand for energy still dominating investor sentiment
1404886 edouard is unlikely to do much damage to coastal area refineries
1404887 partly a sentiment index if things are not getting as bad at a slower rate it can feel like improvement
1404888 qualitatively it changes nothing about our assessment of the economy growth is at best weak and inflation pressures remain elevated
1404889 increases the likelihood that the eurozone economy contracted in the second quarter
1404890 consumers purchasing power is being squeezed markedly by elevated energy and food prices furthermore tight credit conditions higher interest rates and rising consumer concerns over both the economic outlook and their personal finances are all negatives for consumption
1404891 the latest index signalled a contraction of private sector output for the second month running
1404892 the rate of decline accelerating to the fastest since november 2001
1404893 the fall has left the annual rate at a record low of 3 1 percent clearly the slowdown underway in the eurozone economy is related to domestic spending and not just external demand
1404894 it looks as though consumer spending could have knocked around 0 3 percentage points off quarterly gdp growth with other components of growth also likely to have slowed there is a risk that gdp fell in the second quarter given that the surveys point to a fall in the third quarter too recession risks are mounting
1404895 forward looking indicators notably the accelerating rate of loss of new business and reduction in employment paint a bleak outlook for the rest of the quarter and raise the possibility that the eurozone will endure a technical recession
1404896 but with output price inflation picking up again it looks like the ecb will remain focused on upward inflation risks
1404897 the marked fall in retail sales in june and sharper contraction in service sector activity in july according to the purchasing managers survey add to the mounting evidence that the eurozone economic downturn is deepening
1404898 is for a significant slowdown but no recession or prolonged period of sluggish activity
1404899 a deceleration in the course of 2008 and a re acceleration toward trend during 2009
1404900 that we believe will benefit the stakeholders of both companies
1404901 to achieve a deeper and more robust integration between the wide ranging global assets of the music company and sonys products operating companies and affiliates
1404902 consistent with our new growth strategy and will enable us to focus on our defined growth areas
1404903 sony has been an excellent partner and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential
1404904 we look forward to witnessing sony music entertainments exciting future under sonys ownership
1404905 the management team at norampac has a solid track record when it comes to restructuring and we have every confidence that they will deliver on this important objective
1404906 however if improved results cannot be achieved rapidly through restructuring other strategic alternatives will be considered
1404907 in q2 aggressive cost cutting and restructuring measures throughout our business groups together with increased selling prices were not sufficient to offset the negative impact of sharply higher costs in all sectors and difficult market conditions in our boxboard operations
1404908 when riding a bike one of the most difficult things to do is to balance while trying to stay still
1404909 in a way that is what the market is trying to do so far this week waiting for the central bank announcements but trying to gauge how best to balance in the meantime
1404910 for now standing still may be enough to ensure that the dollar advances after all most other economies appear to be sliding backwards
1404911 supported by expectations that the fed statement could sound more hawkish
1404912 the ongoing contraction in the manufacturing sector is looking more ominous given the deteriorating situation in the eurozone the uks major export market
1404913 we have said we will put in up to 3 0 billion pounds
1404914 we have got to get state aid approval for that so we cant give a precise figure
1404915 the external environment has deteriorated and the consequences of this for northern rock are increased credit losses
1404916 following a review in july of the companys ongoing regulatory capital requirements hm treasury has committed to a significant strengthening of the companys capital base
1404917 while the losses reported today are likely to continue as the restructuring proceeds and as the credit environment remains difficult i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership
1404918 the governments decision to inject extra capital into northern rock means that uk taxpayers will become shareholders in a troubled mortgage lender during what looks set to be the severest downturn in the housing market for decades

1405170 our performance in mathematics and science subjects is dismal and we continue to be faced by inadequate infrastructure poor and inefficient administration in some provinces and disaffected and demotivated teachers
1405171 the curriculum changes have been a severely disruptive yet necessary process
1405172 all these challenges have an impact on our ability to ensure that learners emerge from our schools ready and able to grapple with university level study
1405173 the inadequate responsiveness of higher education adds to this mix of problems and results in the revolving door syndrome of access and failure that we find in all our universities
1405174 south africa should not repeat the history of other systems that have taken decades to overcome discrimination and disadvantage
1405175 these values are absent in many of our educational institutions
1405176 students and staff should know that when they enter our universities and schools they enter places where principles and values exist in mission statements and in practice and that authorities will act strongly if there is a breach
1405177 employers complain about the language competence of our graduates they also refer to poor work ethic and to the absence of analytical skills
1405178 all students should have a working knowledge of at least one of the indigenous languages of south africa
1405179 they should also learn one or more modern languages and get an introduction to african history and civilisation

1405189 why discriminate when you freely choose what to do with your body brazil has been known for its progressive social policies and liberal attitudes regarding sexuality but in cuba the governments announcement that free sex change operations would be available represents a radical shift

1405202 although qtww has made substantial progress in the quarter and seems to be firing on all cylinders there are many unknowns in the business model and this model still carries rather large execution risk the macroeconomic picture continues to be challenging and the company must efficiently navigate this while expanding its business at a hyper growth pace
1405203 given company guidance of a 15 increase in fiscal year revenue for 2009 as compared to fy08 we have lowered our overall revenue number for this year mildly we would like to point out however that we feel the company is being quite conservative as the progress it has made in the quarter is above our expectations
1405204 we find the story particularly compelling as quantum has made meaningful progress in the face of pretty sizable economic deterioration we continue to have building confidence in this management and their ability to execute and drive new contracts and business we reiterate our recommendation for accumulation of shares of qtww with a speculative buy rating
1405205 the thriving new england solar market is proving that california isnt the only state where it makes sense to go solar connecticut and the tri state area is poised to become one of the major adopters of solar power in the nation
1405206 connecticut like many areas around the country has been hit with skyrocketing energy costs at home and at the pump we look forward to helping homeowners go solar and bring down those costs with clean renewable solar power
1405207 with rate hikes announced by connecticuts two utilities early last month residents are opening their august bills to find yet again more money they have to spend on energy

1405223 were seeing and experiencing more situations whereby the afghans have taken the lead
1405224 theyre not completely independent but were getting closer every day
1405225 we went over to them and asked them about what was going on
1405226 we all know ncos are the backbone of any army
1405227 as we increase their capabilities you have to have the right noncommissioned officers leading those squads and platoons
1405228 weve worked very hard in our mission to bring up the capacity and the capability of the afghan army and the police
1405229 and weve done it with a lot of american blood
1405230 its absolutely absolutely a difficult fight theres no doubt about it
1405231 nothing that we do over here is easy but we do have momentum and i feel very optimistic about things in the future
1405232 the equipment will give the ana another significant improvement in their tactical capability and their ability to take the fight to the insurgency

1405235 the negotiating committee made the holiday a top priority in contract talks
1405236 and we were able to get management to commit to it
1405237 eid al fitr is one of eight paid holidays for all team members covered by the contract while labor day is not a paid holiday
1405238 this new contract is good because it allows me to work on the second shift and still pray when i need to

1405251 research has shown that those most marginalized by lack of access to transport in rural areas are women the elderly the mobility impaired and people on low income and young people
1405252 as you know the rural transport problem is caused by a number of factors of which the main ones are probably low rural population densities etc we have become very dependent on cars in rural ireland
1405253 research has shown that those most marginalized by lack of access to transport in rural areas are women the elderly the mobility impaired people on low income and young people
1405254 research has shown that the provision of accessible affordable and acceptable local transport can be a very important improvement in the quality of life for these people
1405255 for a substantial number of older people free travel is an irrelevancy

1405261 the recent killings of our youth will no longer be tolerated
1405262 the pistols had a land rover to ferry them around the site but johnny seemed to prefer our car
1405263 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1405264 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1405265 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1405266 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1405267 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1405268 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1405269 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence
1405270 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1405271 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1405272 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner

1405294 the people there do not recognize the borders they move in and out due to economic opportunities in sabah
1405295 this problem has a very long history and many observations have been made on illegal immigrants the people here know this crisis goes back to the 70s
1405296 i think the focus of those involved in illegal immigration during that time was to ensure there was a change in the demography of sabahs population
1405297 but of course today in the whole of sabah no matter what race or origin or religion the people are now worried over this perennial problem
1405298 the main problem is they do not have identification and without this they cannot go to school so many end up as child labour
1405299 there are drug lords here who smuggle syabu amphetamines and sell it in the city using their children most of them are armed so the locals stay away from these waters
1405300 they tap into our electricity and water supply their children are quick to learn the local language and mix soon it will be hard to tell them apart from a sabahan

1405318 our position is to try to talk to them thai troops and get them to withdraw to where they came from
1405319 over the weekend about 40 to 50 of them came and they were armed so the thai troops did not allow them in
1405320 it is commonly accepted that children who attend single sex schools lack appropriate social skills to deal with the opposite sex in later life
1405321 by using a whole pack of robotic dogs the aim is to create a much more frightening impression than was possible with the single dog of dog lab 01 which often inspired amusement something the artist did not intend lol the use of multiple robots also evokes contemporary anxieties about cloning the spread of new diseases and genocide the dramatic death of the robots challenges the utopian dreams of transhumanists in which robotic technology is seen as a means of overcoming our mortality as luciana parisi emphasizes the novelty of dolly the cloned sheep was not that you could clone an adult mammal but that our genes and organs can be designed and shaped the point is not solely that it is now possible to reproduce artificially but that human beings can be reproduced from scratch

1405327 its part of our election year coverage weve branded every tuesday as super tuesday with the prime focus of the day on politics
1405328 we do believe this was the last stronghold in gaza
1405329 when a man stands between two choices to be killed by his people or to be arrested by his enemy and he reaches a conclusion that it is better to be arrested by his enemy it shows you how cruel the situation is in gaza
1405330 the argument is made that there are just too many question marks about the future wouldnt it be better to wait until things clear up a bit face up to two unpleasant facts the future is never clear you pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus uncertainty actually is the friend of the buyer of long term values
1405331 which way the next 1 000 to 2 000 points in the market will go is anybodys guess but i believe strongly the next 10 000 20 000 and 40 000 points will be up
1405332 why doesnt obama have a clear lead in the polls
1405333 is probably this obama has been a sojourner obama lives apart he put one foot in the institutions he rose through on his journey but never fully engaged as a result voters have trouble placing him in his context understanding the roots and values in which he is ineluctably embedded
1405334 in many recent presidential elections americans have had a choice pick the candidate they think is a stronger leader or pick the candidate they believe is right on the issues

1405355 were used to the dea calling in help from various federal agencies and local law enforcement but i guess none of their usual buddies were available yesterday because from the picture below which appeared in the la times today it looks like they had to resort to calling in blackwater
1405356 are members of a disputed mercenary killer group now working with the dea a photo from the la times shows proof of one of two things either blackwater members are now working for the bush white houses drug enforcement agency or this semi illegitimate band of rogue federal cops have worse discipline than any of us ever imagined

1405363 when you are nervous about everything else you put your money in a toll road
1405364 thats the logic of infrastructure returns are stable and predictable you wont get fabulously rich but youll get stable cash flow
1405365 were just looking at ways to be more efficient and thats why i used the term public private partnerships trying to find some creative solutions
1405366 the reason im avoiding taxes is because i think taxes are addictive
1405367 economic conditions are tough and are going to be very harsh on the performance of state budgets in 2008 and 2009
1405368 states are looking for long term solutions in running businesses a public private partnership is a tool in their toolboxes
1405369 weve seen an unprecedented number of headhunters recruiting for positions on the buy and sell sides
1405370 were very committed to this space our business activity has increased dramatically even this year
1405371 the argument for a public private partnership is the private sector is a lot smarter about paying attention to costs and because it has skin in the game will be more attentive to maintaining an asset over its life
1405372 elected officials often shortchange funding of maintenance because they dont want to increase user fees or taxes to pay for it
1405373 their election cycle is four years they can pass it on to someone elses watch

1405377 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1405378 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1405379 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1405380 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1405381 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1405382 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1405383 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1405384 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1405385 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1405386 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1405387 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1405388 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1405389 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1405390 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1405391 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1405392 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line

1405395 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1405396 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1405397 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1405398 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue

1405470 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1405471 this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1405472 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1405473 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1405474 like george bush and dick cheney before him he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long

1405488 may no more regulate the presidents ability to detain and interrogate enemy combatants than it may regulate his ability to direct troop movements on the battlefield
1405489 i always thought that only the cia should do this but people at the white house and at dod felt differently

1405573 climate change is happening this is a fact base camp used to sit at 5 320 metres this year it was at 5 280 metres because the ice is melting from the top and side base camp is sinking each year for sherpas living on mount everest this is something they can see every day but they cant do anything about it on their own
1405574 the glaciers have receded a great deal since my fathers time there are many things he wouldnt recognise today the glacier on which base camp sits has melted to such a degree that it is now at a lower altitude i think the whole face of the mountains is changing

1405580 our defense was excellent but on offense we seemed a little bit out of synch
1405581 what im really pleased with is it didnt come easy offensively for us and it never had a negative impact on our defense and to me thats a really big thing
1405582 if we hold a team to between 60 and 70 points for the most part were going to win you know youre not going to have a game every night where offensively youre in tune but the one thing you can control is defense
1405583 defense is very important to this team because were not going to shoot the ball well every day and we cant let our offense dictate how the game is going to go
1405584 one of the things about this game is that we respect our opponent no matter who it is
1405585 we know that each time we take the floor we are trying to get better and we dont look to be knocked out we look to be aggressive and erase the stuff that has happened in the past
1405586 weve been looking forward to this for a while we are very excited about this opportunity
1405587 its the hard work we are on a road to redemption
1405588 the first time that the issue of interrogations comes up
1405589 the cia guys said were going to have some real difficulties getting actionable intelligence from detainees
1405590 he has been pretty damn good at accumulating power extraordinarily effective and adept at exercising power
1405591 humanely and to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity in a manner consistent with the principles of
1405592 the imposition of severe physical or mental pain or suffering
1405593 prohibits only the worst forms of cruel inhuman or degrading treatment
1405594 may no more regulate the presidents ability to detain and interrogate enemy combatants than it may regulate his ability to direct troop movements on the battlefield
1405595 i always thought that only the cia should do this but people at the white house and at dod felt differently
1405596 very angrily said there would be no more secret opinions on international and national security law
1405597 preliminary preparations for an insurgency are over we are going to launch it soon
1405598 but the government rather than taking it seriously has unleashed terror by arresting commoners and this has prompted us to wage an armed struggle
1405599 broke all the large and bulky party committees into a sophisticated one to make a unified force
1405600 the most important decision was to make party military oriented and military party oriented
1405601 we have a few old and homemade guns however our fighters are not trained for hi tech war we believe in getting trained in the course of war
1405602 there cannot be a better training field than the working area
1405603 we are very close for we follow the same ideology in the first place and they are also people of nepali origin in the second
1405604 we are helping them in guerrilla warfare strategy and working policy
1405605 it is likely that the unemployed bhutanese refugee youths in nepal will shortly become potential recruits for militant forces that currently destabilized northeast india southern bhutan and eastern nepal
1405606 frustration with a legal process between the governments of bhutan and nepal that appears to be going nowhere a splintered refugee leadership a seemingly uncompromising bhutanese monarchy and the lack of future options may push these refugee youth to turn to militancy
1405607 every person has a limit of tolerance if that limit is crossed one is compelled to resort to arms
1405608 we request all the political parties to form a unified front to fight against bhutans monarchy the common enemy of all democratic forces
1405609 the bhutanese movement will succeed only if it joins hands with dnc and bpp bhutan peoples party
1405610 its easy to start an armed struggle in bhutan because the government is very weak but it may have to face the military strength of india
1405611 arent the issues raised in terai and ours the same why does india keep mum over our issue
1405612 the organizations privy to our party had to lead the movement in mechi bridge due to the failure of the national front for democracy
1405613 the bhutanese people have marxism leninism maoism on their side
1405614 this is an analysis and decision which should probably be left in the hands of those undertaking the analysis and organizing in bhutan itself
1405615 what are the military capacities of the bhutanese state what are the factors favoring or working against an indian intervention what are the prospects for the cpb mlm to effectively arm itself what is the physical and political terrain of bhutan like
1405616 nearly 22 thousand security forces including the royal bhutan army royal bodyguard and royal bhutan police approximately 20 thousand indian army personnel are currently stationed in bhutan the soldiers are said to be kept in bhutan for military training road construction and other development works
1405617 we need to school ourselves on the social and political situation there using the scholarly journalistic etc materials available to us
1405618 we need to school ourselves on the social and political situation there using the scholarly journalistic etc materials available to us
1405619 it was aimed at destroying election related documents of the government there
1405620 weve launched a peoples war with a view to wiping out wangchuks monarchy system which is similar to hitlers and to rebuild a new bhutan
1405621 we are compelled to launch the armed struggle as the bhutanese government instead of fulfilling our valid 13 point demand has started creating terror with the power of the gun and staging a drama of parliamentary election
1405622 and im all for making revolution with real people though my money would be more on bill mauer and chris rock before kathy griffin but she does make me laugh
1405623 we deplore the contempt shown for international law in the construction of the wall encroaching on palestinian territory and making life utterly miserable for those forcibly separated by this illegal construction
1405624 the palestinian israeli conflict section of the mural is the only one that stands out as not being part of the experiences of american minorities in san francisco
1405625 believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernable reality
1405626 were an empire now and when we act we create reality and while you are studying that reality judiciously as you will well act again creating other new realities which you can study too and thats how things will sort out were historys actors and you all of you will be left to just study what we do
1405627 although the masses give rise to the ornament they are not involved in thinking it through
1405628 the role played by a passive or merely bit playing public must constantly diminish while that played by those who cannot be called actors but rather in a new sense of the term livers must steadily increase
1405629 these people seem relieved of activity and like men to whom something is being done its a pretty accurate description of the problem with most spectacle
1405630 to free socially conditioned phenomena from that stamp of familiarity which protects them against our grasp today
1405631 two things that are very simple to understand need to be said up front
1405632 could you point me to the clearest and most egregious instances of dishonesty on finkelsteins part
1405633 keep the c v change the subject and norman finkelstein has tenure
1405634 a land without a people for a people without a land
1405635 behind the actions of the dutch police is the arroyo government which since its ascendency has been in pursuit of joma sison and worked tirelessly to subdue his meaning to the people
1405636 it is in every interest of the us and arroyo governments to confine professor sison for his politics as the chief political consultant to the organization that comprises one half of the stalled ndf grp peace negotiations the arroyo government is declaring to the world it is not interested in resuming peace talks
1405637 behind the actions of the dutch police is the arroyo government which since its ascendency has been in pursuit of joma sison and worked tirelessly to subdue his meaning to the people
1405638 it is in every interest of the us and arroyo governments to confine professor sison for his politics as the chief political consultant to the organization that comprises one half of the stalled ndf grp peace negotiations the arroyo government is declaring to the world it is not interested in resuming peace talks
1405639 the revolutionary united front organization of the philippine people fighting for national independence and for the democratic rights of the people
1405640 the arrest of professor sison came after the philippine supreme court dismissed several politically motivated cases filed against him and several others the case filed against him by the dutch police is similarly politically motivated
1405641 the philippines dutch and u s are using judicial proceedings to put political pressure on the ndfp to surrender to the manila government
1405642 the people must continue to be vigilant and militant in defense of the rights of professor jose maria sison because the u s philippine and european authorities wish to keep him in their respective terrorist lists despite the fact that he has never committed any act of terrorism in the philippines or anywhere else in the world
1405643 chronology of the persecution of prof jose maria sison by the philippine u s and dutch governments
1405644 children in small scale mining sibutad zamboanga del norte philippines
1405645 as you know the united nations the european union and the philippines have all labeled the npa a terrorist group we work very hard to prevent terrorist groups from getting financing and all our citizens safe
1405646 in a statement posted at the website of the dutch justice ministry the court said that there are no sufficient indications that the accused sison while living in the netherlands committed the offenses he is charged with in deliberate and close cooperation with the perpetrators in the philippines
1405647 during my confinement i remembered those five years that i was placed in solitary confinement under military custody
1405648 when the napalm hit our village many people were still sleeping in their homes
1405649 those who survived the flames ran to the tidal flats we were trying to show the american pilots that we were civilians but they strafed us women and children
1405650 we should not ignore or conceal the deaths of unarmed civilians that resulted not from the mistakes of a few soldiers but from systematic aerial bombing and strafing
1405651 history teaches us that we need an alliance but that alliance should be based on humanitarian principles
1405652 we thank the american troops for saving our country from communism for the peace and prosperity we have today
1405653 does that mean we have to shut up about what happened to our families
1405654 the mission was to saturate the area so thoroughly with napalm that all installations on that area would be burned
1405655 but the flashes observed on the ground indicated the intensity of the fire to be accurate enough to destroy any about
1405656 methodical destruction of dwellings and other buildings forward of front lines which are or susceptible of being utilized by the enemy for shelter
1405657 methodical burning out poor farmers when no enemy is present is against the grain of us soldiers
1405658 when the napalm hit the entrance the blast and smoke knocked out kerosene and castor oil lamps we had in the cave
1405659 it was a pitch black chaos people shouting for each other stampeding choking some said we should crawl in deeper covering our faces with wet cloth some said we should rush out through the blaze those who were not burned to death suffocated
1405660 the americans pushed us back toward the enemy area and then bombed us
1405661 if you say these killings were not deliberate and were mistakes how can you explain the fact that there were so many of these incidents
1405662 we consider macarthur a hero to our country but no one can know the suffering our family endured
1405663 both governments emphasize the alliance but they never care about people like us who were sacrificed in the name of alliance
1405664 the most startling thing about these songs is that despite their anarchic jollity you could imagine any one of them played on radio 1 even in the daytime
1405665 the intergalactic applicants parallel universe pop stars with a fondness for fake blood and liver destroying quantities of booze
1405666 hoping to revive the popular sentiments of the time of the war with iraq but it seems to have had no luck in this regard
1405667 the communists should create a third pole by relying on their closest allied forces that will represent the interests of the majority of the people and work to build a pole that has influence and authority over a vast section of the people
1405668 our party as a communist party should play a key role in forming such a strong core
1405669 without forming such a level of unity with leftist forces
1405670 ultimately the third pole in our view and in fact is a new political power one opposed to the old system and its effort to renovate itself
1405671 they should distinguish between the different forces resisting the imperialists and take a position in a way that would help the forming of a revolutionary resistance not a reactionary resistance against the imperialists
1405672 rh are you saying that chiang kaishek and his kmt represented a break with imperialism
1405673 rj i think youre aiming your arrow at the wrong target here on the question of iran the main problem in the icm right now is not dogmatism but ultraleftism
1405674 the main danger is the error you are not guarding against
1405675 now as in maos day there is a principal contradiction and a need to build a united front accordingly
1405676 this is in contrast to the traditional trotskyist position now held by many claiming mlm that calls for fighting simultaneously on multiple fronts while calling for a third way
1405677 your position sounds to me like classic trotskyism classic trotskyism is wrong so you are wrong my position sounds to me like what mao said mao was right so i am likely to be right
1405678 fighting simultaneously on multiple fronts while calling for a third way
1405679 this is only giving a new twist to the old favourite ideological method also known as the a priori method which consists in ascertaining the properties of an object by logical deduction from the concept of the object instead of from the object itself first the concept of the object is fabricated from the object then the spit is turned round and the object is measured by its reflexion the concept the object is then to conform to the concept not the concept to the object the philosophy of reality therefore proves here again to be pure ideology the deduction of reality not from itself but from a concept
1405680 what mao said about his world is true about our world
1405681 preliminary draft of these on the national and colonial questions
1405682 the report of the commission on the national and colonial questions
1405683 why isnt the contradiction between imperialism globally and oppressed people globally
1405684 the contradiction between imperialism principally u s imperialism and the oppressed nations and peoples
1405685 it seems we all agree that whats most important is to uphold maos method
1405686 as the author of the rebuttal pointed out the cpi mlm considers the iri to be imperialist pawns and collaborators but yet it is this very imperialism now that wants to replace them
1405687 the contradiction logically of course if they were such pawns what is the need to replace them
1405688 they are the imperialists over there and those are their pawns over here
1405689 the relation between us imperialism and the iri is an antagonistic one between an imperialist power which wishes to build a hegemonic empire and a nation that wants sovereignty
1405690 whatever to the old truth countries want independence nations want liberation people want revolution
1405691 their capitalist class nature is to subordinate their nation to imperialism in fundamental ways while bartering for terms of exchange oil prices domestic cultural independence etc
1405692 nations have a right to self determination so when a government upholds national rights it has justice on its side
1405693 what is precisely a national bourgeoisie and a comprador bourgeoisie these are two lines and trends coming from the bourgeois class of semi colonial status one which bows down and operates with aggressive imperialist domination and undermining of national soveriegnty and self determination the other acts in the general interest of the class in in its general national character to act my point is fundamentally that what the state of iran at this current juncture represents the line of a national bourgeoisie and that the very contradictions that reveal itself in the iranian state which the cpi mlm was pointing to
1405694 national bourgeois state can become comprador and a comprador state can take on the line of the national bourgeoisie if we look throughout the semi colonial world this seems to be the case the kmt became comprador to us and german imperialism but line struggle was had and chiang kaishek was threaten with death and it became a political force of the chinese bourgeois resistance to japanese imperialism
1405695 when third world capitalists confront u s imperialism that makes them possible or necessary allies of the oppressed
1405696 yeah but the problem here is that this author is deceitfully trying to use maos line on national liberation to be applied to reactionary forces who are in fact not a break with imperialism like the islamic republic of iran and the pretending as if those who uphold maos line are somehow in contradiction with it
1405697 a country like venezuela is under immense pressure when it tries to build socialism because imperialism is so strong in the current era however because of resistance to imperialism from other countries it is able to begin to do that chavez was able to turn a country which had been completely tied to us oil into one that has become more and more independent
1405698 further let me ask what does the venezuelan state do about its petroleum industry
1405699 however i have yet to here from any maoists about what line should be taken
1405700 on what basis are you saying that venezuela is becoming more independent i believe that economic data shows them becoming more dependent in the current period that is trade between them and the u s has increased massively
1405701 they think that when capitalist resource producing countries including oil companies like iran libya and venezuela or sugar countries like cuba once was fight over the terms of sale of their commodity within the world market this is
1405702 i will say this much a revolutionary society will not have shopping malls with hooters restaurants in them as venezuela does
1405703 they think that these governments are objectively fighting the main enemy so that whatever their goals and motives they are objetively doing good even if they are opposing one imperialism with the backing and support of other major imperialisms
1405704 they think that when capitalist resource producing countries including oil companies like iran libya and venezuela or sugar countries like cuba once was fight over the terms of sale of their commodity within the world market this is independence and anti imperialist
1405705 and they think that the demands of capitalist governments are somehow national self determination as if those governments speak for either the will or the interests of their people
1405706 they equate national independence with national liberation or at least confuse the two and dont quite appreciate how only the revolutionary communist movement can lead national liberation in the world today and that even the rev com movement faces real unsolved problems in leading and consolidating national liberation
1405707 socialists must not only demand the unconditional and immediate liberation of the colonies without compensation and this demand in its political expression signifies nothing more nor less than the recognition of the right to self determination but must render determined support to the more revolutionary elements in the bourgeois democratic movements for national liberation in these countries and assist their rebellion and if need be their revolutionary war against the imperialist powers that oppress them
1405708 they think that these governments are objectively fighting the main enemy so that whatever their goals and motives they are objetively doing good even if they are opposing one imperialism with the backing and support of other major imperialisms
1405709 first i have to ask what is the importance of objective here rather than subjective this is not really clear to me
1405710 however i will state in such much as this reflects my views is that i do think there are states and political forces throughout the world who have anti imperialist politics without being mlmists the basis of that in my opinion is the subjective the political basis rather than something determined through economy like repeater is putting forward by speaking about venezuelan trade
1405711 in any case the aims of a resistance are decisive in determining its character the resistance of forces such as the taliban and supporters of saddam is a reactionary resistance chiang resistance against japan was based on the aims of us imperialists and his class interests of feudal compradors and not on the basis of the national and class interests of the chinese people
1405712 when dw says that the world today as in maos time has a principle contradiction this does not actually arise i believe from an analysis of the world of today
1405713 what mao said about his world is true about our world
1405714 it is important to dig into the line and policies of its promoters and the affects of the line and policies rather than just the class origins of the people that make up the leadership of the movements
1405715 emphasis added what is missed here is that in a number of cases fundamentalist movements are lead and based among petty bourgeoisie peasantry included
1405716 the essence of imperialist economism is the denial of the right to self determination
1405717 each time the driver steps on the accelerator a counter push back control mechanism is activated if the system detects excess pressure helping to inform the driver that they could be using more fuel than required
1405718 in this non exclusive club we are reading some hard books together while discussing and sharpening one another along the way
1405719 240 000 kindles have been shipped since november according to a source close to amazon with direct knowledge of the numbers doing a little back of the envelope math that brings total sales of the device so far to between 86 million and 96 million the price of the device was reduced to 360 from 400 last may then add the amounts spent on digital books newspapers and blogs purchased to read on the device and you get a business that has easily brought in above 100 million so far
1405720 completely dishonest and unprincipled attacks including crude distortions of our views aims and methods
1405721 silly sex and drugs groups that had their glory days in the 60s
1405722 the russian revolution was an incredible step forward for humanity but it emerged in conditions radically different from ours in the time since our methods of understanding the world have become more complex particularly in the ways we interrogate class gender race politics ideology culture
1405723 but on top of that how can you compare the bolsheviks with any of these silly sex and drugs groups that had their glory days in the 60s
1405724 i dont like to inject myself in matters of art where i know little and i dont want to set standards but i would like to make a request when this art project makes its statues of marx and engels i would like enough realism employed that you can discern their hair and beards and more or less tell who it is
1405725 you do have people getting arrested on the staten island ferry or being prevented from flying for wearing
1405726 well we know they cant win with that so let them just keep reveling in it it is harmless to us
1405727 of course this ignores the fact that sncc and sds where they get the above speech werent about big rock concerts at all in fact they were highly critical even of martin luther king and the mainstream civil rights movement for being too commerial too mainstream too rock star leader friendly
1405728 although what would have happened had those mexican protesters last spring waived mexican and red and black flags instead of american flags
1405729 you could always use the karl dix solution and wear a shirt that says revolutionary
1405730 counter culture fashion image or rhetoric are completely irrelevant but its a lot easier to say or wear the right thing than it is to recruit and train movement leaders a good rule of thumb when youre fighting capitalism if its harder to do its probably more important
1405731 of course the minutemen crowd hates that shit mexican flags etc but i think they hate it even more when the
1405732 fuck you right wingers im wearing this kaffiyah this mexican flag im going to that anti war protest and im selling communist newspapers
1405733 oh youre wearing che shirts selling communist newspapers waiving red flags well hell i used to do that myself youll grow out of it in the meantime well be glad to market all that stuff if it sells
1405734 whole cluster of illusions about that empire about its bourgeois democracy and history about what america really stands for and about what it could become
1405735 i got promoted to supervisor so theres no need to stick with the union
1405736 weve got a pretty good union contract so it doesnt really matter to me how other workers are doing
1405737 were willing to support american foreign policy in exchange for a piece of the pie
1405738 when some immigrants agree to wave the flags it is an illusion when national political forces insist on handing those filthy flags out and trying to ban mexican flags and spanish chants it is a political road that is antithetical to what we need
1405739 im just questioning the assumption that communist agitation as such is slogan mongering whether maoist trotskyite or anarchist
1405740 how can i fight so hard to organize here at x hotel when i know first hand that things still arent going to be good enough even when we have a union
1405741 look the reason things suck at y hotel is that even though you have a union youre still working for a company thats trying to make a profit and doesnt give a shit about you if we keep up the fight i hope someday we wont have bosses and owners and the workers themselves will own their own workplaces
1405742 unions help to instill a moral capitalism in the workplace
1405743 if we won better chairs with a little bit of organizing imagine what we can win if we go on strike or organize the rest of the workers in our industry or
1405744 of the 17 7 million foreign born wage and salary workers in the united states 1 in 10 are members of unions
1405745 the number of foreign born union members rose from 1 4 million in 1996 to 1 8 million in 2003 or by 24 percent the number of working immigrants with union representation increased from 1 6 million in 1996 to 2 0 million in 2003 or by 23 percent
1405746 black workers are more likely to belong to a union 14 5 than whites
1405747 i appreciate r johns nuanced points about what kinds of struggles give rise or could give rise to a revolutionary movement
1405748 but even some of the struggles r john mentions quite clearly were the struggles of immigrant workers in new york city in the early 20th century whose militant industrial unionism inspired and helped establish the cio and the black liberation movement which in my opinion became more powerful and more threatening to the ruling class as it began to confront class based injustice and not merely racial segregation
1405749 what is that relationship between the revolutionary political and the economic
1405750 this took place outside trade unionism the black panthers but also inside mlk was assassinated in memphis while supporting a mass strike of black sanitation workers which was simultaneously a political strike and a
1405751 not to mention the various worker uprisings all over the country associated with the iww and the cio in the first four decades of the 20th century not until the re merger of the afl and the cio in the midst of mccarthyism did the labor movement lose its way completely and even during the cold war there were exceptions to this rule if the expulsion of communists and other radicals from the american labor movement during the cold war had the disastrous results we all agree it had does that mean we should we stay out or fight our way back in
1405752 in my opinion to stay out completely is to cede this important ground to the do nothing labor beaurocrats who are still hanging around trying to manage the decline of the auto industry and other dying industries
1405753 more to the point it is to cede this ground to literally no one at all a complete lack of leadership since the old guard is quickly getting crushed by corporate america and the vast majority of american workers are either neither unionized nor organized in any other way thank goodness there are a whole lot of radicals out there turning some of our unions back into what they should be not insurance agencies or contract negotiating services but engines of class struggle the fact that many of the people posting on this blog dont know or dont believe this is happening can only be attributed either to head in the sand ignorance or to self defeating cynicism
1405754 if it doesnt exist it is our responsibility to create it
1405755 its true as some have pointed out here that the american manufacturing industries and trade union manufacturing therein are dying the future of organizing in that industry lies in workers centers and international solidarity which is why unite before the merger with here helped start usas
1405756 but the future of trade union organizing in this country is in the various service and transportation industries which despite the extreme mobility of capital that r john points out in order to argue that all union organizing is now a dead end cant be moved overseas
1405757 what exactly do people think campaigns like justice for janitors hotel workers rising justice at smithfield and other similar campaigns are about
1405758 you cant separate the u s labor movement from asian exclusion jim crow keeping women out of construction anti immigrant politics prowar cia politics in the 1950s or more recently buy american
1405759 the u s labor movement has always had three programs constrict the labor market keep out foreigners blackpeople women protectionism buy american and in that context force a raise in pay
1405760 you can do some good stuff but at the end of the day youre required to carry out the line of your boss rather than your revolutionary politics
1405761 that doesnt mean workers dont need to fight or that unions beyond afl style
1405762 it just means that you aint never gonna get the kind of sweetheart labor deals won in the 50s and 60s or be able to seriously promise that to the globalized workers of today
1405763 do you know any autoworkers in this country under 50
1405764 it seems to me that the argument for either taking a job in a particular industry or taking a staff job with a union is based either on a belief that this positions one better to build an effective revolutionary movement or on a resignation to the idea that organizing for revolution doesnt make much sense and the best thing to do is to find ways to fight for the amelioration of some of the worse aspects of capitalism
1405765 there are interesting things happening in some sectors of organized labor and they deserve more careful attention than they typically recieve at this site but the absence of a conscious and explitly revolutionary minded political movement confines much of that interesting activity within a horizon of restoring a new deal that is simply not restorable
1405766 it is generally true that organized labor in new york city tends to be more ossified and conservative than the best locals of seiu unite here etc
1405767 id like to see a deeper discussion of how revolutionary minded organizers might help develop the exciting progressive militant section of the labor movement which is growing believe it or not into a
1405768 the precise marxian definition of the proletarian position is substanceless subjectivity which emerges when a certain structural short circuit occurs not only producers exchange their products on the market but there are producers who are forced to sell on the market not the product of their labor but directly their working force as such
1405769 of course there is a crucial break between slumdwellers and the classic marxist working class
1405770 i dont think in anyway this imperialist integration is specific to just trade unions all existing struggles of oppressed and exploited peoples can be intergrated into bourgeois liberal politics in some form there is no magic struggle that is not reconciable by the imperialist system its liberalism and ability to revolutionize itself is key to its staying power in a sense
1405771 even disregarding marxist assumptions about the key role of labor and just starting with my populist assumptions one finds that the main ways in which the u s people are organized are through organized religion and organized labor if we want the people to get organized the workplace is a good starting place with a proven track record of being a basis for drawing people into organization
1405772 unions are not monolithic organizations that are defined by the political positions of their leadership a union is a terrain of struggle with competing interests my union has a history of being racist and anti communist not to mention economist and short sighted however if you really believe that a revolution is possible and necessary in this country at some point youre going to have to deal with a lot of people that you dont like and that disagree with you
1405773 transforming the unions into class struggle organizations that actually fight for something will lead to more workers wanting to join them
1405774 signing this petition is quicker easier and more effective than waiting for a union local to burn so you can refuse to spit on it
1405775 comprehensive immigration reform must avoid the exploitation and abuses of flawed guestworker programs by creating a break the mold worker visa program that will enable law abiding employers access to needed workers while protecting u s and immigrant workers from unfair competition and abuse
1405776 we are especially pleased that senator kennedy d ma and others were able to strengthen the worker protections under the future flow worker visa program contained in the senate judiciary committee bill the bill now contains the following important protections for workers a mechanism to ensure that jobs are first offered to american workers an annual cap on the number of workers admitted prevailing wage protections a prohibition on treating those on three year temporary visas as independent contractors a prohibition on hiring temporary workers in the midst of a labor dispute immediate visa portability so that workers can vote with their feet and change jobs and a mechanism for immigrant workers to apply for permanent residence without having to rely on an employer such protections are essential if we are to substitute the current unregulated flow of easily exploitable undocumented workers with a regulated legal flow of workers with equal labor rights and an eventual path to citizenship
1405777 in this historic moment we have come together as the we are america coalition 2006 to combine our experiences resources and constituencies to effectively fight against the draconian legislative proposal h r 4437 and in favor of humane and just immigration reform together our goals are to keep immigrant families together protect our civil rights pass comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship and mobilize mass public action and support to win such reforms we believe in non violence and in peaceful protests as a symbol of peace amp unity we encourage participants to wear white we will rely on public relations and the strategic use of the mass media as a means of communication we believe in building power through direct action i e marches rallies strikes etc we believe in local coalitions i e building power and acting locally to build a strong and deep movement while our action is local and comes from our grassroots leaders we work in partnership with national organizations and participate in nationally coordinated actions amp campaigns we agree with the need to build a national movement that uplifts multi ethnic communities promotes cultural and racial unity and confronts racism and discrimination in all its forms our principles and goals legalization with path to citizenship for hard working immigrants and their families in america an effective visa program for future immigrants that protects their rights and includes a path to citizenship keep families together protection of our civil rights and civil liberties and no criminalization of immigrants or their allies no to a border wall and increased militarization of the borders

1405787 importance of actually getting deeply into the realm of ideas in its own right really wrangling with ideas and having an open mind about what youre dealing with and then ultimately taking your ideas into the real world into the realm of practice and testing them out there
1405788 this is a very important approach generally from people in the sciences or people generally who work in the realm of ideas and it is something that people who seek to apply the outlook and methodology of communism should be the very best at but that takes work it isnt an automatic thing just because you take up the most scientific the most comprehensive and systematic world outlook and method doesnt mean that you are therefore automatically good at working with ideas or that you automatically arrive at the truth about something and conversely as we have also emphasized there are people who not only dont apply this outlook and method but who disagree with it or even detest it who nevertheless discover important truths and understanding that is also a very important part of really grasping and applying the world outlook and methodology of communism thats the contradictory nature of it
1405789 to try and make your ideas an instrument of your desires and aims
1405790 this did a lot of damage not only in the short run and in a more narrow sense it didnt lead to the results they were hoping for but it also did a lot of damage in the broader sense in terms of how people were being trained to think and how they were being trained to handle the relationship between theory and practice and reality and understanding and transforming reality theres a way in which this has had long term negative consequences first of all it did in the soviet union and it did in the international communist movement because it trained people to think in an erroneous way political expediency dictated what was done there and the people who were critical experts in the field who were reactionaries that pointed to the error of this hypothesis were actually suppressed
1405791 a dictatorship is the rule of one class or another over society backed and enforced by political structures and institutions and ultimately armed force a monopoly of armed force and of legitimate armed force
1405792 how can you have a democracy in which everybody takes part on an equal basis when some people have all kinds of leisure time and sit at the top of this whole process a process that doesnt just involve one country but is worldwide people who to use a certain metaphor are sitting at the top of the food chain eating what is produced by everybody else along the way how can the other people take part equally with them its impossible so naturally these people are going to dominate political affairs and the decision making over the direction of society and they are going to enforce that rule in order to perpetuate the system that has put them in that position in the first place
1405793 even democracy that develops for the masses of people under socialism and we have to learn how to give this even better and more full expression but even the democracy that develops for the masses of people under socialism is part of and could not exist without the dictatorship of the proletariat the rule by the proletariat over society without that state power without that political rule the masses of people would have the same rights they have now essentially nothing when it comes down to the fundamental issues
1405794 the dictatorship of the proletariat the rule that represents the interests of the proletariat has to involve the broad masses of people in all the different aspects of ruling and transforming society which is not a short term thing but a long and very wrenching process of overcoming inequalities which even as they exist are working to undermine your advancing toward a new form of society
1405795 not only is there a question of extending formal rights and equality to the masses of people in a way that can never happen under any form of exploitative rule but there is the question of the masses of people actually having the right to concern themselves with and to influence and to play a decisive role in affairs of state and the direction of society as well as to organize themselves to carry out all kinds of political activity even political activity independent of and in some ways even opposed to the state
1405796 this cannot be overcome all at once not only is this a question of whats left over from the old society there is also a question of where you are at in the process of building the new society and transforming it because in order for everybody to be able to engage in all these different spheres of society you have to be able to produce the material requirements of life with a small amount of the total labor that would go into all the activity in society
1405797 the question is always there what is it nature or nurture that makes us so good

1405802 a reflection of the time that ive spent working with different movements the art of struggle is a political album that encompasses my perspective on a lot of different issues from immigrant rights to the death penalty to the way that children are impacted most by issues like debt on the african continent and also pride for the rebels that are in my heritage
1405803 my high school never had many computers but they always had plenty military recruiters
1405804 how can i open up these issues and in some way try and put them up against each other in one piece and try and do it in a way so you cant get around the way that this same administration this same system is responsible for all of them
1405805 you can call bectel on your nextel and tell em that their pipelines about to catch hell if they think im gonna die for them they aint well im the fire next time and im at their doorbell

1405808 christ loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify it having cleansed it by washing of water by the word
1405809 god hath not called us unto uncleanness but in sanctification
1405810 god hath chosen you a first fruits unto salvation in sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth unto which he also called you through our gospel
1405811 where sin abounded grace superabounded that as sin hath reigned in death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through jesus christ our lord
1405812 how shall we who are such as have died to sin live any longer therein
1405813 i saw the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a green bay tree yet he passed away and lo he was not yea i sought him but he could not be found
1405814 as for man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so he flourisheth for the wind passeth over it and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more
1405815 who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree in order that we having died to sins might live to righteousness
1405816 since therefore christ hath suffered in the flesh arm yourselves also with the same mind because he who hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sins to the end that no longer should he live the rest of the time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god
1405817 every one who is begotten of god does not do sin and he cannot sin because he is begotten of god
1405818 if any one sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous
1405819 the blood of jesus his son cleanseth us from all sin
1405820 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us
1405821 it hath not yet been manifested what we shall be
1405822 every one who has this hope in him i e the father purifieth himself even as he is pure
1405823 if any one see his brother sin a sin not unto death he will ask and he will give him life for those who sin not unto death
1405824 who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind
1405825 neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of god might be made manifest in him
1405826 if ye were blind ye should not have sin but now ye say we see your sin remaineth
1405827 if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin
1405828 every spirit that confesseth jesus christ come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not jesus is not of god
1405829 the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life
1405830 but god being rich in mercy hath made us alive together with christ and hath raised us up together
1405831 sin shall not lord it over you for ye are not under law but under grace
1405832 but now we have been discharged from the law having died to that in which we were held so that we might serve in newness of the spirit and not in the oldness of the letter
1405833 christ being raised from the dead dies no more death no longer lords it over him
1405834 now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out
1405835 and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men to myself
1405836 or do ye not know that as many of us as were baptised into christ jesus were baptised unto his death
1405837 for in that he died he died to sin once for all

1405941 no provision of this act or any amendment made by this act shall be construed as clarifying or implying that internet bets or wagers other than sports bets or wagers which were accepted subsequent to october 13 2006 are in violation of federal law
1405942 federal internet gambling prosecutions have involved sports betting creating a lack of authoritative court decisions on the applicability of other federal criminal statutes to internet poker and casino style gambling
1405943 previous federal case law re mastercard 2002 made it clear that existing federal criminal law wire act of 1961 applies only to sports wagering and not to internet poker further the uigea itself states no provision of this law shall be construed as altering limiting or extending any federal or state law thus h r 6663 only confuses a clear judicial standing on this matter

1405955 with such a move the industry will find its own footing in terms of the kind of support as well as service overall i must say that this will help the consumer because at the end of the day the agents do not have a choice but to increase their level of service

1405963 the governor takes the side of business on a number of issues related to protecting against abuse of the sick day policy he wants a compromise that allows only licensed medical professionals to be eligible to provide medical certification for an employee taking leave
1405964 strickland also wants a policy that would encourage employees to give notice when they are going to use leave and enables businesses to discipline those who repeatedly use accrued leave with little or no notice further the governor wants businesses to be able to manage medical information so they can protect against fraud

1406430 but the sound quality was definitely a cut above without breaking the bank the mason dixons played for a crowd of well over 3 000 using my dynacord xa system comprising six xa subs and four xa top boxes and eight electro voice powered monitors four sxa360 amp four sxa100 i didnt know how big the turnout would be and the xa handled it easily the sound was phenomenal its hard to believe the horizontal coverage this system produces from such a small footprint and we werent even pushing it the whole audience was covered and the stacked system threw a nice combination of punch and intelligibility right to the back of the crowd and of course the band loved the powered ev wedges i roll them in inside a custom designed road case with a compartment for each box and then lift them out onto the deck the whole system is really streamlined and quick to set up yet it has muscle for miles
1406431 this was a six band parking lot show sponsored by pabst though it was a far smaller show they had a few more dollars to spend on pa rental in terms of the cobras capabilities this was a smaller event but the dedicated drive rack makes it quick and easy to fit the system to the show optimizing performance with the presets on the dsp 244 system controller like the xa only minimal tweaking is ever required to get this rig sounding superb though we had enough headroom on hand to fill up a small arena we precisely addressed the space providing just the right balance of power and intelligibility for the indie bands onstage i was also pleased at how precisely these boxes can be aimed we wanted people to be able to talk amongst themselves in certain parts of the lot and were able to aim the boxes to maintain a lower spl in specific areas rather than blasting into the car park with a pile of trap boxes the cobra helped make the lot into a proper venue for the evening
1406432 from the beginning i knew the dynacord solution was perfect for this facility
1406433 and after hearing the system demo the customer agreed we have 40 cobra boxes in our inventory and we use them all the time for all kinds of applications live and installed the new variline boxes are amazing too so compact so versatile so powerful theyre the perfect compliment to the main cobra system
1406434 the main system is a cobra 4 but without the far cabinets each array comprises four top boxes two boxes from each hang cover the main floor with support from variline vl 262 front fills the other two per side cover the deep balcony area the balcony seats around 700 so we needed to ensure good coverage the room is about 80 feet deep so we didnt need the long throw of the far boxes we simply processed the top of each array independently using the dsp 244 part of the dedicated cobra 4 drive rack and only minimal tweaking was required front of house position was built into the balcony so thats where the soundman sits he basically has a cobra 4 as his near field monitors
1406435 this all keeps the sightlines clear and the stage aesthetics tidy it works beautifully
1406436 the vl 262 was introduced to me as a super compact passive box that shared the sonic characteristics of the cobra though obviously on a far smaller scale
1406437 that made sense as we were looking for small footprint front fills for cobra applications like this we use a lot of cobra systems for a wide range of projects so theyre coming in very handy they really kick the combination of two six inch woofers and one high output compression driver provide incredible range and power for such a small unit and keeping the dynacord sound intact across all the speakers adds finesse to each installation or very transparent with the cobra system they blend in sonically and aesthetically because theyre so small you could easily use the vl 262 as mains for smaller venues
1406438 we have enough headroom on hand to power shade some of the boxes if we need to
1406439 and all adjustments can be made from the computer the dsp 244 processors are loaded with the rs 485 remote network interface cards however the system runs very very flat so only minimal eqing is ever necessary we like the cobra for that reason it just sounds good and any tweaking is just a matter of taste

1406492 as people drink less beer than they used to they also look for better more flavored beers people are turning back to ales now
1406493 in a year that saw the british beer market suffer such hefty decline fullers actually grew its volume last year
1406494 we are seeing a resurgence of english ales and english cask ales because people are looking for more personality and character in their beer
1406495 people were enamored of this new beer style that was sold in flashy cans it was served colder you never had a bad pint but you never had a good pint so people flocked to it
1406496 and maybe women saw it as more glamorous than a pint of real ale
1406497 sales are falling because four global breweries have more than 80 percent of the uk beer market and all they seem to produce these days are global beer brands that youll find anywhere in the world so its very boring

1406499 there are 600 microbreweries in the uk and 35 family brewers this sector of the market is very active

1406596 as weve grown in the past few years we became aware of a lot of business challenges related to our company name and branding as our business to business direct sales grew and the educational branch grew we knew we needed a unifying brand that could be used across the board and alte a name many of us our service providers and customers already used was a natural and easy choice its also friendly short and easier to say
1406597 weve been in the alternative energy business for a while and the technology is exciting but can also be intimidating to the individual homeowner we want to make renewable energy easier to do and accessible to everyone because now it truly is many of the technologies we offer are now at prices that make it competitive with traditional solutions and we can help you figure out how quickly youll recoup your investment at the same time youll be making a difference to the environment at an individual level the new branding is designed to make us more accessible as we grow we want everyone to know and remember alte is a friendly company with a knowledgeable staff that wants choosing buying and installing a renewable energy system easier we want to make renewable do able
1406598 at the foundation of our business we have wanted to grow a community and inspire everyone to implement alternative energy technology and renewable energy products its great that governments are finally signing the right laws and creating stronger policy but we believe we can make a bigger difference by reaching individuals and helping them make a difference at a personal level plus this stuff is really cool
1406599 we hope that the new branding and the informative campaigns we have planned for the fall will help people see their renewable energy options and realize that going green can be fun economical and make you feel really good

1406669 in many readings with clients i am shown that the body is energetically out of balance which manifests in all sorts of pain dis ease and physical ailments that range from discomfort to acute and chronic conditions
1406670 the source of many of these conditions lies in the lifestyle beliefs and messages that the client has created which creates stress that are being shown to them through the body
1406671 the body is the physical vehicle that the spirit operates through
1406672 obesity is a global problem but we are not a planet of physically obese people we are a planet of emotionally exhausted unhappy people who need spiritual relief and to find joy
1406673 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

1406707 i thought this kind of stuff only happens in india
1406708 i havent been out of the game that long but its nice to think i havent been forgotten
1406709 we have to look at the longevity of this game and im not talking the next 10 years but the next 50 and 100 years
1406710 we were lucky once when britain took the game to all corners of the globe but we no longer have that luxury and have to investigate new areas for the sport
1406711 i think becoming part of the olympic movement will enhance that and twenty20 is the perfect vehicle to take the sport forward

1406716 the clubs have been told we can appeal against mistaken identity or if we feel the referee has got it wrong with red cards
1406717 but when i sounded ffa out today i was told that can only happen when the season starts
1406718 weve now got to wear that craig misses the first game against wellington he was coming back from a two match suspension from last seasons preliminary final against newcastle
1406719 my view is that if a player is sent off or receives x amount of yellow cards in the pre season cup it should be served in that competition the next season and not in the league it kills the clubs
1406720 personally i would like to see the pre season competition scrapped altogether and the clubs organise their own friendlies
1406721 i see no reason for the competition to be scrapped simply because some players incurred yellow or red card offences

1406788 theres a little bit more to it than i was aware of at the time
1406789 sometimes you go into a situation you have pretty good players there who are in disarray you straighten them out they get confidence and all of a sudden youre pretty good
1406790 you go into other situations where you may not have as many good players its going to take a little more time to recruit your way out of it
1406791 i thought we went from one extreme to a totally different one this was
1406792 he didnt take a play off the whole day even when he made mistakes it was he worked like jerious norwood used to work from top to bottom
1406793 i went hard last year but this year im stepping it up even a bigger notch plays when im tired and im breathing im just telling myself one more one more rep and im going even harder
1406794 i didnt renew several scholarships because i wanted to send a message whether it was that i didnt think they were giving us enough effort in the classroom of not enough effort in the weight room or just attitude because scholarships are one year renewals
1406795 the speed and intensity and tempo of the practice then putting that together with the heat it was extremely tough
1406796 weve got to come out here every day and get used to it we worked out a little bit in the summer with the heat but running full speed every play youve got to get used to it
1406797 there was a period where the o line wasnt moving around and giving us any emotion and fire and you go where your offensive line goes the heat was a part of it and we didnt do a good job with it with the first practice
1406798 hes very fast very quick and hes tough the heat it didnt bother him at all he was tough and just went hard every play
1406799 its tough knowing that you cant play no matter how hard youre practicing but you got to keep working to next year and you have to help your teammates get better
1406800 you have been convicted of extremely serious charges and im not prepared to grant you bail you will be remanded in custody meantime

1406805 we carried out several exams and we didnt find a single problem he has not had any kind if injury over the last two or three years he was in perfect health at hamburg and he is ready and able to play for schuster
1406806 keep in mind that most european leagues are in full swing it is only the spanish league that hasnt quite begun
1406807 at the conclusion of the last season we made it clear that there would be very few but very good incorporations for the new year a logical decision having won two straight league titles and signed several young successful and dedicated players it was a commitment that this board of directors followed through on and brought to a happy ending van der vaart is the first incorporation of the year and most likely the only incorporation of the year we feel the squad is very well rounded very talented and above all a united family which believes in the pillars of drive hard work sacrifice and commitment
1406808 rafael van der vaart is only 25 years old but has been playing in top flight football since the age of 17 the first five seasons with ajax and the last three for hamburg at 18 he was called up for preparation matches for the german world cup he has won two leagues one cup and one super cup he fulfills one of our commitments made and the end of last year which was to bring in an extraordinary talented player a defensive midfielder who can score who has a great vision for the game and a ton of talent a player who will surely help us a lot next season he has just signed a five year deal with this club which is the mininum he will be here we are absolutely positive that he will help complete the great squad we already have we are also fortunate that he is half spanish
1406809 thank you mr president i dont speak much spanish but i am very happy to be able to play for real madrid the best team in the world thank you to all of you for making this possible i am looking forward to joining the squad to playing and to winning many titles hala madrid

1406817 expanding super rugby is what the game needs there is no deviation from that aim
1406818 i would think any suggestions of creating a competition of that nature is a retrograde step and its certainly not something i understand to be on australias rugby agenda
1406819 it comes as something as a surprise i couldnt see how that competition would be of higher quality than the super 14
1406820 all of that is at least 50 percent better than what it was

1406919 this is very suggestive that there is a fundamental change going on in the electorate
1406920 obviously these are not good numbers for the party to be looking at democrats have always had extremely broad multifaceted registration programs
1406921 i think the key in this one is where do all these new independent voters break
1406922 i think right now youve got a guy in western pennsylvania saying i am really disgusted right now and im not going to register as a republican anymore but i really dont want this guy obama elected
1406923 i think nationally and here people are kind of tired of the way this administration has been conducting the policies of this country

1406932 is partly determined by how closely intertwined the contractor is with the government officials
1406933 one of the interesting things that i think were seeing is that courts are not willing to throw these cases out when the contractor has a fair degree of discretion
1406934 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1406935 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1406936 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1406937 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1406938 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1406939 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1406940 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1406941 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1406942 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1406943 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1406944 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1406945 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1406946 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1406947 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1406948 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1406949 in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1406950 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1406951 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1406952 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line

1406954 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1406955 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1406956 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1406957 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1406958 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1406959 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1406960 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11

1407012 dieses durchaus provokante interview zu dem ich stehe einen positiven nebeneffekt f r die zukunft dass auch prominente spd mitglieder die sich gegen den kurs der partei stellen lernen sich ein bisschen zur ckzuhalten sich solidarischer zu verhalten damit die spd zur sachpolitik zur ckkehren kann

1407017 i am intimately familiar with where my name appears online everybodys guilty of googling themselves from time to time or all the time

1407021 not all pain causing methods are prosecutable abuse but the risk of a dog with aggressive behaviors being abused by someone who uses pain causing methods is high so yes given the choice if it were my dog who had an aggression problem and my only choices were to euthanize or send it to someone who used pain causing methods i would choose euthanasia for the dogs well being i think a gently death is preferable to abuse
1407022 theyd rather have a dog euthanized than ever use an e collar to help train it and save its life

1407028 the race for women is not deiced yet though they are giving obama a solid lead

1407082 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate
1407083 cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media

1407094 in its view sprint and clearwire are not being made to jump through as many hoops and it doesnt think thats fair
1407095 the new clearwire transaction presents an unparalleled opportunity to accelerate broadband deployment in the united states
1407096 only three parties opposed the transaction or proposed conditions their claims lack merit and provide no basis for denying delaying or imposing conditions on the approval of the new clearwire license transfers
1407097 nearly 100 parties including numerous educational and religious institutions and commercial operators recognize the significance of this opportunity and have filed comments urging the commission to approve the transaction expeditiously
1407098 as the record demonstrates the proposed transaction will create a new vibrant broadband competitor and promote innovation the transaction poses no competitive concerns and the public interest strongly weighs in favor of quick commission approval

1407146 why not give a straight up or down for drilling
1407147 because the misrepresentation is being made that this is going to reduce the price at the pump this is again a decoy
1407148 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling and so we dont want gridlock
1407149 basically cools the passion of environmentalists knowing its not going anywhere while he is open to compromise on a comprehensive package that would achieve many other objectives

1407155 i see a lot of what i saw last year in the second half of the season
1407156 i see a guy that not only can rush the passer and has speed to get the corner but hes also becoming a much more complete player were running the ball left in our 9 on 7 drills more than we ever had just to try to get him ready for the regular season and obviously we want to try to become a better running team left and right inside and out hes a more complete player and hes got great upside
1407157 if hes doing his job as a returner thats what he was brought here to do
1407158 so whatever else we get that stuff is gravy i think with the juice that hes got when coach jon gruden goes back to his little laboratory hell come up with some creative ways to get him the ball

1407212 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
1407213 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
1407214 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
1407215 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
1407216 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
1407217 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

1407222 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
1407223 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

1407234 its a painful process and some riders still havent realised they cant get away with doping anymore but theyre getting caught and now weve got another one
1407235 this was a targeted control that was done on july 23 just a few days after the positives in the tour de france we sent the sample to paris for testing for cera the decision to do the test was based on specific information i dont know exactly what but it could include anomalies with whereabouts information suspicious performances and information from other people it wasnt rocket science after seeing sellas performances in the mountains that something wasnt right

1407238 the prime minister did not speak during our brief tribute certainly not i dont think he even looked up the snarling business of question period having just ended he was shuffling papers i tried to bring him close to me with my eyes who is this man what makes him tick no doubt he is busy no doubt he is deluded by that busyness no doubt being prime minister fills his entire consideration and froths his sense of busied importance to the very brim and no doubt he sounds and governs like one who cares little for the arts but he must have moments of stillness and so this is what i propose to do not to educate that would be arrogant less than that to make suggestions to his stillness for as long as stephen harper is prime minister of canada i vow to send him every two weeks mailed on a monday a book that has been known to expand stillness that book will be inscribed and will be accompanied by a letter i will have written i will faithfully report on every new book every inscription every letter and any response i might get from the prime minister on this website

1407282 while its clear there is benefit to a significant number of men its equally clear that many men end up being diagnosed and treated for cancers that would likely not have caused them any significant harm
1407283 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1407284 thats because every 75 year old is not created equal
1407285 very active very vigorous and have minimal health issues and many of those men are going to live into their late 80s or 90s

1407289 previous analyses of routine hospital admission data from the us and italy have reported reductions in heart attacks following the introduction of smoking bans however our scottish study is the first to examine the impact of the legislation on smokers and non smokers separately
1407290 we have been able to demonstrate that two thirds of the observed reduction in heart attack has occurred in non smokers and the results of the blood tests confirmed a reduction in exposure to second hand smoke among non smokers we believe that most of the reduction can be attributed to the introduction of the scottish smoking ban
1407291 this evaluation of impact of smoke free legislation is the most comprehensive yet conducted and the findings have exceeded our greatest expectations
1407292 the findings from the scottish study of heart attacks are of worldwide importance and the combined results from the evaluation provide a compelling case for other countries to implement a comprehensive ban on smoking in public places as soon as possible thereby reducing the harm caused by second hand smoke however it is essential that smoke free legislation is set within the context of wider tobacco control activity as outlined in the who framework convention on tobacco control an international treaty designed to reduce both the demand for and the supply of tobacco products
1407293 this raft of research demonstrates the significant public health benefits that the smoking ban is already having in scotland it provides evidence that the legislation is improving the health of everyone in scotland including smokers non smokers children and barworkers one of the most important findings is the reduction in heart attacks we believe that the smoking ban was a large contributory factor to this drop and i am confident that we will continue to see the positive effects of the ban in years to come

1407306 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1407307 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1407308 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1407309 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around

1407343 we waren behoorlijk van slag het enige wat we op dat moment wisten was dat we zoiets nooit meer mee wilden maken daarom richtten we ons eigen label op nul records
1407344 we zullen nul records alleen gebruiken voor ons eigen werk het is onlogisch om andere bands te tekenen want dan brengen we ze in een situatie waarin we zelf juist nooit meer willen zitten
1407345 het werkt bevrijdend nu we niemand meer verantwoording verschuldigd zijn
1407346 het album is primitief simplistisch het moest vooral geschikt zijn om live te spelen een nummer als radio heart ontstond terwijl we het opnamen daardoor is het een heel spontaan album geworden
1407347 er was destijds geen recente geschiedenis van goede britse popmuziek ineens ontstonden overal in het land frisse bands die teruggrepen op de jaren 80 we konden op die stroming meeliften waren we enkele jaren eerder gekomen dan hadden we er helemaal alleen voor gestaan zouden we daarentegen nu pas met ons debuut komen dan was de concurrentie veel groter veel mensen in europa zullen ons misschien nog steeds niet kennen maar het voordeel dat wij hebben ten opzichte van nieuwe bands is onze ervaring wij hebben al drie albums uit dat kan de rest niet zeggen

1407464 we want this to be a one stop center for people looking for information
1407465 what i really want people to do is recognize that becoming a bone marrow donor is no longer a painful process

1407475 why me was basically the only thing going through my head
1407476 this was a goon squad of angry cops out for retaliation
1407477 the cops passed through the bar area made obscene comments to female patrons a brawl broke out
1407478 my client didnt have anything to do with it but was forced to defend himself
1407479 they pushed him into an undercover car and drove him to yonkers while police took turns punching rui in the face
1407480 patient requests not to be released because police will kill me tonight
1407481 you have an assault by a goon squad and then an assault by the district attorney
1407482 we called the police my wife was afraid he was going to get ran over or hit
1407483 he looked a little agitated but other than that he didnt look to be falling down drunk or anything like that
1407484 im not an officer but i dont see the reason for tasering somebody lying there with a broken back i dont consider that a threat
1407485 according to the doctors all injuries are consistent with a fall
1407486 they tested his system he was clean of drugs and alcohol we dont know why unless just being in shock and the whole thing in itself caused him to forget everything
1407487 the tasering increased his white blood cell count and caused him to have a temperature so they could not go into the operation
1407488 he refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their tasers in order to subdue him
1407489 he is making incoherent statements hes also making statements such as shoot cops kill cops things like that so there was cause for concern to the officers

1407498 short term impact of strategic initiatives to revitalise the reebok brand in the usa the uk and japan
1407499 we have laid the foundation at reebok for continued improvement in the second half of the year

1407504 while gdp growth may reach or possibly breach six percent in second quarter of 2008 it may also signal the beginning of a cyclical downtrend going into the second half of 2008
1407505 the continued slowdown in electronics and electrical e amp e exports in june reaffirms our view that growth trajectory could have peaked
1407506 while gdp growth may reach or possibly exceed six per cent in the second quarter of 2008 it signals the beginning of a downtrend going into the second half
1407507 thanks to the base effect as well as strong commodity driven external demand the second quarter 2008 trade performance was the highest since third quarter 2004 at 20 8 per cent
1407508 malaysias trade performance took a breather in june though surprisingly higher than what we had expected as receipts from mineral and agricultural commodity remains relatively high
1407509 in the next five months we would know if the austerity drive by the government and the fall in consumer purchasing power have an impact on the companies but it the impact may be seen next year
1407510 we found that about 10 per cent of the cheques sent to taxpayers were not received by them
1407511 we also have to take into account the additional tax assessment on bonuses
1407512 this is because when we launched the phone in singapore on june 16 we sold 15 000 units within a month and in such a small market
1407513 we will be advertising heavily this year particularly on outdoor billboard and bus advertisement
1407514 jockey is the only brand which adopts the 3d technology on undergarments besides the use of high quality fabrics such as lycra modal and tencel
1407515 we hope to sign mou memorandum of understanding with indonesia such agreement will encourage a policy of palm based biofuel that both countries can use
1407516 it is very important and there are many other subjects that we can work together

1407528 im not sure the fed is really in as much of a box as people think
1407529 we dont believe inflation is as much of a problem as it appears
1407530 i wouldnt read too much into it i dont think the fed has been right about inflation we had a parabolic rise in a lot of these commodities now were getting a correction and youve seen an overcorrection in some instances i anticipate that this is probably short lived
1407531 with oil and commodity prices not growing nearly as rapidly as earlier this year headline inflation rates are set to moderate by the end of the year
1407532 the fed is likely to continue with hawkish rhetoric reiterating its vigilance against inflation but also noting their expectation that slack in the economy should help mitigate inflationary pressure over several quarters
1407533 recent pmi data indicate that the global economy has downshifted considerably at mid year

1407559 well i dont know i was debating whether or not to get the shot all morning its an anti inflammatory so that should cut down on the pain but there are other ways to do that less inflammation should lead to healing but i know how id feel if i go through with getting a very painful shot in my foot and then it doesnt help

1407580 we get in work mode get comfortable and go through the material thats in the computer dre always has hit records sometimes artists that need producers they need someone to create a direction for them musically i need the jewels hes just got laying around he dont gotta tell me what to do with it all he has to do is say track six or go to track eight hell have hits playing there you just have to get in and get them
1407581 hopefully hell get it done and put it out im waiting for the detox all i can say is dr dre is the best producer in my eyes just the consistency over the years he knows what he wants hes such a perfectionist that it becomes difficult for him to put it out

1407585 sarebbe gravemente minata lautosufficienza nazionale a causa della paradossale circostanza per cui il donatore a fronte di un gesto di solidariet con valenza assistenziale strategica si troverebbe svantaggiato a livello stipendiale

1407606 jva made it incredibly convenient to take these classes and to make it happen in your world
1407607 i never felt stupid i always felt like i was learning youre just treated like a peer or a colleague whos trying to live a better life and make a difference
1407608 i think if you want to challenge your level of professionalism its really worth investing your time energy and money for
1407609 if you cant find it here youre not going to find it anywhere

1407616 he is an extraordinarily talented producer whose creative contributions to the no 1 show on television have been immeasurable
1407617 a new way to measure the value you get from the fees you pay to your own mutual funds and exchange traded funds
1407618 its pointless to generalize about the value that investors get for the mutual fund fees they pay some funds are outstanding many are middling and some are pretty bad
1407619 the etf scoring worst on the fund fee index beat the mutual fund with the best score
1407620 basically its a man in a very colorful jumpsuit with something attached to a long pole going its swooping its swooping its coming around its coming down
1407621 at first when you are reacting to a traffic cone on a stick its a bit hilarious the hardest thing was not to laugh
1407622 it was a learning curve for all of us and there were a lot of giggles along the way
1407623 but now when you see new characters come to the show and you see those actors struggle with it you realize how its become part of your life so i dont find it tough any more
1407624 it gave me a skill set where you say well what else can this do
1407625 if you obey the rules and design a creature based on biology or something that did exist then people go oooh that looks real
1407626 its a fantastic relief not to have to worry about the length of their teeth and the size of nostril hair
1407627 so i could add an extra sabre tooth to the gorgonopsid and no one cared because this is drama
1407628 when effects step out of the background and become an active participant among the characters that changes the dynamic alters the drama that gives you something audiences hadnt seen before
1407629 if you look at space operas they show flying machines and occasionally people walk on in a pair of rubber ears personally i think the age of rubber ears is over what you need to do is to produce believable digital characters
1407630 because i can stick as many monsters in front of you as i like but unless you fell for the characters the team you would not be interested
1407631 will irrevocably damage the universitys ability to fulfill its core mission
1407632 this reduction on top of the earlier 52 million cut from the general fund will make it impossible to fulfill that mission and could result in tens of thousands of students being turned away or closed out of courses needed for graduation
1407633 it is inconceivable that suny is being directed to absorb an overall cut of 148 million in anticipated state aid just weeks before classes are scheduled to resume
1407634 eat food not too much mostly plants everything else is an unpacking of those words and an explanation as to why that should be so
1407635 so since youre a priest does that mean you took a quantum leap of faith

1407668 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
1407669 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1407670 to those who say the challenge is not politically viable i suggest they go before the american people and try to defend the status quo then bear witness to the peoples appetite for change
1407671 some of our greatest accomplishments as a nation have resulted from commitments to reach a goal that fell well beyond the next election the marshall plan social security the interstate highway system
1407672 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1407673 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first

1407725 this exploit targets a fairly ubiquitous flaw in dns implementations which allow the insertion of malicious dns records into the cache of the target nameserver this exploit caches a single malicious host entry into the target nameserver by causing the target nameserver to query for random hostnames at the target domain the attacker can spoof a response to the target server including an answer for the query an authority server record and an additional record for that server causing target nameserver to insert the additional record into the cache
1407726 in fact of the 60 dns servers i tested more than half of them were still vulnerable
1407727 considering that many of the safe dns servers were not vulnerable prior to this situation this means that far fewer than half of the large isps have even reacted to the notice

1407741 the best follow up to last years award winning camaro concept is a camaro convertible
1407742 the camaro convertible concept instantly evokes an emotional response its a vehicle that you want to make room for in your garage
1407743 the light on dark interior coloring makes a strong statement that conveys the spirit of freedom and fun that is embodied by a camaro convertible

1407746 the new camaro concepts bridge heritage with contemporary style with a design that is simultaneously admired among import influenced youth and traditional enthusiasts
1407747 camaro has always represented the american ethic that style and performance dont belong exclusively to the wealthy
1407748 camaro has always been everybodys sports car and these new concepts demonstrate its spirit is relevant for a new generation

1407762 this particular project has the potential to seriously impact the residents of pompton lakes
1407763 i think that they should go forward with their property as it is get that done with and down the road when it is time to look at the other side then come back the urgency is not now
1407764 in 1968 when it was just pompton lakes they had 752 students
1407765 it would be nice if these ratables can be used for tax relief so retired people who want to maintain their houses and who dont want to give up something that is owned free they can afford to continue to live here

1407772 no wonder keith wished dana good luck if he is going to be opposite countdown i would have said lot s of luck buddy why is it that so many people especially men cannot admit it when they make a mistake one of the things i do admire about keith he corrects things and does not allow them to become a big deal perhaps when one is that large there is no need to protect one s manly image this was not forcing dana to support obama but holding him to journalistic integrity not to distort what had been said to give a totally skewed impression wondering if i now need to sell my copy of homo politicus at a garage sale and thinking not as i loved the book
1407773 conservative blogger robert cox who writes the national debate blog told me he was amazed at the quality of wikipedia and thought it was a great resource
1407774 i dont know if you saw the 6 oclock news tonight but there was quite a lot on the energy policy and the offshore drilling flip flopping back and forth and i meant to ask both of you especially you mr myers whats your policy on that
1407775 we have got to find new oil immediately there are 800 million barrels of shale oil in zimmer agrees with myers on shale coal but said he believed in a comprehensive approach to the current energy crisis
1407776 we need more efficiency we need more conservation we need to develop alternative sources of power like solar and wind
1407777 but we also do need to develop our own domestic sources so we stop shipping 700 billion a year overseas for energy to countries who very often do not have our best interests at heart its a national security issue
1407778 i just dont understand if we have it and we can get it why hasnt it been done can the two of you address that issue
1407779 there is progress being made on clean coal technology and i do support a federal investment in clean coal technology and we do have huge coal reserves
1407780 which if they can be converted to oil or be burned in power plants in a clean way here you have carbon sequestration that would open up a very important business for our energy future
1407781 dear hope you enjoy your vacation get back to work
1407782 just this week giffords who represents 120 miles of the most loosely guarded border area with was allowed to take the lead on a bill that is seen as critical for conservative democrats being questioned on illegal immigration
1407783 what people are looking for in this district is fundamental principles and this shifting around and chasing the winds of change arent going to sit well
1407784 in hindsight thats 2 million barrels a day of oil that would be pouring into our economy and we could maybe kick at least the saudis or the nigerians out of the supply chain
1407785 as long as were making progress its in our interest to stay there
1407786 our task is to keep working hard knocking on doors talking to those people just getting our people motivated

1407817 i think we made it a little harder on ourselves by not moving the ball around as much
1407818 we didnt make our outside shots tonight as well as weve been in the past but at the end of the day we won the ballgame we found a way to win
1407819 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ballgame
1407820 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1407821 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1407822 we cant have those type of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball
1407823 what theyve done and where you see them can intimidate a lot of people

1407840 i told her the baby was safe in gods hands
1407841 we obviously have some sort of mental problem that will rise to the level of not guilty by reason of insanity or not even being competent to stand trial

1407853 i became involved with yes to carrots during a business meeting with israels leading product formulator mr uri ben hur for a completely unrelated project
1407854 acquired the training required to catapult yes to carrots into one of the fastest growing personal care brands in the world
1407855 whose mission is to discover and develop unique and exciting brands in the health and beauty industry and share them with the world
1407856 i was involved along with my business partner lance kalish and uri ben hur one of israels foremost product formulators we grew from a team of 3 to what is now a truly global team spanning the world the company today employs people from every corner of the world just in the marketing office there are over 15 languages
1407857 yes to carrots arrived in the us in december 2006 and was sold initially on walgreens com we invested in creating online buzz and got some initial coverage in the major beauty publications with the goal of getting on walgreens 6000 store shelves in july 2007 we hit the stores and have been growing strong ever since in addition to walgreens we are now sold in the us at duane reade and ulta the brand went international about the same time we arrived in the us it was lots of hard work but we participated in some of the international trade shows where we were able to meet with the retailers and show them our commitment to working closely with them weve even got yes to carrots packaging in cantonese dutch russian and italian we are working now on 3 more languages its incredible to think that 18 months ago we were only in 16 stores in israel and now yes to carrots is in 17 countries in nearly 18 000 stores around the world
1407858 are bursting with beta carotene a natural form of vitamin a which is a great antioxidant and helps keep your hair and skin looking young
1407859 as i said before carrots are pretty universal and in my travels around the world ive seen that its one of the first foods children eat pretty much universally so theres an inherent connection to this vegetable
1407860 our number one goal has always been to make people happy
1407861 along with my wife weve made the decision to live a healthy and happy life and were intent on helping others to do the same i strongly believe that when you say yes to yes to carrots you are making a conscious decision to smile more often improve your lifestyle and help others live healthy
1407862 too many messages we receive today are negative and it turns out this is a global phenomenon so we decided to spread a very positive message globally one yes at a time i think its about staying positive were in a time now when lots is going on politically socially and economically that stresses families out for example we just want your first morning moments in the shower to give you a boost give you a reason to smile and exude that well being throughout the day if you look at our shampoo the directions instruct you to apply shampoo to wet hair while singing how can you have a bad day when it starts out like that

1407903 the threat of a new ice age must now stand alongside nuclear war as a likely source of wholesale death and misery for mankind
1407904 the cooling since 1940 has been large enough and consistent enough that it will not soon be reversed
1407905 in the 1970s hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death
1407906 if i were a gambler i would take even money that england will not exist in the year 2000
1407907 the world as we know it will likely be ruined by the year 2000
1407908 civilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind
1407909 somewhere between 75 and 85 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct
1407910 inaction on global warming will be catastrophic and those who dont die will be cannibals
1407911 we only have ten years before the total complete and irreparable destruction of our oceans
1407912 the implication is this this decision by the epa through the use of the esa is as monumental decision as row v wade was for abortion rights brown v board of education for civil rights or the dred scott decision was for slavery and states rights this is the first time the endangered species act has been used to protect a species threatened by the impacts of global warming this means that global warming is now illegal for example if the esa says the spotted owl is endangered due to logging virgin pine then logging virgin pine is automatically illegal if the manatee is officially endangered due to lowered motor blades in certain parts of the everglades then running a lowered blade in that part of the everglades is illegal this gives the government unprecedented power to mandate over reaching and fascist authority over business and private enterprise for the good of the polar bear not just in the arctic but anywhere in the country because global warming is well global
1407913 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
1407914 the critical problem is the sea ice is changing were looking ahead three generations 30 to 50 years
1407915 sure theres no evidence polar bears are decreasing in population but they could fifty years from now
1407916 this lawsuit and palins head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear govenor palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear
1407917 so utterly ridiculously crazy as to leave ones brainpower equivalent to that of a bowl of beans
1407918 the way twins management handled this whole situation has driven me completely insane and im not even a twins fan
1407919 to wait until august 3 to slot liriano into the rotation and presumably dump hernandez is so so myopic dumb the best word to describe it may be crizazlebeans stay tuned for other realizations by twins management including the groundbreaking discovery that uranium is delicious but also deadly
1407920 we are very pleased to sponsor trevor and heather as they continue what can only be described as an incredible first year as professionals
1407921 as amazing as heathers bike split at coeur dalene was we know shell ride even faster at the hawaii ironman on our new full carbon multisport bike the triadtm we have heather and trevor working in the a2 wind tunnel to optimize their riding positions

1407928 but i have a lot of jamaican friends a lot of jamaican friends
1407929 one thing i always say is that jamaicans are one set of people who are proud to be themselves
1407930 i feel like i failed in this situation sometimes for the better good of the whole some parts have to be sacrificed because somewhere along the line everybody has to realize they are responsible for their actions you dont get an open checkbook to keep writing checks on a balance that is no longer there
1407931 well move forward and that puts mike hartline front and center at the quarterback position
1407932 we will take a long hard look at will fidler and a couple of the freshmen that are working at that position obviously this is not the way i envisioned starting the season but it makes things a little more clear for everyone involved
1407933 its its kind of like christianity but it blends a lot of pantheism into the concept of god theres a lot of eastern influence present in my beliefs erhm i call it brattism

1407945 my land free from the mafia this is my dream this is my struggle
1407946 we live in italy in europe but this is a war and we are not free that is not an exaggeration that is the reality the cosa nostra deals in weapons drugs and people it demands so called protection money from businessmen it obtains public works contracts by fraud and sells highly toxic waste the mafiosi make billions
1407947 the italian government has stopped the states fight against the mafia and the mafia has stopped its war against the state but the cosa nostra has not disappeared rather it has become invisible and changed its strategy they dont have to shoot anyone anymore they already have all the power and are stronger than ever policemen and district attorneys confirm this terrible allegation

1407958 in the complex and fast paced world of medicine where patient safety is a primary concern physicians need to be assured that they are using agents and the best possible safety profile this is particularly important with agents that affect heart rhythm and may predispose patients to life threatening arrhythmias that can occur without warning
1407959 many urologists and other physicians who treat bph dont often have access to ecg to monitor the cardiac safety of the agents they prescribe
1407960 therefore its important that physicians recognize which agents affect the qtc interval and to avoid those agents if an alternative is available

1407971 the first vehicle after the horse cavalry ended was a six wheeled all terrain type close to our eight wheeled stryker that the 14th cavalry received after being re activated at fort lewis wash back in 2000
1407972 when we presented it to maj highfill his expression showed how valuable this vehicle was to him it was incredible to see
1407973 as an infectious disease doctor ive always felt that a vaccine is that ultimate victory in our war against bugs
1407974 i think this month we really want to focus on the full spectrum from the newborn to the older person and the importance of vaccines and understanding when those are due throughout your life

1408000 your grief is unfounded because your loved one hasnt really died he she has just lost his her body which isnt really who he she is anyway so grieving and crying are for those who dont really understand the truth of what has happened death isnt real if youre enlightened enough to see the reality behind the appearances your grief will vanish

1408047 every time you see them they are stronger we have beaten them before and our confidence should be right
1408048 for me its not personal the way i see it there are a lot of people like me like how i am about my husband my candidate they invested their hearts and souls into hillary clinton and many of them did this for years they have to figure out how they want to leverage their political power i understand that politics is a patience game you cant do this unless you have patience
1408049 just like it would also be a really big deal if hillary clinton had won because there has never been a woman nominee for president and women used to not be able to vote and didnt have many rights either
1408050 we favor both funds for many of the same reasons both have experienced top flight management supported by robust credit research staffs
1408051 both bond funds have performed strongly over the long term and during recent market turbulence
1408052 pimco total return is the worlds biggest bond fund and second large mutual fund of any stripe with 128 billion in assets
1408053 pimco total is a reliable core bond fund holding for most any investors gross approach is both deliberate and opportunistic he builds the portfolio around pimcos macroeconomic outlook which is developed on a firm wide bases and looks out three to five years
1408054 this outlook is honed and refined quarterly and specific shorter term impacts to interest rates credit and economic factors are considered and used to shape individual security selection
1408055 the fund invests mainly in investment grade bonds of intermediate maturity that means it typically does not make significant interest rate bets despite this moderate sensibility gross has made several moves that should bolster returns
1408056 one pimco total return has avoided treasuries and tips which gross thinks provide poor protection from inflation at current levels the fund has also benefited from exposure to foreign interest rates and currencies especially the euro and emerging markets currencies
1408057 gross has stated his preference for the compelling value of high quality mortgages which have attractive yields relative to treasuries mortgage related securities make up nearly two thirds of the portfolio
1408058 and the fund has emphasized short duration that is lower interest rate sensitivity as evidenced by the portfolios low duration of 4 years relatives to the lehman brothers aggregate bond index duration of 4 5 years
1408059 loomis sayles bond is co managed by dan fuss and kathleen gaffney the 17 9 billion fund is run in a go anywhere fashion and they are not afraid to make significant bets on interest rates or sectors of the economy or the bond market
1408060 their portfolios broad reach makes it reasonably well diversified though and an able core bond holding despite its harder charging approach
1408061 performance has been outstanding the funds 10 year annualized return of 8 5 outpaces the lehman brothers aggregate bond index by 2 7 annual an enormous disparity in bond returns
1408062 the funds performance over the past year has been solid 4 1 return but has lagged the broad index and more conservative peers owing to its narrow holdings of treasuries whose prices soared earlier this year as risk averse investors fled from even high quality assets to treasuries
1408063 the funds average maturity recently 13 8 years and duration 7 years expose it to significantly more interest rate risk than pimco total return however the managers favor securities that have low correlations to the broader bond market and less sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates
1408064 strong research capabilities allows fuss and gaffney to identify securities they believe to be undervalued and the funds broad mandate allows them to invest wherever such opportunities arise

1408283 the objectives of this research was to determine the effects of raising and lowering posted speed limits on driver behavior and accidents for non limited access rural and urban highways speed and accident data were collected in 22 states at 100 sites before and after speed limits were altered before and after data were also collected simultaneously at comparison sites where speed limits were not changed to control for the time trends repeated measurements were made at 14 sites to examine short and long term effects of speed limit changes the results of the study indicated that lowering posted speed limits by as much as 20 mi h 32 km h or raising speed limits by as much as 15 mi h 24 km h had little effect on motorist speed the majority of motorist did not drive 5 mi h 8 km h above the posted speed limits when speed limits were raised nor did they reduce their speed by 5 or 10 mi h 8 or 16 km h when speed limits are lowered data collected at the study sites indicated that the majority of speed limits are posed below the average speed of traffic lowering speed limits below the 50th percentile does not reduce accidents but does significantly increase driver violations of the speed limit conversely raising the posted speed limits did not increase speeds or accidents

1408302 it gave us a real flavor of how safe the neighborhood was that was really important to us
1408303 really gives you a good feel for the house before you get into it
1408304 you have to make sure your pictures are of good quality and done when the listing is put in you have a short window of time and have to really give them a feel for that house in seconds
1408305 youve got to keep up with how people use technology such as cell phones and personal digital devices such as blackberrys so they can react with whatever information you have
1408306 there were houses not in areas where potential buyers were searching but they saw the interiors of the rooms and one of them just got accepted because of that
1408307 its not just going to show part of the picture it will be sized to the screen
1408308 sometimes the outside of the house may not be pleasing to the eye
1408309 i really like them because i can get them out to realtors without having to print everything out and then mail it

1408311 we try to facilitate those relationships so the industry runs more smoothly and deals get done more quickly
1408312 it takes peoples resumes and breaks them down in an easier to read manner
1408313 eventually well make it more consumer friendly so that consumers can search for professionals and get a better sense of those professionals track records
1408314 for example homeowners and homebuyers will be able to see what kind of transactions or projects the professionals have done and perhaps even check references

1408333 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1408334 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
1408335 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1408336 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
1408337 when i envision the future of robots i always think of the jetsons
1408338 george jetson never sat down at a computer to task rosie to clean the house somehow they had this local exchange of information so what weve been working on is how we can use the local environment rather than a computer as a tasking medium to the robot
1408339 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us
1408340 but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention

1408344 teddy recommended specifically getting a group of doctors together from different places and different approaches and get them all on a call so that you can force different theories to be tested by the others who are there

1408346 tend to editorialize and pick out what they want to be the answer and many of us may not agree with their interpretation
1408347 is an important factor in terms of their expectations and concerns
1408348 i can see a white ball on a scan and say yes that is a tumor i agree beyond that it is rather difficult to come up with a treatment plan based on that other than saying yes i would operate or i wont
1408349 it is human nature for patients in saying they want to save their lives say i am willing to lose my speech or be completely paralyzed
1408350 because patients paralyzed after surgery are miserable and also everybody around them is miserable
1408351 while that may not be a huge amount of time one eightieth of her lifetime it is a lot of time to say and do many things when people look at it in that context it becomes a big and significant piece of time

1408361 the administration seems to have no exit strategy no contingency plans to stop the march
1408362 americas war is unjust a war fought before its time is not a just war
1408363 surely occupying powers are morally bound to think seriously about what they are going to do in someone elses country that moral test we have obviously failed to meet
1408364 a just occupation costs money it does not make money
1408365 we have much better information than the pope about whats going on inside iraq
1408366 commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states and of the militia of the several states when called into the actual service of the united states
1408367 better to slay war with words than men with swords
1408368 with whom there is no iniquity and who knows what is owing to each party in which war the people conducting armies are not to be considered as initiators of the war themselves but as his agents
1408369 it is quite unacceptable that a person should be killed for a sin he has yet to commit
1408370 if the war seems patently unjust to the subject he must not fight even if he is ordered to do so by the prince

1408390 how to speak to others without them knowing what you are talking about
1408391 there was a big problem in that adobe flash is unavailable to the masses the only way a mere mortal can do something really cool on a web site or in a presentation is to hire a flash programmer for a lot of money
1408392 they deliver the finished project to you in a form you can never edit or change youre tethered to that programmer we came to believe that that was really a big problem
1408393 with act there was a certain amount time the salesperson had to invest to get what they wanted out of it
1408394 but once they caught vision of what they wanted to do they invested the time i think the same thing will happen here this is kind of like act in the beginning where you had to convince people that yeah you can do it every product has its market mountain to climb thats part of the fun of it

1408396 dont let them know that youre ready to buy without being very particular if youre ready say that youll buy but only under these particular conditions
1408397 when you make an offer on a car youre digging yourself into a hole
1408398 that offer will be as good as it gets theres so much today in under the radar sales incentives to dealers you dont want to limit yourself
1408399 dont tell the dealer what youre willing to pay per month this is the biggest mistake a shopper can make often the dealer will focus on a monthly payment scheme insisting you are receiving a great deal but at the end of the day you wont really know what you paid advises gentile

1408408 gentili telespettatori vi stato raccontato che nelle altre democrazie il premier coperto da immunit bene siamo lieti di informarvi che non vero limmunit ce lha solo il nostro
1408409 sono fiero di appartenere a uno stato in cui un premier pu essere investigato come un semplice cittadino un premier non pu essere al di sopra della legge ma nemmeno al di sotto se devo scegliere fra me la consapevolezza di essere innocente e il fatto che restando al mio posto possa mettere in grave imbarazzo il paese che amo e che ho lonore di rappresentare non ho dubbi mi faccio da parte perch anche il primo ministro devessere giudicato come gli altri dimostrer che le accuse di corruzione sono infondate da cittadino qualunque errori ne ho commessi e me ne pento per la carica che occupo ero consapevole di poter finire al centro di attacchi feroci ma nel mio caso si passata la misura
1408410 la stampa israeliana terribile quando ha un pezzo di carne tra i denti difficile che lo molli neppure se si chiama olmert maariv e yedioth ahronot hanno pubblicato le deposizioni del premier parola per parola verbali devastanti per olmert dalla procura spiegano che le prove acquisite vanno ben oltre la testimonianza di talansky olmert dovr testimoniare per la quarta volta

1408429 the actual person teaching makes a difference in how students learn when there is a good relationship that really facilitates learning and motivation and we found that in almost every area the regular classroom teachers were more effective they were better
1408430 the relationship between the teacher and the student particularly during adolescence is very important it was easier for the kids to talk about personal stuff with someone they knew it was easier for them to absorb the material and become more interested in what they were talking about with their regular teacher in the classroom
1408431 when you have kids who simply memorize material for the test and two weeks later dont remember any of it youre not getting anywhere but if you can get the kids to care and learn because they think its important thats something that will last a lifetime
1408432 students who had a sexual partner were more likely to say that there was class discussion going on with the regular teacher than those taught by the outside person these kids were more likely to feel like there was discussion of these issues rather than just the teacher lecturing to them
1408433 school is the absolute best way to get information out to adolescents no matter who is teaching the important thing is getting the teacher to make a connection if the teacher can make the right connection with one kid youve saved one person from getting hiv youve saved one persons life

1408442 is he happy with the governments commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions if so why
1408443 does she expect proposed vehicle exhaust emissions standards to reduce the number of premature deaths from air pollution from vehicle exhausts if so how many lives does she expect this rule change could save
1408444 plain and simple my generation loves obama he gets us he trusts us treats us as equals and shares a lot of our values
1408445 when it comes to a candidate and how we expect to be treated we just want a little respect
1408446 the first and most obvious thing is just for every down ballot dem to tie themselves not just to obama himself but also to change and bringing about a new way of doing things but everyone knows this already
1408447 the second thing is for obama to make more mention of how he represents a party and make the movement based around that
1408448 it comes in two parts first and most importantly convincing people that democrats will bring change the second and by far easiest is convincing people that the republicans are to blame for how bad things are
1408449 obama should take a big part in this but its his surrogates that really need to take the lead in convincing people that more democrats more better change and that all republicans the same corrupt wrong way that is ruining america
1408450 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him
1408451 therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear is not life more important than food and the body more important than clothes
1408452 and why do you worry about clothes see how the lilies of the field grow they do not labor or spin
1408453 yea sure i must be awfully cute covered in vomit
1408454 it was a pleasure meeting you hope we meet again soon

1408489 while the article mentions the usual whipping boys from videogames manhunt grand theft auto its actually a pretty reasonable piece of writing urging christians to understand the games their children are playing and even highlighting some games as positive or at least not harmful
1408490 parents should place limits on childrens media use including when where and how much they can participate and we should be ready to address common myths that are often portrayed in the media such as the myths that to be worthwhile you have to be beautiful that money buys happiness that sex is merely recreation and has no consequences and that violence solves problems

1408503 yet you assert 1 and 3 are clearly designed but the increasingly complex 5 and 7 are not designed you use the a priori assumption that there is no designer for life therefore those things were not designed circular logic

1408515 when we talk about a financial crisis its really only a symptom financial adventurism is essentially what we have been witnessing for the last thirty or forty years exploding from time to time in the form of financial crisis its really adventurist speculative capital which has to find in some way a solution to itself and why is that that is the question it is basically because of overproduced productive capital productive capital investment is in profound crisis thats why so much is diverted into the channels of the speculative and adventurist speculative type of transactions now the other crisis is a political crisis
1408516 it is roughly around 68 when we can begin to mark what is really the structural crisis not of capitalism but of the capital system in its entirety the capital system is much more fundamental than capitalism what we are therefore concerned with is a crisis which can only deepen now dont misunderstand me when i say we dont have a usual capitalist crisis because capitalism and crisis are synonymous marx said that many times but he was talking about a very different crisis he was talking about conjunctural cyclic crises capitalism regularly has crises marx even used the expression these crises discharge themselves in a thunderstorm then you are back to normal so to speak a lot of surplus capital is destroyed and you can start the game all over again until again you reach a point of overaccumulation then a new discharge becomes necessary thats what we have been living through now our great privilege if you like is that we have both we have both the cyclic conjunctural crisis and this profound and ever deepening structural crisis of the whole system the whole capital system because the soviet union was part of the capital system

1408524 from 2003 through 2007 the countrys major insurance companies saw their profits grow from 4 7 billion to 12 6 billion
1408525 moreover many insurers in the states saw their profits grow without a corresponding increase in the number of members covered

1408536 replace the religious catechism by something else even if it be a scientific one
1408537 youre reducing scientific thought to the level of religious catechism in an attempt to set one off against the other but even you must see this is just a semantic exercise on your part science isnt a religion and it certainly isnt treated as one by scientists
1408538 there are a great many scientists who will never allow for the theory of purely naturalistic evolution to be challenged or overthrown it goes against their fundamental worldview
1408539 they are inseperable atheism and science in general most people when they get training in the scientific method find themselves questioning religion a lot more im pushing at the edges i think of myself as more representative of people who havent had a long voice in this country for a long time i think we are getting new recruits i get compliments all the time ive gotten a number of conversion stories to atheism we are not going to convert the diehard christians but i think there is a much larger population of people in this country who have a casual religion those people we can reach theres that huge middle ground we are fighting over yeah i think we can gain recruits from there were not trying to spread our faith were trying to spread critical thinking we want people to be converted to that great big house of skepticism and inquiry the argument that we sound like evangelical christians is bad i think is incorrect we do want to get out there and spread our ideas and we do want to speak our ideas loudly i came to atheism through science i dont see how anyone can find the book of genesis satisfying it says god did it seven times and nothing more ken miller is a great guy but hes religious hes immediately biasing the argument whats happening is conservative churchs are forcefeeding children nonsense the professor is not forcefeeding atheism

1408542 in my opinion we have to go with the best knowledge we have available and that is that things of a certain level of specific or functional complexity are designed we know that to be true
1408543 we dont know we have no evidence science doesnt speak to those issues

1408547 what is your evidence of molecules to man naturalistic evolution

1408550 if an organism could be found which i could not imagine coming about in a gradual sequence of events then my theory would absolutely break down

1408605 our corporate office recently approved to further invest in building an additional two floors on the existing building to make it a four storey facility
1408606 this further expansion indicates knowles confidence in malaysia as one of the main manufacturing operating centres for our highly refined miniature tranducers microphones
1408607 in the event of any massive layoffs we hope to rehabilitate the affected workers via the entry of either fresh investments or expansion plans announced by existing investors
1408608 trade however will be affected especially in the local electrical and electronics industry with impact on employment
1408609 our company is a start up company we have been around for more than a year and so far have sold little as our focus has been on product development
1408610 but we are confident of generating a revenue of more than euro100 million within five years based on our innovative technology
1408611 you can call our technology disruptive technology as i am convinced it will replace currently dominant technologies such as epoxy floors for high performance industrial flooring thats because our material is as good as epoxy but better in terms of environment health safety and far cheaper to manufacture
1408612 we are currently in talks with several major companies that want to license our technology talks are still in early stages we hope something will materialise sometime next year
1408613 as is to be expected the wide and varied effects of the weakening in crude oil include their impact on the commodities market within and outside malaysia

1408616 although we want to reduce manpower in the short term to manage our cost as we are similarly affected by the fuel price our approach is different as we will grow in the medium to long term
1408617 however our top priority is to ensure business continuity and there will be no compromise on safety quality of our services and offerings as such while eligible employees can apply for these two programmes the final decision lies with the company

1408678 i use cloth napkins instead of paper in my house the napkin stays at the family members place at the table after each meal the napkin will go back in the ring until its next use when the linens get dirty once or twice a week i change them its like redecorating in a minutes time
1408679 you may think that tablecloths and napkins are not appropriate for your current lifestyle on the contrary i have used cloth linens since the day i was married then had two small messy eaters and now dine with a couple of voracious teenage boys the solution is clear plastic placemats over the cloth placemats when feeding toddlers whether in fashion or dressing your table theres no need to forgo style when living with young children
1408680 as a mother of two sons and the daughter in law of a woman who wrote an etiquette book i feel it my duty to teach my sons the proper use of cloth table linens and to not be intimidated by them equally important i have taught them to set a proper table just like jewelry and shoes dishes and napkin rings are the accessories for the table that complete the look you are trying to convey
1408681 i want to present my home in the best light possible just like the perfect outfit can make a great first impression table linens can make your family and guests feel like you were expecting them and their presence makes every day a special occasion

1408714 as the union has styled its correspondence as an appeal we will not comment while this matter is pending
1408715 ultimately the question of determining whether the applicant is who he she claims to be is a value judgment and the question of determining if enough identifying evidence has been submitted is a matter involving government discretion
1408716 the job does not just involve recording the identification giving an oath and taking the applicants money
1408717 the decision to issue a passport is inherently a function to be exercised by the government
1408718 however the process of granting and issuing passports and the process accepting and executing passport applications from american citizens are two separate and distinct processes

1408743 some pieces of the chandeliers on the ballroom fell some people freaked out others kept typing some got under their desks most myself included sat and stared they did not stop the test or give us extra time even though we all lost about 5 minutes except the crazy gunners who kept typing
1408744 it was a scary one felt it pretty strong here in century city los angeles struck towards the end of the third question on the morning part of the bar exam most people actually stopped typing for a minute and werent sure what to do but the earthquake was reasonably short maybe 10 seconds or so the bar exam is in the basement of hyatt hotel there is no way to get out even if you tried it took a good 20 minutes to leave after the morning session was over one of the elevators stopped working too we were told that it needs to be reprogrammed overall not a big deal and thankfully it was towards the end when most folks were done with their bar exam answers anyway
1408745 the head proctor instructed all to stay seated and calm the quake shook the sub ground hall its concrete pillars hanging lights and metal ceiling grid above but nothing seemed to have fallen it sounded like a freight train lasted only 10 15 seconds and happened with about 12 minutes remaining to the morning portion no extra time was given on the exam

1408747 am i about to get sick i dont ever get that stressed this is new
1408748 pardon my incoherence henceforth because we just had an earthquake
1408749 so i heard that one year there was an earthquake during the bar
1408750 i survived the 5 7 earthquake that made us all duck under the tables but you would not believe how many people popped right back up and kept typing like nothing happened not to mention the handful that never went under the table also notable the people that took their computers with them under the table
1408751 as long as the ceiling doesnt fall on me while im taking the exam things will be great
1408752 the state bar is gathering data on the disruption that along with reports from experts in psychometrics will be presented to the committee of bar examiners in order to measure the earthquakes possible impact on test scores
1408753 while it was momentarily unnerving ive not heard that there was a significant disruption you cant treat sally different than johnny just because one person felt the earthquake more than others
1408754 it unnerved the test takers right there at that moment
1408755 my guess is that it really didnt have a material impact

1408791 never seek to constrain their uk military commanders ability to make decisions
1408792 britain would release around 60 militia prisoners and stop patrolling inside the city in return the mehdi army agreed not to attack the british as they withdrew to the airport
1408793 lives were saved but basra was effectively abandoned now questions are being asked about just how far this deal tied british commanders hands during this years battle for basra
1408794 no secret deal or accommodation with the militias kept us out of the city nor were they waiting on the permission of des browne the defence secretary
1408795 when prime minister maliki launched operation charge of the knights in basra on 24 march british forces provided the assistance that the iraqi authorities sought from us including armour artillery airpower medical and logistic support
1408796 the only limit placed on the profile of our support was mr malikis rightful concern that the iraqi security forces be seen by the people of basrah to be those enforcing the rule of law in the city
1408797 it is true that as general petraeus described very clearly last september and again this april the coalition forces have been very actively supporting the iraqi governments efforts to seek reconciliation with insurgent elements british forces have played a significant role in this regard
1408798 in basrah we have always been prepared to talk to anyone who wishes to renounce violence and participate in the democratic process in iraq including the militias
1408799 in no sense did this act as an inhibition on supporting the legitimate iraqi security forces in their exercise of the rule of law in the city
1408800 had no bearing on the decision to go to the city
1408801 we negotiate with all sorts of groups anyone who is willing to engage with the political process and reconciliation to move the thing forward
1408802 exactly under what circumstances the negotiations took place and whether or not they tied the hands of the british army
1408803 what would be unacceptable is if our troops were under effective political orders not to take risks because potential loss of life would be politically unacceptable
1408804 when the iraqi army needed help our forces shouldve been free to give that help as required
1408805 its fair to say weve not been given the full picture how much of the story in the newspapers is true i now wait to see
1408806 the allegations made in the times article are simply not true there was no deal never mind a deal preventing the uk military from entering basra
1408807 this has been made clear in a letter to the times by air vice chief marshall chris nickols
1408808 i have the greatest confidence in the judgement of uk military commanders in iraq and i would never seek to constrain their ability to make decisions

1408849 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work
1408850 and i truly understand that if i was in mikes shoes id see it basically the same way he sees it im sure and i think if he was in my shoes hed see it my way i think we both agree on that
1408851 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it

1408888 i dont know who these attackers are i think they come from the countryside but all i know is that its bad for me it scares away the foreign tourists
1408889 its a big agenda but look what weve done here
1408890 im very excited about this new job its a great opportunity for me
1408891 we try to do it as close to the recording as we can
1408892 thats one of the reasons we called ourselves riff bandits we were stealing other peoples riffs and sound
1408893 we tend to stick with what works bad company beatles stones u2 the cars billy idol
1408894 we barely rehearse we just seem to connect on stage we can just look at each other and know when a song is going to end
1408895 he can suit his voice to whatever were playing he can do the low tones of johnny cash or do neil diamond or the hip
1408896 he can hold his own on guitar and hell do harmonica on mustang sally or cocaine
1408897 that puts kind of a spin on things go see a blues band sure you have a harmonica player but not in cover bands its kind of nice
1408898 its mainly bluesy rock im into hendrix the pentatonic scales nothing too fancy
1408899 im a left handed player so he has always been an idol to me there arent too many lefties out there i like the way he plays that strat sound
1408900 the dog must have weighed at least 120 pounds it was unleashed and it wasnt wearing a collar
1408901 i fled into the schoolyard to get away and the dog chased and proceeded to attack me
1408902 i cant believe thats all he was charged with he and his companion tried to flee the scene
1408903 also they went with this vicious animal into a schoolyard where there couldve been children playing
1408904 with the click of a mouse scientists government officials and land managers will be able to see the changes in the earths landscape at any point in the past three and a half decades
1408905 it will open up new avenues for geographic understanding around the globe it represents the democratization of digital data and empowers people everywhere with rich information

1408907 the plan we adopt today will be the federal governments primary road map for federal efforts to prevent and control invasive species over the next five years
1408908 its significance cannot be overstated because invasive species cause great damage to the nations environment economy and human health harming fisheries forests croplands and natural areas impairing recreation and endangering public health through threats like west nile virus
1408909 by using cooperative and well coordinated approaches nisc and our partners are making real progress
1408910 since its formation in1999 by executive order 13112 nisc and our partners have developed much greater knowledge and public awareness of invasive species nisc agencies have developed new tools and methods to prevent and control them
1408911 best thing for this team is for us to part ways
1408912 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner roger goodell reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1408913 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work
1408914 and i truly understand that if i was in mikes shoes id see it basically the same way he sees it im sure and i think if he was in my shoes hed see it my way i think we both agree on that
1408915 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1408916 my message to democratic lawmakers is this if youre really for increased american energy production then prove it by putting it in writing sign the discharge petitions house republicans are circulating that will force votes on energy legislation speaker pelosi refuses to bring to the floor and sign onto the american energy act our all of the above plan to increase conservation innovation and american energy production instead of doing the speakers bidding by voting against bringing it to a vote if you arent willing to put it in writing youre fooling no one youre siding with the speaker of the drill nothing congress and radical special interests that favor higher gas prices at the expense of energy strapped american families
1408917 the office is relatively young and upbeat its really fun people get along really well theres a good dynamic and everyone is very close to each other
1408918 most offers are looked at in the middle of the week usually im in the field presenting them
1408919 but i always come in on monday and wednesday because we get free lunch
1408920 when theres a house that has multiple offers ill be the one that handles that first
1408921 the agents who succeed do care i tend to be a happy person laid back with a calm demeanor a salesperson doesnt always listen i spend a good amount of time to listen and approach it in that manner
1408922 personally since my area is where there are multiple offers the challenge is making the phone call to tell them they didnt get the house even though they really wanted it and they went 100 000 over the asking price actually making the call and convincing the customer that we did the best we could
1408923 the industry needs to keep up with that it needs to catch up with technology it hasnt changed much in the last 50 years
1408924 growing up my parents used to take me to open houses
1408925 i grew up around houses so i thought id enjoy it i got my license and i do enjoy it
1408926 redfin is more on the innovative side of technology where 10 years ago the internet wasnt a big part of the industry
1408927 most of our clients are similar because they are tech savvy and compelled for that reason
1408928 were doing something people have tried to do but were doing it the right way
1408929 the goal is to take care of the customer educate and work in partnership to a happy goal for everybody
1408930 did i sound like i knew what i was talking about
1408931 originally we planned to open both in 2006 but we realized later that building two stores so close together was a little overambitious for us
1408932 while our location has changed we have never wavered on our commitment and vision for a second lunds in the downtown area
1408933 there is a tremendous need for a full service supermarket in downtown minneapolis
1408934 motorola is the pioneer in mobile devices and i am honored to become co ceo of this company and ceo of the mobile devices business i welcome the opportunity to lead this company into the future while working to create a successful independent mobile devices company that will continue to innovate and grow for years to come i look forward to working closely with greg the board the senior leadership team and motorolas talented hard working and dedicated associates around the globe to build value for our stockholders
1408935 certainly i have sent a signal to both sides of where im headed
1408936 there is a time for putting together and another time for taking apart
1408937 kosovars used to identify with the palestinians because we albanians are muslims and christians and we saw serbia and israel both as usurpers of land
1408938 then we looked at a map and woke up israelis have a population of six million their backs to the sea and 300 million arab enemies albanians have a total population of eight million our backs to the sea and 200 million slav enemies so why should we identify with the arabs
1408939 these swamp environments are extremely difficult to get along in
1408940 theres literally no place to pitch a tent and sleep
1408941 the mortal kombat people and the dc people were like no no you cant do that those guys dont meet theyre in different dimensions blah blah blah

1408944 the return has gone very well theres a lot of enthusiasm and they guys are happy to see each other though the holidays were a bit short
1408945 we started our physical training in july the players are very enthusiastic weve got a group of players coming back from injury that are very motivated like florian fritz and celement poitrenaud
1408946 they pull the whole groups level up while some get lethargic others are there to take their place its a challenge for us to manage the this group with regards to individualising physical preparation with the season finishing so late
1408947 were used to it though every year its the same except for last year because of the world cup when you make the final or semi final of competitions the seasons get very long
1408948 our foreign players had an extra week of holidays i think theyre in good condition the group is going to be composed of a number of quality players
1408949 our motivation is the same as always we want to win as many games as possible we dont need to explain that to the players thats what they are here for were just here to help them work since weve got the bouclier de brennus well do everything possible to defend it if we didnt have it we would have done all that we could to win it
1408950 new players will join the team all of whom are no strangers to the
1408951 despite all our injuries last season we managed to win the title with
1408952 if theyre good theres no reason why we shouldnt play them

1409020 i still dont agree with how he spoke to housemates when we were picking head of house and he snapped and started kicking off with people
1409021 stuarts been hinting to everyone in the house that he wants to go home and i do feel its sort of like hes been putting pressure on all of us to nominate him and to me he shouldnt be doing that
1409022 he doesnt really join in much with the group discussions and he goes to bed early pretty much every night he doesnt really contribute that much compared with everyone else

1409029 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1409030 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time this is more than about an open competition and i can do that absolutely but this is going to be mass confusion and thats not good for this team
1409031 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work
1409032 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it

1409052 i found the pursuer to be a generally unsatisfactory witness he was self pitying and discursive and tended to make excuses for himself

1409060 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1409061 and what decent business doesnt let someone try and get their old job back
1409062 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1409063 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time this is more than about an open competition and i can do that absolutely but this is going to be mass confusion and thats not good for this team

1409065 i believe mike mccarthy thinks brett favre has lost his edge
1409066 mccarthy said favres answers would go a long way toward formulating the teams approach to its quarterback position this season
1409067 mccarthy is an idiot thompson is a bigger idiot murphy is the biggest idiot
1409068 favre wants out time for tt to show his true grit will he fold and trade him to the queens whatever the case goodel should now stay out 4 is reinstated and the decision is all the packers as to what they do with him they own his rights if they are willing to deal with the hellstorm that would result from favre being the backup then so be it it would be better than seeing him in purple
1409069 i will start or play against you with someone in the division

1409074 in urmatoarele doua luni am putea asista la o ieftinire a petrolului la 100 dolari baril daca se mentine ritmul actual de scadere a preturilor
1409075 daca nu vor fi probleme cu uraganele sau in orientul mijlociu cred ca vom asista in continuare la o ieftinire a petrolului
1409076 cred ca este posibil ca in urmatoarele doua luni sa asistam la o ieftinire a petrolului sub 100 dolari baril in conditiile in care pretul petrolului a coborat cu aproape 30 dolari pana acum asa ca e nevoie sa mai scada cu numai 18 dolari

1409142 infinite atonement that will suffice for the sins of the world
1409143 other scriptures could be cited in opposition to the divine infusion theory
1409144 that we cannot abandon penal substitution because it is taught explicitly in the scriptures
1409145 we know that it is unjust to punish one person for another persons sins which is why the atonement had to be worked out on an entirely different principle altogether
1409146 means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance
1409147 prove that the book of mormon argues against penal substitution

1409163 one thing we do is take breaks during practice that is all you can do we tell them to hydrate in between drills and hydrate when you arent participating in a drill thats part of camp usually you have more guys go down than we have so im excited about that
1409164 they are better conditioned and we have a lot of young guys so we need to get more reps that is the one thing we are really doing getting a lot of reps in when you have one practice a day it makes it easier you get your work in and then you go in and rest the rest of the day those guys like it when they are always getting reps and nobody is standing around

1409168 the goal is to assess every child who comes into the foster care system and provide whatever mental health treatment that is needed early before the trauma from abuse and neglect causes more problems to emerge
1409169 these services will improve the quality of life in the community overall and they offer hope and affirm recovery is possible
1409170 number one i think its important to have an external set of eyes
1409171 number two i think that this is an issue also about the community and i think we wanted some individuals who have the confidence of the community certainly former sheriff ramirez and current chief moore have a tremendous amount of expertise in running secure facilities as well as being aware of community standards and how the hospital fits into the community
1409172 i think its a great combination a great team on paper
1409173 hopefully they can really come in and tell us what we need to do now
1409174 when i go out there and visit that place last week again i just shake my head
1409175 its just so old its in very bad shape and we really need a new facility my biggest concern is that we stay on time that we get it built when we said we were going to get it built
1409176 im sure everyone has the same question what did you do with
1409177 i just cant imagine someone spending all that money theres a lot of information that needs to come out
1409178 i feel like park just took my money and just got one of the best criminal defense attorneys in town siriyutwatana said
1409179 clearly he does not have enough money from his own abilities to support himself and simultaneously pay any support its just not there

1409188 major depressive disorder is a condition characterized by one or more major depressive episodes without a history of manic mixed or hypomanic episodes individuals with this disorder have more pain and physical illness and decreased physical social and role functioning
1409189 this disorder also increases risk of also having panic disorder obsessive compulsive disorder anorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa and emotionally unstable borderline personality disorder
1409190 i am confident that our work to resolve these issues will satisfy the concern expressed by the department of justice
1409191 i have no problem in telling family members that their loved ones are safe
1409192 i can tell you this report is one year old we have made the corrections
1409193 our review of the investigations involving completed suicides and suicide attempts revealed the jails failure to respond adequately to issues that could help mitigate the success of these activities
1409194 while the jail does have an investigatory process that process is often inadequate to prevent an adequate understanding of the causes leading to an event or to implement measures to prevent future similar events the jail lacks a formal process for reviewing even detainee deaths for operational breakdowns
1409195 we uncovered instances where detainees were not provided adequate access to medical care specifically acute services with dire results
1409196 in our experts opinion this womans care was unconscionable during the hours she was in critical need of access to medical care
1409197 other than medicating detainees with thorazine which is an older anti psychotic medication with serious potential side effects the jail offers essentially no mental health services to its seriously mentally ill
1409198 detainees have no soap in the cells to wash their hands further the toilet and drinking faucets are small units with the faucet and basin just above the uncovered foul smelling filthy commode stool if a detainee needs water the detainee has to cup his hand under the faucet and lap water from his hands close above the filth of the toilet bowl
1409199 fire safety is a grave concern for this jail we found serious problems with fire safety training policies and safety equipment both staff and detainees are in serious jeopardy of injury or death during a fire emergency
1409200 actual direct supervision of detainees at the jail is virtually non existent frequent fights or altercations which occur in the cell areas are often the result of inadequate housing unit supervision by jail staff
1409201 there is an inordinately high risk of detainee on detainee violence at the jail as a result of the jails chronic overcrowding the staffs inability to supervise detainees and the ability of detainees to bypass at will the security of their cell doors
1409202 jail staff frequently resort to use of force to control events although such uses of force are not per se inappropriate between january 2006 and march 2007 there were 1 337 reported use of force incidents in the opinion of our expert this is an inordinately high number of use of force incidents for a facility the size of the jail
1409203 the images range from a wind whipped tree leaning over a snowy field to a close up of a soft sheep snout
1409204 the cheapest food possible without even considering whether its good for you
1409205 we debated for a long time whether to go to two miles and that would have affected about 8 000 children
1409206 i think it is time we have to look at putting our resources in the classroom

1409208 so the other guy is getting an opportunity to play and hes doing a good job with it
1409209 moneys good moneys a necessity but its not everything i cant put a price tag on my mental state
1409210 ceramic complexity is too great to be subsumed in a single typological system such as type variety
1409211 we believe that the hopes of creating a single unitary system of ceramic classification based on the type variety system are doomed to failure
1409212 the importance of both analytic and taxonomic classification in the type variety system

1409218 there are hundreds of people that should be in that stone with us all the way from friends and family to mangers and guys in the band
1409219 because theres no political pressure to adjudicate nobody does it because in an adjudication somebody wins and somebody loses when the judge has to make a decision somebodys happy and somebodys really unhappy and in politics we dont want to make anyone unhappy so we dont adjudicate
1409220 if those prices remain steady new mexicos surplus revenue which is largely dependent on oil and natural gas royalties would end up being closer to 10 million than the 392 million that had been projected in july
1409221 we think we got involved in iraq due to lies we think weve continued to be there because of lies and it really troubles us that the city would put a put up a monument that would make that connection

1409237 unfortunately thats the kind of pattern that involves an employee doing this
1409238 the way it is described here with that kind of rage he had already lost it

1409240 contrary to popular belief the vast majority of them are not
1409241 it is thought out and planned in their minds in a very rational and logical manner and in the moment they do it they might be at some level of mental instability but youre generally talking about someone who is a logical and rational person not someone who is insane
1409242 it could be as simple as sitting down and talking to the person finding out whats wrong and seeing if they can help them deal with that
1409243 the biggest problem is people in denial of whats going on around them at work

1409264 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity

1409277 many iwi organisations protested the sanctioned use of mechanical devices to harvest kaimoana because they deplete the resources of mussel spat too quickly and harm tuatua and toheroa beds
1409278 in recent weeks mussel spat gatherers have been seen blatantly driving their tractors and trucks into the sea over tuatua beds without any respect for the hapu in ahipara who have been nurturing and protecting these resources for everybody and every generation since the great migration
1409279 all iwi organisations need to call for an immediate review of this process which allows mechanical harvesting of their iwi resources

1409356 we have had utility style computing data centers and hosted offerings for years now i dont see what at amp t is offering here that qualifies as anything but a utility style on demand data center offering and that is sort of what cloud computing is
1409357 i think the at amp t offering is interesting and it could be a way to bring more traditional companies into this because the companies that have been going after the cloud to begin with have been more web 2 0 cutting edge companies maybe an old time vendor like at amp t is the way to bring a broader commercial audience into what people are calling the cloud
1409358 the key advantage to at amp ts service is that it controls not just the servers and the cloud but it also owns the network that those bits of data must traverse to get from the cloud to your computer
1409359 thats a powerful proposition because it gives at amp t one more potential point of failure that it can guarantee and control it also could lead the way for some interesting pricing options given that at amp t will know exactly how much it costs for each byte of storage and each compute cycle but it also has the wholesale costs of bandwidth

1409611 first is sheer ignorance ignorance of critical facts about important events in the news and ignorance of how our government functions and whos in charge second is negligence the disinclination to seek reliable sources of information about important news events third is wooden headedness the inclination to believe what we want to believe regardless of the facts fourth is shortsightedness the support of public policies that are mutually contradictory or contrary to the countrys long term interests fifth and finally is a broad category i call bone headedness the susceptibility to meaningless phrases stereotypes irrational biases and simplistic diagnoses and solutions that play on our hopes and fears

1409617 only 34 know that it is the congress that declares war which may explain why they are not alarmed when presidents take us into wars without explicit declarations of war from the legislature only 35 know that congress can override a presidential veto some 49 think the president can suspend the constitution some 60 believe that he can appoint judges to the federal courts without the approval of the senate some 45 believe that revolutionary speech is punishable under the constitution

1409741 nous navons pas encore pris connaissance de ce rapport qui ne nous a pas t communiqu par le gouvernement rwandais et nous ne sommes donc pas en mesure dy r agir
1409742 ce rapport nest pas un dossier criminel cest une bonne base pour d ventuelles proc dures l gales
1409743 des agissements dune association dont le mot dordre est de br ler les centres de r tention financ s par le contribuable
1409744 si je saisis la justice cest sur la base dune d claration publique faite dans un grand quotidien
1409745 notre mot dordre cest de br ler les centres on assume puisque cest de la l gitime d fense en r ponse la violence des autorit s qui enferment des gens qui nont rien fait

1409747 it just means i dont have to go as much last year we had the problem where we only had like four quarterbacks and 10 running backs to work with and now weve got eight quarterbacks shifting in
1409748 its been a long time coming and like i told the team this morning ive been waiting for this for a year now im tired of sitting on the sidelines and im ready to go
1409749 you can already tell that its going to be a great game day experience just with us yelling and screaming and hooting and hollering gave us some noise issues
1409750 and thats going to help us with some of the places well be playing on the road and it just feels a heck of a lot more like college football when youve got both sides of the stadium
1409751 porque yo ya estoy para ser sacrificado y el tiempo de mi partida est cercano he peleado la buena batalla he acabado la carrera he guardado la fe por lo dem s me est guardada la corona de justicia la cual me dar el se or juez justo en aquel d a y no s lo a mi sino tambi n a todos los que aman su venida

1409755 ein araber hoch und wei kam an mir vor ber er hatte die kamele versorgt und ging zum schlafplatz
1409756 kelsey grammer is out of the hospital feeling great and about to resume normal activities at home he and his wife camille want to thank everyone who expressed concern they appreciated the kind words
1409757 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues its very disturbing to see this
1409758 morgan is doing well after his surgery last night monday to reconnect nerves and repair damage in his left arm and hand the surgery last night lasted four and a half hours hes visiting with family this morning as of this morning hes up and walking around and looking forward to his release in a few days
1409759 she and z pick out their clothes and help change and hold them
1409760 this is mad s fourth fifth time becoming an older bro hes asking us when we can have more
1409761 i knew they would be premature so when i saw they were big and screaming with healthy lungs i was at peace
1409762 viv is proving to resemble ange in spirit attitude and physicality
1409763 the name vivienne came to us early as if she named herself she has always been viv and marcheline is to honor angies mother
1409764 knox came soon after it is a family name my grandfathers l on is a classic french name
1409765 i bought the rights to her life story so she couldnt write a book i seen her being ridiculous i knew her capabilities of going in that direction so i bought the rights
1409766 in reflection of how critical it has become for the us military to retain native language and cultural know how in its ranks
1409767 i think we have two choices i think he obama should win and ithink he will win
1409768 talking about theconstitutional qualifications of barack obama rather than sort of making achoice between obama and
1409769 donate 2 percent of their profits for the last four quarters to a fund that would help struggling americans pay their heating bills
1409770 probably adequate to help with most of the problem that we face this fall
1409771 the letter handed over is not an answer to the offered package the letter does not mention the freeze for freeze issue
1409772 if we dont receive a clear message from them we will have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1409773 during the call jalili expressed his readiness to start formal talks
1409774 they have a very weak economy at this point which depends almost entirely on their oil revenue
1409775 the season gets better every year and this one has a really good feeling about it among guests and staff
1409776 were having a great season good coverage and everythings open and that happened really early on
1409777 its been a funny season in terms of the snow levels in that were not getting the big dumps but the good thing about coronet peak is we dont need it
1409778 the investment in the snow guns made a difference and weve been using them whenever the conditions are right at least two or three times per week
1409779 weve put a lot of time and money into the mountain the snows been excellent the snow guns are performing and the base building has worked really well
1409780 we want to say a big thank you to everyone who has come up and enjoyed the snow its good to see so many people having fun and feedback from clients and friends whove been skiing here for 50 years or more has been outstanding
1409781 were enjoying the snow always looking for more skiing and riding is all good
1409782 we had a chap from mt whistler skiing on the south face and he said it was the best hed done in 25 years he did 80 turns in ankle deep powder
1409783 were having bigger days when were open but more closed days than last year
1409784 its an odd situation nzx regulation is lifting the suspension even though the annual report has not been filed
1409785 it is either breaking one of its own rules or decided that after discussions with dominion enough progress has been made to allow people the option of trading the securities
1409786 it was difficult to predict what price dominion shares would open at today he said
1409787 dfh shareholders are precluded from doing so while dfh securities are suspended from trading in this case nzx regulation believes shareholders interests are best served by enabling them to deal with their holdings if they wish to do so
1409788 our position in the market must never disappoint the consumer in terms of quality of offering
1409789 while possibly more fractured rock could again be found in this area near the fault the most difficult mining challenge is over and tunnel advance rates are expected to improve significantly
1409790 growth is expected to pick up in the december 2008 quarter owing to the combined effects of tax cuts on october 1 2008 recovery from the drought high export prices the weakening new zealand dollar and more reductions in the official cash rate
1409791 businesses have also indicated generally they are not looking to increase part time or full time staff levels this is a significant turn around from six months ago when there was still demand for more staff
1409792 since 2000 new zealand has experienced the longest period of economic growth since world war ii
1409793 but even after that strong growth and having achieved one of the worlds lowest unemployment rates we cannot expect to be immune from a serious global financial storm
1409794 but for them to remain so business expectations will now need to start pushing higher in light of falling petrol prices the drop in interest rates and the exchange rate and upcoming tax cuts this is certainly plausible
1409795 what all this means is that its business that takes more than its share of the pricing pain via a decline in profits as opposed to households through paying increased selling prices
1409796 we were pretty much at the end of the line
1409797 its not a holiday its extremely disciplined he mr hardinge has them punching a bag for a long time glen gets alongside them while they are punching and they talk hes not talking at them they talk to him
1409798 we understand the 2009 full year earnings guidance provided at the april briefing day was based on a top down view and we may get an update based on four further months of trading in the current climate we think a positive revision would be unlikely
1409799 not all but still too many americans especially within the middle strata although not only there are in a real sense falling into acting like children easily distracted with toys here at midnight tonight the new i phone people will line up and fight each other to get in line to get the new i phone but they cant bring themselves to mobilize against the torture and the wars and everything else that is being done by their government in their name and right before their eyes this is not even really being hidden
1409800 i want to say just for the record that at times i myself have been acutely disappointed by and yes have cursed in graphic terms the people in this society who are sitting by and doing nothing in the face of atrocities and horrors committed by their government and in their name
1409801 as for people who are politically backward communists should not slight or despise them but should befriend them unite with them convince them and encourage them to go forward
1409802 a communist must never be opinionated or domineering thinking that he is good in everything while others are good in nothing he must never shut himself up in his little room or brag and boast and lord it over others
1409803 the politics of the possible is the politics of monstrosity to adhere to or acquiesce in the politics of the possible is to support and actually to facilitate monstrosity
1409804 maoists and iphones embrace new tech or blame the people
1409805 but this verdict conflates mushes and confuses two things the willingness of the masses to act and their willingness to act along specific lines demanded by this small political group for communists to confuse these things is to lose the mass line completely
1409806 but if the likes of the rcp goes into the community suddenly without having any ties without really being involved in the struggles that people are waging i think this has more to do with them the rcp not having hegemony over those struggles and they would have to contend with different forces and lines
1409807 stop thinking youre the awesome shit and get down with people all people to try to figure out what is really going on and to figure the best way to unite with them and draw them forward politically
1409808 get the crap off your iphone and get in this protest
1409809 to be an apostle is something great but to be outstanding among the apostles just think what a wonderful song of praise that is how great the wisdom of this woman must have been that she was even deemed worthy of the title of apostle
1409810 the female sex is easily seduced weak and without much understanding the devil seeks to vomit out this disorder through women we wish to apply masculine reasoning and destroy the folly of these women
1409811 to date not a single latin or greek inscription not a single reference in ancient literature has been cited by any of the proponents of the junias hypothesis my own search for an attestation has also proved fruitless this means that we do not have a single shred of evidence that the name junias ever existed the feminine junia by contrast is a common name in both greek and latin inscriptions and literature in short literally all of the philological evidence points to the feminine junia
1409812 nonexistent within the new testament manuscripts but it does not appear even once in any ancient manuscripts sacred or secular
1409813 the most natural way to read the greek phrase is that both were apostles some modern interpreters have rejected this reading mainly because they presuppose that women could never fill this office

1409835 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
1409836 say whatever you want about bill clinton but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based
1409837 we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united states of their own party
1409838 theyre going to try to make you afraid theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black

1409845 these deployments do take a toll on the soldiers and their families
1409846 i think its a little bit tougher on the families back home because their loved ones are deployed to a combat zone
1409847 the uncertainty missing all of those special moments with your family i mean that takes a toll
1409848 the department of defense has gone all out to do the best that we can to maintain good connections between the deployed soldier and the family back home
1409849 just knowing that their loved one is ok is a great thing
1409850 personally ive taken on as a mission that every single soldier will get a ballot
1409851 whether they choose to vote or not thats their call but it will be in their hand and then they will have time to vote and i think they will
1409852 that gay individuals are entitled to the same legal rights and the same respect and dignity afforded all other individuals and are protected from discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation
1409853 sections 1 and 7 of article i of the california constitution cannot properly be interpreted to withhold from gay individuals
1409854 marriage is the foundation of the natural family and sustains family values
1409855 this years fair is different because of the catastrophic event we recently had that is still very fresh in peoples minds
1409856 we hope to give some visuals of the flooding for people who arent from eastern iowa as well as imagery and information to help people understand the universitys efforts to become less energy dependent and more effective in generating energy internally
1409857 our long term goal is to help the university and supply power in a sustainable way
1409858 it also is to show everyone else in the state how to take their local natural resources and use them to generate power as well
1409859 we are hoping to educate people on iowa archeology and what it has to offer
1409860 a lot of cultural information is lost due to progress we want to make people aware of it and help us preserve our past

1409863 at fm we love nothing more than supporting the communities that form around great content
1409864 crowdfire takes it a step further by culminating all that online activity and digital media sharing with a real world face to face collaborative creation i cant wait to dig in and see what we can all create together
1409865 crowdfire is a first of its kind fusion of digital media fan participation social networking and digital technology
1409866 our fans and concertgoers are incredibly digitally savvy but theyre also incredibly socially active they want a place to bring the two together this is the perfect synthesis of music online networking and face to face fun
1409867 for the first time ive seen iraqi security forces that can plan prepare and execute first class offensive operations
1409868 ive also seen a high level of trust and respect by the people of rashid for their own army and police forces
1409869 together we conduct relentless offensive operations designed to kill capture or drive from rashid anyone who threatens the safety and security of the people we have sworn to protect
1409870 i believe this reduction in violence is a direct result of the conditions set by the success of the surge in forces and combat power
1409871 we built on this success and have seen a dramatic reduction in violence in the past four months
1409872 emplaced by special group criminals who operate as part of the illegal militias in baghdad
1409873 i think they want to undermine the government and theyre using the neighborhoods of rashid as a battlefield
1409874 there seemed to be a wedge that was placed between the people and the insurgents and we tried to exploit that
1409875 it is my firm belief that the decisive defeat of the special group criminals and militias in may and june of this year has opened a window of opportunity for us to make substantial and lasting improvements in the rashid district
1409876 we have captured more than 170 special group criminals associated with the jaysh al mahdi militia
1409877 seizing on the improved security conditions we are pursuing reconstruction projects to improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1409878 weve also proposed an additional 117 projects valued at more than 26 million
1409879 each project is coordinated with the rashid district council leadership to ensure that we are meeting the needs of the people
1409880 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1409881 at these high injected doses we hoped to see drug like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment
1409882 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1409883 clinical and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the past 12 years showed that oral ascorbate levels in plasma and tissue are tightly controlled in the case series ascorbate was given orally and intravenously but in the trials ascorbate was just given orally it was not realized at the time that only injected ascorbate might deliver the concentrations needed to see an anti tumor effect
1409884 nihs unique translational environment where researchers can pursue intellectual high risk out of the box thinking with high potential payoff enabled us to pursue this work
1409885 people tended to take new orleans for granted as a party town with a specific kind of music when they realized such a treasure had been severely damaged if not lost forever they were forced to reconsider what new orleans meant as a cultural resource for the country
1409886 new orleans was on everybodys mind and there was this real hunger for its music musicians found themselves busier than they had been in years
1409887 you can have my husband but please dont mess with my man
1409888 people always thought of new orleans as the big easy bourbon street mardi gras and jazzfest home of this old time good time music
1409889 in katrinas wake you couldnt watch the devastation deaths and flooding and associate new orleans with good times so people were looking to artists to tell them what does new orleans mean now and to keep the citys legacy alive
1409890 all sorts of strong emotions come through in the music
1409891 when you hear them sing of a return to new orleans its as if theyre singing of a return to the promised land
1409892 it sounded nothing like marvin gaye and nothing like the dirty dozen brass band had done before
1409893 they substituted gayes silky soulfulness for a brassy assertiveness that gave the material new urgency
1409894 its ironic new orleans seemed to have a stronger sense of musical community when its musicians were scattered all over the country because they had this tragedy in common
1409895 its kind of like they were johnny appleseeds sowing the seeds of this music across the country
1409896 we once had a car make a u turn right into a lamppost here
1409897 we were letting children out it could have been a real disaster

1409911 it was a glam rock time when the farm boy from otorohanga would slip out of his black singlet and gumboots and get dressed to go to town

1409940 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1409941 to ensure a degree of diplomatic achievement in the twilight of his term
1409942 the united states gives the impression that it is defending north korea
1409943 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1409944 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice
1409945 they clearly requested that the interahamwes contine to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1409946 partly a sentiment index if things are not getting as bad at a slower rate it can feel like improvement

1409957 kentuckians like all americans are hard hit by record high gas prices
1409958 these tough times call for creative solutions and i believe allowing kentuckians the option of using an electric vehicle is one of those solutions
1409959 may help ease the burden on the pocketbooks of hard working kentucky families as well as reduce their carbon footprint
