4040021 instead of carrying your computer your computer comes to you
4040022 the main sales will shortly be upon us and with many farmers desperate for a good trade after last years problems the last thing anyone needs is for sheep to go unsold because they are incorrectly identified at sales
4040023 in essence the rules require all sheep born in 2008 and not intended for slaughter before 12 months of age to be double tagged either by nine months old in extensive systems or when they leave the holding of birth
4040024 crucially they only apply to sheep born in 2008 so shearling ewes will still only require one holding of birth tag when moving this autumn
4040025 het is denk ik onterecht dat gemeenten aan de slag moeten met de megastallen plannen van acht jaar geleden gingen over 2000 tot 3000 varkens en wilden de gezinsbedrijven in het landschap houden inmiddels gaat het om beduidend meer dieren en zijn het lang niet altijd meer gezinsbedrijven dat rechtvaardigt dat er opnieuw naar wordt gekeken en het vraagt ook meer regie van de overheid
4040026 zijn advies om geen bedrijventerrein in de hoeksche waard aan te leggen omdat er elders voldoende alternatieven zijn gaf denk ik de doorslag in de al jaren durende politieke discussie wij kijken als ontwerpers naar oplossingen soms wat radicaler dan beleidsmakers maar ook wat consequenter dat kan soms een zetje geven
4040027 nu is dat vooral een planologisch begrip het is een open gebied waar alle steden naar kijken en er is beleid om het opknabbelen tegen te gaan ik zou hier graag een zone zien waar de natuur meer kans krijgt terwijl ook mensen ervan kunnen genieten ook de melkveehouderijen moeten er een plaats krijgen en er moet ruimte komen voor waterberging door een landschappelijke verbinding te maken tussen de biesbosch en het ijmeer verstevig je het deltalandschap en als er zon gemeenschappelijk perspectief is werkt het makkelijker
4040028 het is ook zinvol eens in beeld te brengen wat er gebeurt als 26 gemeenten in friesland elk hun eigen park met grote windturbines neerzetten dat maakt de opgave waar we voor staan wel duidelijk je laat zien wat er aan de hand is en praktijkgerichte adviezen maken de discussie minder abstract
4040029 dit is een mooie tijd voor een landschapsadviseur het advies van de commissie veerman verschijnt begin september en ook dat geeft aan dat landschap geen luxe is maar een urgente kwestie juist omdat al die grote opgaven er liggen is er ruimte de avontuurlijke kant te benutten er moeten antwoorden worden gevonden op de gevolgen van de stijgende zeespiegel maar dat biedt ook de kans om heel veel plezier en landschapswaarde terug te brengen

4040059 we hebben het aanbod van sharepoint diepgaand geanalyseerd in het sharepoint report wijzen wij potenti le kopers op de omstandigheden waarin sharepoint prima functioneert en de omstandigheden waarin het mogelijk zwak scoort we ontdeden sharepoint van het ecm vernis waarmee het aan de man wordt gebracht en vertaalden de potenti le toepassing van dit product in acht bedrijfsscenarios
4040060 ten eerste sharepoint is geen product sharepoint is een bundel van vele producten onder de sharepoint vlag het heeft een aantal sterke out of the box functionaliteiten maar in veel gevallen is sharepoint complexer dan men zou verwachten het is in de kern een behoorlijk goed product maar niet iedereen heeft er positieve ervaringen mee
4040061 ik kan veel voorbeelden geven van gebruikers die contact met ons opnamen om te klagen maar veel van die klachten komen uit organisaties waar sharepoint is ingezet in een voor dit product totaal ongeschikte omgeving blijkbaar is er daar veel misgegaan in het inkoopproces andere leveranciers werden vaak helemaal niet overwogen er bestond dan het idee dat sharepoint wel een ecm product moet zijn omdat het als zodanig aan de man wordt gebracht en dat het dus moeiteloos kan worden vergeleken met tools van ecm platformleveranciers als ibm filenet en oracle of juist specialistische niche ecm spelers in specifieke branches zoals de gezondheidszorg de overheid en de industrie we weten inmiddels dat het in veel gevallen veel en intensief en daarmee kostbaar werk vergt om sharepoint in deze situaties optimaal te laten presteren in sommige gevallen verlaat men dan sharepoint en stapt men over op een meer geschikte tool maar de eerlijkheid gebiedt mij te zeggen dat er ook veel voorbeelden te noemen zijn van kostbare ecm implementaties die slechts een fractie gebruiken van wat de tool te bieden heeft en waar sharepoint een prima en goedkoper alternatief had kunnen zijn
4040062 nee ik denk dat microsoft van goede wil is maar ik kan dit niet altijd zeggen van zijn partners de afgelopen tijd stuitten wij op een aantal vreselijke voorbeelden waarin sharepoint werd verkocht door een partner om de doodsimpele reden dat de implementatiepartner dan extra uren kon maken om de tool werkend te krijgen in een omgeving die absoluut ongeschikt was voor sharepoint het grootste grootste probleem is volgens mij de term ecm enterprise content management de filosofie van microsoft op dit concept wijkt sterk af van de perceptie die de rest van de markt sinds het jaar 2000 heeft zo wordt het voor gebruikers al snel appels met peren vergelijken
4040063 ja absoluut sharepoint wijzigt de spelregels toen ik voor het eerst schreef over sharepoint in 1998 toen het product zich eigenlijk nog in een pril stadium verkeerde voorspelde ik al dat het de ecm markt op zijn grondvesten zou doen laten schudden maar ja dat was niet echt een moeilijke voorspelling leveranciers die hun strategie niet veranderen en f de concurrentie aangaan met sharepoint f sharepoint juist omarmen en faciliteren krijgen het zwaar te verduren veel leveranciers doen het juist goed dankzij sharepoint hetzij door oplossingen te bieden bovenop sharepoint hetzij door zich te richten op gebieden die sharepoint helemaal niet dekt
4040064 gelukkig heb ik geen kristallen bol nodig maar gewoon gezond boerenverstand en een brede kennis van de markt in de wereld van collaborative documentmanagement en het delen van office bestanden voor projectteams zal microsoft een leidende rol blijven spelen maar een verhevigde concurrentie van partijen als ibm en op termijn google ligt op de loer de echte ecm wereld zal sharepoint op de desktop gaan faciliteren maar in de markt van high volume fast through put producten waarin oracle ibm en emc elkaar bevechten zal veel hetzelfde blijven omdat microsoft hier gewoon geen rol van betekenis in speelt ook in een service oriented omgeving met meerdere talen omgevingen en transacties zal sharepoint geen product van betekenis zijn
4040065 in het begin waren zij niet zo dol op sharepoint omdat zij vreesden dat het product hun lucratieve integratieprojecten in gevaar zou brengen de laatste tijd omarmen zij echter sharepoint omdat zij samen met sharepoint gebruikers ontdekken dat sharepoint zich in sommige gevallen ook kan ontpoppen als een complexe ontwikkelomgeving dit wordt kwalijk in de gevallen dat een grote integratiepartij sharepoint als de beste oplossing naar voren schuift waar duurdere producten de gevraagde functionaliteit gewoon out of the box aanbieden de verkopers van zon system integrator bieden dan toch sharepoint aan omdat zij verwachten veel en uiteindelijk voor de klant kostbaar integratiewerk te moeten verrichten zo wordt goedkoop alsnog duurkoop
4040066 behandel sharepoint zoals je ook de producten van andere leveranciers behandelt vergelijk het met de concurrentie en analyseer de tool grondig voordat je welke beslissing dan ook neemt zorg ervoor dat je idee van wat ecm nou precies is overeenstemt met de definitie die de partijen waar je mee praat hanteren microsoft laat zich graag voorstaan met de integratie die sharepoint biedt met zijn ms office producten maar er zijn nog andere tools die op dit punt een prima alternatief bieden gebruik dit argument in de onderhandeling met microsoft en zijn partners of je het nu uit het cms watch report haalt of niet zorg ervoor dat je onafhankelijk advies inwint
4040067 ik ben op 17 september in utrecht voor een workshop over ecm en sharepoint ik begin met een kritische evaluatie van de sterkten en zwakten van sharepoint gebaseerd op klantervaringen en door mijzelf uitgevoerde tests met inzichten en discussies krijgt de deelnemer inzicht hoe waar wanneer en waarom sharepoint kan worden ingezet ik ga ook in op de manier waarop sharepoint kan worden ingezet bij diverse typen organisaties met verschillende bedrijfsdoelen het lijkt me interessant om mensen uit de benelux te ontmoeten om te praten over dit onderwerp ik kijk er echt naar uit

4040073 when the local defence volunteers the fore runner of the home guard were formed in great britain their formation was not extended to northern ireland in response the inspector general of the royal ulster constabulary offered the northern ireland prime minister the services of the ulster special constabulary to fill the gap and fulfil the role under taken by the ldvs in great britain this resulted in the formation of the local defence volunteers section yes thank you again but its not particularly helpful as its not dated sign in before you can post messages join this group please update your nickname on the yourplace com gt wrote gt gt gt on the other hand and bringing it right back the only only part of the gt gt gt uk gt gt gt where no home guard or ldf was in northern ireland for fear on the part gt gt gt of gt gt gt the local government that arming catholics would not be a desirable gt gt gt outcome gt gt hmm the queens university student rag mag is called ptq one gt gt of the wartime covers showed a pair of armed and uniformed home gt gt guards marching smartly past a couple of scruffy specials with sticks gt gt and a bad case of weapons envy gt gt so i am fairly sure the home guard existed here too gt well eventually they were formally named that but it was largely a gt cosmetic exercise gt in britain the hg were a military organisation under the territorial army gt in northern ireland local defence consisted entirely of b specials a gt police force and in its original guise of the ulster defence volunteers was gt nothing more than a branch of that force to whit the local defence gt volunteers section gt this was then passed unchanged to the control of the ruc and when this gt section was actually renamed as the ulster home guard it was still manned gt by the same cadre of b specials and still a police force gt finally they did come under the direct command of the british army but they gt and their b special parent organisation were used interchangeably in the gt local defence role gt in short a very different organisation to the british home guard and with gt no affiliations with that organisation whatsoever just for the record they the b specials were seen by the british police as an affiliated

4040110 i would say it is about three quarters finished however i have not seen any activity there for about two months
4040111 then there is the proposed extension to the parkway shopping centre that has also gone very quiet
4040112 there is no doubt that the world economy has taken a downturn and we have been caught up in it
4040113 the banks and other lending institutions have become very careful and are more or less telling us that it is time to batten down the hatches i am not suggesting that is the reason for the slowdown on the dublin road anybody going into banks now for money woud want to have all their homework done in advance and be in a watertight situation

4040233 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

4040242 mais je pense que nous avons un nombre de r formes qui vont entrer en vigueur maintenant qui vont nous mettre dans le bon sens
4040243 ce film est le plus dur que jai eu tourner les diff rents crans pr sents dans le cadre ont rendu les choses difficiles comme si nous avions faire un film dans un film dans un film etc il fallait filmer laction ainsi que tout ce quil se passait dans les crans ce fut pour cela tr s complexe mais la sc ne qui ma demand le plus de mal cest sans doute celle o tom est allong avec agatha sur le lit rempli de photos denfants et d couvre que leo crow mike binder arrive cest une sc ne tr s forte du point de vue des sentiments de l motion
4040244 c tait en effet un film tr s complexe mais steven a le don de rendre les choses faciles de mettre tout le monde laise pour cette sc ne dont il parlait il ma dit de sourire en prenant la photo et cela ma beaucoup facilit le travail le reste de la s quence sest fait tr s naturellement
4040245 je ne suis pas plus attir par le futur que par le pass jaime beaucoup lhistoire mais je suis aussi tr s int ress par lavenir et ce dautant plus depuis que jai des enfants on se projette alors dans le futur en essayant de penser au monde quils auront plus tard
4040246 la lecture est quelque chose qui manque dans nos coles jencourage mes enfants lire le danger de la technologie est la disparition des livres qui sont de plus en plus disponibles en vid o ou en cd je crains la perte du manuscrit de la chose tactile dans quelle mesure la technologie va t elle empi ter sur notre vie priv e
4040247 tourner avec kubrick et avec spielberg sont deux exp riences totalement diff rentes avec steven nous sommes amis depuis longtemps je lui ai m me demand des conseils quand jai su que jallais tourner avec stanley le tournage d fut dautant plus inoubliable que c tait le dernier film de kubrick mais les films de steven font partie de ma vie jai vu quand j tais jeune avec toute ma famille jai grandi avec ses films
4040248 jai tourn ce film avant les v nements du 11 septembre 2001 et lhistoire est adapt e dune nouvelle des ann es 50 il ny a donc aucune utilisation de cette actualit mais en tant quartistes tom et moi sommes tr s sensibles tout ce qui se passe sur terre
4040249 tom est lun des acteurs que je connais qui attache le plus dimportance la promotion de ses films il fait le tour du monde pour chacune de ses sorties moi je suis venu en france pour la promotion de
4040250 en fait ce nest pas nous qui d cidons enti rement du planning de promotion mais jai un emploi du temps tr s charg entre ma vie priv e mes enfants les tournages et la promotion des films demain par exemple nous partons rome etc
4040251 je termine actuellement le mixage de et jai d j fait beaucoup de promotion los angeles pour dont quatre jours pour la presse internationale en plus jai sept enfants que jemm ne tous les matins l cole
4040252 je suis persuad que tom a beaucoup de talent et quil a toutes les comp tences pour r aliser un film il est capable de faire ressortir tout ce quil y a dans un acteur jai vu le court m trage quil a r alis et je suis s r quil devrait se lancer dans laventure dun long

4040257 you cant feel the pleasure of the treasure without pressure
4040258 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4040259 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4040260 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4040261 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4040262 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4040263 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4040264 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4040265 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4040266 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4040267 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4040268 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4040269 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4040270 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4040271 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4040272 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4040273 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4040274 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4040275 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4040276 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4040277 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4040278 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4040279 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4040280 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4040281 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4040282 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4040283 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4040284 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4040285 most service stations have the infrastructure and buying power of supermarkets like asda which led the recent price cuts at the supermarket pumps and has now introduced a fuel pricing policy but they dont seem to be using that commercial strength to help motorists
4040286 meanwhile as we hit the peak summer holiday driving season and with fuel prices at current levels every penny counts
4040287 we want all of this to be simple and risk to be nominal the main area in which people have difficutly is assessing their wealth and risk factors far too often we see e gaming photographic images investors jumping into a portfolio that is far too aggressive the end result can be disasterous invoking many to file bankruptcy
4040288 my top tip is making baby steps before giant leaps
4040289 by starting slowly your risk factor is greatly diminished and financial commitment is much lower you can get out at any time with minimal losses or move forward into more risky e gaming photographic images areas with good fundamental knowledge
4040290 give yourself a nice cussion of cash and retirement income
4040291 personally i save about 10 each month for retirement 20 as liquid cash for everyday needs and another 40 for investing this may sound very demanding especially with regard to e gaming photographic images investments but in actuality it is really a reflection of what you want for your future not necessarily what you want now
4040292 the motivation to have money from a e gaming photographic images portfolio in the future is great
4040293 but dont forget that you cant live in the future forever many people fall into the trap of not meeting basic needs in the present which logically means that their future will become progressively more difficult
4040294 make e gaming photographic images investments work for you and retire wealthy
4040295 were looking at the long term here quick wins are for lotteries and penny poker games not the e gaming photographic images investment market i think given enough time those who invest in this area will see good returns for their e gaming photographic images money
4040296 i invest heavily in areas that look promising but also proportionately balance my risk by putting some money in standard investments such as stocks bonds and money market funds
4040297 one has to balance artistic talent with the rigors of usable multimedia
4040298 and as a result we tend to only hire those who are from accredited design universitys such as risd
4040299 we love using intense flash graphics for our weekly work
4040300 this will offer some welcome relief to the petrochemicals heavyweights whilst gold has also broken its recent losing streak
4040301 theres not much fundamental data due for release on the domestic calendar today theres no high profile economic news
4040302 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4040303 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4040304 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4040305 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4040306 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4040307 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4040308 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

4040315 and what are you going to do when the drive dies

4040327 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4040328 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4040329 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4040330 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4040331 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4040332 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4040333 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4040334 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4040335 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4040336 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4040337 how am i gonna build the team go to europe and kick some ass without bigger riders
4040338 thats crazy the guy is a world champion he needs a pay cheque
4040339 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4040340 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4040341 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4040342 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4040343 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4040344 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

4040361 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4040362 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4040363 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4040364 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades

4040369 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4040370 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4040371 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4040372 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4040373 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4040374 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

4040378 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4040379 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

4040560 hes the one that calls the shots hes the one that lays it out theres the trust i cant think of any other coach id rather be with
4040561 there are coaches in this world who know as much as i know and probably more but its how the athletes trust you that counts the most
4040562 its very different from anything it gets some people like that straightaway
4040563 otherwise i just think rowing all the time and then youre chasing your tail because youre thinking about the same thing over and over again whereas if i can think of something else the answers right there
4040564 when it comes down to this time of the year when youre two days away from racing any change thats good feels like a huge change and its motivating
4040565 mikes got a ton of those you think oh ive learned everything i could possibly learn ive been rowing for this guy for eight years he cant possibly surprise me
4040566 yet at our training camp in japan and again here hes come up with stuff where there you go we got another inch and its all about those inches and he knows how to get it out of us
4040567 to be the best in the world is bloody hard because there are too many people that want it the human being naturally doesnt want to go through that level of intensity dont want to do it so i have to find a way to help them to do it
4040568 when it comes to winning its a matter of feet or inches
4040569 sometimes you have to double your output to get half a second the question is as an athlete do you want to go for that half a second some athletes are happy not to have it
4040570 some athletes if theyre of the right ilk want every inch they can get and give everything they can to get every inch and thats what makes champions
4040571 i was completely fine with chellsie competing because at the 06 worlds she finished with her shoulder completely torn thats just what she does for the team a little broken ankle wasnt going to stop her this is the olympics how many people can say they have an olympic medal not many of course it would have been good to get the gold but were all thrilled with the silver
4040572 but nothing like what has happened in the past few weeks
4040573 our announcement just seemed to happen right as everyone is getting more and more concerned about the bigger environmental picture of sustainability
4040574 over the next few years we will probably see many products we use every day reengineered with more sustainable components these soybean urinals are just a bit ahead of their time
4040575 there were a lot of growing pains when it came to getting stronger getting better but weve done that we really have
4040576 theres a place for baseball in china i think they have great athletes and i think when they go through more experiences like this youre going to start seeing baseball rise and theyre going to get good real soon
4040577 we are a much better team than we showed yesterday
4040578 i have been proud of these players because theyve worked very hard and we were playing pretty good ball coming into the olympics
4040579 there was an enormous amount of pressure on these guys and its just part of the development its part of the experience
4040580 baseball is still a very young sport in china they dont have little league they dont have high school they dont have college so theres a lot of catching up to do
4040581 the first fencer i fought had a very strong technique which better suited my fencing style i prefer attacks which give me more time to react
4040582 the italian sanzo in my second bout was very fast and because of his style i had little time to react he dominated throughout the competition
4040583 we knew we were going to the quarter finals before the game and that was a bit of a factor in our strategy
4040584 i dont think there is any reason for us to lose confidence over the results because the results havent shown how weve been playing
4040585 weve been head to head with them so many times especially recently we are in the mindset now that its our turn to win
4040586 theyre still the best of friends but any romantic spark has well and truly gone
4040587 hes an unbelievable pitcher i knew he was going to do well
4040588 just see ing myself in a pot of boiling water with all these natives dancing around me
4040589 balancing on morning streetcar without a bar to hold onto while clutching a coffee and restraining yourself from destroying the obnoxiously booming ipod of the angsty tween beside you
4040590 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
4040591 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
4040592 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4040593 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
4040594 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
4040595 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologized
4040596 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
4040597 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
4040598 dont give up on us the games are not over the medals are going to come we want medals too
4040599 theres no margin for mistakes against these guys said despatie of the top eight field
4040600 at least not mistakes like we made it was open we could have done much better
4040601 eternal diver at age 37 at this his first and last olympics admitted hed anticipated coming away from the water cube with at least bronze and had visualized breaking canadas o for olympics maiden
4040602 i thought we were the ones but we werent he said
4040603 in my view were walking away from here disappointed and not disappointed because luck didnt go our way i feel we gave that medal away bottom line
4040604 alex knows what to do when the whistle blows we were very pleased by his individual diving i think it was clear for anyone to see
4040605 arturo was affected by his forward approach dives thats where his weakest link is anything that was facing forward when hes affected by his nerves you could see he lacked stability that threw some of his timing off and the judges were really focused on exact timing in this event
4040606 i cant play with gravity very well despatie shrugged when asked if he might not have been able to slow down a tad accommodate mirandas lesser thrust
4040607 we used to have this little joke that we always hoped alex felt just a little bit sick
4040608 its disappointing to finish my career like that he said
4040609 alle kennziffern lagen ber den sch tzungen es wurde sogar ein berschuss gemeldet obwohl am markt mit einem verlust gerechnet wurde
4040610 wir bleiben vor allem besorgt ber den wachsenden druck auf den gesch ftsbereich von versatel in einem schwierigen wirtschaftlichen umfeld
4040611 i imagine if i was a man its like getting kicked in the nuts repeatedly
4040612 thats how bad it feels you feel like you want to curl up and die
4040613 unfricking believable wow sorry it hasnt sunk in yet give me a couple of brandies and ill feel better
4040614 basically its like shes been trying to push this victory for years
4040615 she tried to make sure that i wouldnt be fencing in the country of hungary four years ago when i tried to come there its quite a personal vendetta
4040616 they were relaxed and i was hitting on the outside
4040617 i felt ready i felt prepared and then i just sucked in the last three minutes
4040618 i know no canadian taxpayer wants to hear that i really did try my best and i really did give everything i had
4040619 but i swear to all of you that are listening that i really did and im very sorry that i didnt bring home a medal but you know you train and you take your chances
4040620 i honestly didnt want to live after i lost i was like i am such a loser i dont deserve to live now im just feeling like you know what i lost i was well prepared but i just didnt do what i had to do in the last three minutes hopefully i can change that
4040621 this is why i love it and why i want to take part in this great party here
4040622 before the start of the competition i need to be thinking more but when i go into the ring i know i dont have to think about anything because all the chinese people stand beside me
4040623 at cfs we have a very old set of core banking technologies that were developed in the 1960s
4040624 those systems are becoming very expensive to support slow to get new products out to market on and cost us quite a lot of money when it comes to meeting regulatory requirements
4040625 we want to offer an integrated complete full service and to do that we need a more modern core platform
4040626 the way the business will manage the migration will be one of the most challenging aspects of this programme but risks will be mitigated by very detailed planning testing and having fallbacks at every stage
4040627 we will be very careful before doing a cutover to the new technology to be certain that we do not lose any data in the process
4040628 the key is to integrate the software into the environment and then migrate the business onto it
4040629 and if anything goes wrong we have an existing system that is stable to back us up
4040630 there was a dislocation of the elbow but the bones are not broken
4040631 they just put it right back but i think hes lost the rest of the year
4040632 if the ligaments are damaged then it could take several months to heal
4040633 but the number of injuries are quite small in comparison with the number of athletes you cannot even compare it with football for example
4040634 hes 24 so at least he has two more olympics
4040635 ive been using it ever since and never had any problems
4040636 you watch the olympics on tv growing up and now its like hey im living this
4040637 i walked in there and saw it empty and it was a little overwhelming
4040638 when its full its going to be nuts i think the biggest problem will not be taking off that first lap because i will be so pumped up
4040639 we are not thinking about australia and thats an honest answer thats the best part about this team they really stay in the moment
4040640 s a creat o tensiune ntre ei de ceva timp ini ial au optat pentru o pauz sper nd c i vor nt ri rela ia din p cate se pare c nu a mers
4040641 au vorbit la telefon de c nd s au desp r it i ncearc s r m n n
4040642 the entire conversation and the entire desires were initiated by mr barany
4040643 it was very transparent that it was a 13 year old girl and it was very transparent that he was engaging in this conversation to at some point engage in a lewd act with her
4040644 as a teacher he really is a trusted member of the community and he couldnt have done anything worse to break that trust
4040645 theyre constantly monitoring web sites dealing with financial fraud identity theft and sites that may engage in exploitation of children
4040646 its all about cramming in as many calories into my system as i possibly can
4040647 theres nobody in any sport that can win like he wins
4040648 hes not just winning hes crunching world records and crunching the fields its amazing
4040649 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race
4040650 i wanted to break the record i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
4040651 just think how fast that would have been we were looking for an amazingly fast swim the way he had swum in the semifinals and the prelims he would have been at least a second faster
4040652 we just basically give him a little training and try to just keep him happy bowman is meticulous in his approach leaving no minute in the day unaccounted for on monday as phelps stood talking in the mixed zone after the heats of the 200 butterfly bowman stood stewing in another part of the building his mind was already racing ahead to the weekend and the possibility that the lactic acid settling in phelps muscles as he talked might have an adverse effect on one of his later performances bowman cheerfully acknowledged that worrying came with the territory when handling a once in a lifetime talent like phelps im scared about everything
4040653 thats my job im trying to think about my plan and are we on it
4040654 i think one of the reasons ive been able to be like this is because ive been there before
4040655 in athens michael may have been too young to even appreciate what the olympic games is
4040656 its kind of like all the little lessons weve been working on for the last dozen years theyre all there to see
4040657 will have tens of millions of dollars more from them supporting the business as we go through the recovery plan
4040658 it is about our ability to get the property market moving again and start to deal with some of these assets
4040659 i have seen absolutely nothing in my time around the board table that would lead me to believe that the company was managed in a bad way
4040660 decentralized solar arrays avoid the cost and hassle of building new high voltage transmission lines
4040661 they also enable local ownership which should be a goal of public policy
4040662 ownership converts citizens into energy producers which in turn gives them a personal stake in expanding the use of renewable energy
4040663 it also encourages them to maximize energy efficiency because the greater the efficiency the more independent they become perhaps even becoming a net exporter of electricity
4040664 weve been waiting on this opportunity since they beat us its getting on two years now and we havent forgotten
4040665 we are really looking forward to playing them and seeing where we are because we know they are a very good team
4040666 it wasnt something we worked on for a long period of time whereas now we have been working on it for the last two years
4040667 i think we are much improved in defending it now i think that greece game two years ago opened up our eyes and showed us some things that we had to work on
4040668 during her childhood kamala used to stammer but she could at least help her mother sailabala in all household chores
4040669 kamala is educated she attended a school nearby and studied up to class x however she developed a mental illness by that time and started showing streaks of violence
4040670 i work as a daily wage earner and it is impossible to arrange funds for her treatment
4040671 kamala used to tear off all her clothes and we had no money to buy new ones
4040672 i got on the phone and called my wife and made sure that they were safe
4040673 ironically we came through security at the same time we were thankful to be here and to be able to race
4040674 we really spent the last three days making sure that we were focused within ourselves not being afraid of failure and not letting that fear get in the way of having a good race
4040675 because the fear and the nerves can get to you and overcome your sense of ease that makes you row a lot better we just went out there trying to be focused and be loose
4040676 we just went through that over and over and over
4040677 we have a lot of confidence in our crew and we know from previous races this summer that we continually progress throughout the racing we seem to get better and better
4040678 i think we were all quite confident that this would be a much better performance than our heats
4040679 pemimpin pas bertemu dengan pimpinan umno adalah restu daripada majlis syura ulama dan rundingan yang diadakan bukan untuk mendapatkan kerusi atau jawatan
4040680 tetapi apa yang kita lakukan untuk memastikan mereka menerima islam
4040681 perlukan kepemimpinan ulama hanya mengutamakan pandangan aspek politik semata mata dan meninggalkan perkara sebenar dalam dakwah
4040682 sayangilah jemaah dengan panduan al quran dan bukan sahaja dengan kepentingan politik
4040683 pastikan segala langkah yang diambil oleh ahli mestilah berdasarkan panduan dari al quran
4040684 products like enviroglas generate a lot of interest and inquiries from people responsible for designing building and buying homes office buildings and school facilities
4040685 using recycled glass and porcelain to create beautiful eco friendly floor tiles counter tops and decorative landscaping has given enviroglas a great marketing edge in the green building business architects home owners and builders are consistently requesting information and samples of this product

4040691 when you play so nicely like this i think you deserve a big hug special treat extra privilege
4040692 if you dont settle down ill have to ask you to leave the room and return when you can stay here quietly
4040693 left and right all americans know that freedom is better that slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
4040694 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love
4040695 whoever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind
4040696 members of the antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of far eastern nations in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there do they understand their responsibility today or do they prefer not to hear
4040697 will this bring us closer together or will it push us further apart will this give my spouse pleasure or pain
4040698 i want you to accept my weakness in this area and stop berating me
4040699 would i rather get what i want through planning or not get it at all

4040723 this contract will take me to 34 and if you look around there are a lot of top professionals playing like ryan giggs players like that offering a lot to their club both on the pitch and off it
4040724 and i certainly feel that i can do that in a big way
4040725 yes the manchester united game and what they did there i sat and watched that game with my family and what they did there it was a very emotional moment
4040726 i will never forget it i cant speak highly enough of the lads and what they did john terry as a captain creates that kind of spirit among the lads and the others follow because they are all great lads
4040727 when you go to your mums funeral you dont expect all the players to go there you might expect a representative from the club i had all the lads there and thats something that goes beyond football and shows you what real men are and what real friendships are
4040728 i made my decision for frank lampard simple as that i want to do what is best for me my family and my football
4040729 all i can say is that he is one of the best managers in the world hes shown that when he was here and i have no doubts he will be successful in the future wherever he goes
4040730 if he gets on the bus he has every chance of being picked
4040731 we have a good draw and i think a good chance to go through but we must approach it professionally
4040732 you can lose to anybody they are professionals as well and will want to win the first leg at least
4040733 on a bad day if we are not concentrating then we can lose this kind of game so we must be careful and take it seriously we took odense seriously in the intertoto cup and that is how we should always be
4040734 i dont really like to talk about attitude because we are all professionals and get a lot of money to play football
4040735 we want to reverse the process using the exhaust system to harvest the waste heat and convert as much as possible to electric power

4040741 der wirtschaftsrat lehnt staatliche konjunkturprogramme ab wachstum kann nur durch ein berzeugendes programm struktureller reformen gest tzt werden
4040742 der wirtschaftsrat erteilt staatlichen konjunkturprogrammen eine massive abfuhr das verbrennen von steuermilliarden in programmstrohfeuern hat sich hinl nglich genug als irrweg herausgestellt noch heute stottern wir die kredite f r die wirkungslosen programme der 70er jahre m hsam ab in zeiten der globalisierung verpuffen staatliche konjunkturspritzen in einer so exportabh ngigen volkswirtschaft wie deutschland noch deutlich schneller als damals daher m ssen wir alle anstrengungen unternehmen wachstum und besch ftigung durch strukturelle reformen nachhaltig zu st rken

4040780 daher sehe ich es als eine wichtige verantwortung f r uns als dem europ ischen team hierf r entsprechende strukturen prozesse und strategien aufzustellen
4040781 der deutliche r ckgang des deutschen bruttoinlandsprodukts um 0 5 prozent im 2 quartal 2008 ist ein alarmsignal f r die wirtschaftspolitik notwendig ist jetzt eine konsequente strategie um das wachstumspotenzial der deutschen wirtschaft nachhaltig zu steigern auch bei gegenwind
4040782 bildung forschung innovation und infrastruktur geh ren ins zentrum der strategie f r wachstum und besch ftigung zudem muss der arbeitenden mittelschicht durch niedrigere steuern und abgaben mehr netto vom brutto bleiben
4040783 deutschland braucht kein konjunkturelles strohfeuer das nach kurzem auflodern nur einen haufen asche hinterl sst
4040784 selbst wenn das bip im dritten quartal erneut schrumpft steckt deutschland noch nicht in der rezession die kapazit ten der deutschen volkswirtschaft sind immer noch berdurchschnittlich ausgelastet
4040785 deshalb wenden sich die unternehmer dagegen die stimmung schlecht zu reden deutschland kann mehr die politik muss statt verteilungsfragen die wachstumsthemen forcieren f r neuen wohlstand neue arbeitspl tze neue lebensqualit t

4040791 after quick transfer of the mocvd process to our first crius systems in 2007 this is the second repeat order for crius systems and this technology has become one of the main platforms for our large scale high end led production that we have been able to make such good progress in the marketplace so quickly is largely due to the excellent performance of the aixtron mocvd equipment backed up by top grade local support
4040792 this order for our crius ccs tools confirms the exceptional capabilities in the design and operation of these systems time and again customer orders such as this reaffirm how well the crius meets the challenges of mass production even in the most exacting materials environments
4040793 allen bedenkentr gern zum trotz hat die glasurit reihe 90 international karriere gemacht
4040794 der lack deckt hervorragend ist sehr umweltschonend und spart unseren damit kunden viel zeit und material
4040795 au erdem ist er einfach zu handhaben weswegen immer neue unternehmen auf das wasserbasierte basislacksystem umsteigen
4040796 die umweltschonende anwendung geht jedoch nicht zulasten der produktqualit t
4040797 ganz im gegenteil lacke der reihe 90 zeichnen sich durch hohe mechanische chemische und physikalische best ndigkeit aus
4040798 wasserbasierte lacksysteme werden sich noch weiter ausbreiten ihnen geh rt die zukunft
4040799 despite all skepticism glasurit 90 line has made an international career
4040800 the coating has an excellent hiding power it is environmentally compatible and saves our customers time and material
4040801 additionally it is easy to use and this is the reason why an increasing number of bodyshops switches over to waterborne basecoats
4040802 this environmental compatibility is not detrimental to the product quality quite the contrary is true 90 line paints convince with high mechanic chemical and physical resistance
4040803 die entscheidung vieler firmen ihre auslandsproduktion nach deutschland zur ckzuholen zeigt dass der standort deutschland und besonders bayern wieder deutlich an attraktivit t gewinnt
4040804 nach berechnungen des fraunhofer instituts f r system und innovationsforschung in karlsruhe haben in den letzten acht jahren ber 3500 firmen allein in den branchen metall und chemie ihre produktion aus dem ausland zur ckgeholt
4040805 ich begr e es dass die unternehmen ihre standortentscheidungen zunehmend realistischer angehen die analyse aller relevanten standortfaktoren im vorfeld eines auslandsengagements erfolgt heute gr ndlicher
4040806 zwar werden unsere bayerischen firmen die die n he zu neuen m rkten suchen sicher auch k nftig im ausland produzieren wir werden aber alles unternehmen um den standort bayern im internationalen wettbewerb weiterhin so konkurrenzf hig wie m glich zu halten deswegen rechne ich mit weiter steigenden r ckverlagerungen von auslandsproduktionen

4040817 i dont know why do i always have to decide
4040818 i guess so why not weve been doing that forever anyways
4040819 i always do this youre doing the exact same thing youre exactly as indecisive as i am
4040820 looks like were both equally at fault for this nothingness this boredom this despair
4040821 i dont know what do you want to do about it
4040822 we never do we never do its the same thing every time for all eternity
4040823 time hasnt been invented yet how should i know its been a long time though an infinite amount id say i couldnt count it even if we had numbers
4040824 funny thing that we have words for all these things we havent invented
4040825 well duh were going to invent them eventually we already know that we dont live in some kind of timestream were snug outside of it looking down on it as one big whole
4040826 not really im pretty sure if i was someone else listening to us that i would call myself crazy
4040827 you are quite the looney has insanity been invented yet because im sure youd qualify
4040828 was it you that said that or was it me i lost track of who said what
4040829 me too im sure someone said something along the lines of that
4040830 yeah it doesnt really matter as long as it was said
4040831 i guess no need for us to get word hungry
4040832 we got too many words as it is i wish i could give you some wish we didnt know it
4040833 hard to tell its been forever since weve invented it
4040834 im sure there was a forever that we didnt have it either
4040835 hmm i do say im bored with talking to you
4040836 well i say im beginning to despair as a result
4040837 youre already despairing it makes no difference i think i might keep talking a while longer why not
4040838 well im not going to talk at all any further
4040839 i never understood why we jabber so much in the first place
4040840 wont we ever stop talking i mean honestly there are better things to do with our lives
4040841 not that we have days but you get my manner of speaking dont you
4040842 why hey have you been not talking this entire time
4040843 have i not i thought i was talking the entire time
4040844 but i was convinced you said you were going to stop and i said i was going to continue
4040845 oh no worries no worries its all figured out and done with
4040846 well werent you just saying something about how we could do without all the jabber
4040847 i thought that was you you were the one talking right

4040851 we expect a considerable number of people to return home today since late wednesday they were slowly going back we are assuring them of their safety
4040852 the security situation has improved but it will probably take a bit of time before people feel secure enough to return home en masse
4040853 we have to be looking ahead to people having to potentially rebuild their lives a lot of houses villages have been destroyed
4040854 the relationship has been tainted but our brother muslims agreed we can rebuild it for the sake of our children

4040866 with todays oil prices the project is estimated togenerate a net present value of 4 billion norwegian crowns 748 9 million
4040867 we expect to see a further clear improvement in our sales and financial performance in the second half the various measures designed to boost sales and reduce costs that we implemented in the first half of the year can now take full effect
4040868 i was not thinking about winning two gold medals at two consecutive olympics
4040869 that was never my goal i was just focused on doing my best in beijing
4040870 i cant believe it i know i was feeling down after the relay but i didnt want to get beaten
4040871 i didnt panic when i looked at the board i thought wow i did it
4040872 ive wanted more than anything to have your respect and i cant deny the fact that you like me right now you like me
4040873 you couldnt do it given the sheer time of computing required
4040874 the point of maximum structural complexity in the whole building
4040875 the 20th centurys rosetta stone occupied by architectural mutations central park the skyscraper utopian fragments rockefeller center the u n building and irrational phenomena radio city music hall
4040876 its something thats not really a tower but three dimensional so it defines urban space
4040877 height is the only way to declare their character and since we started the absurdity has become more extreme
4040878 we asked what could a skyscraper be a hundred years later
4040879 we try to articulate the problem instead of focusing on solving the problem
4040880 it was impossible to solve the structure in the conventional way of plugging together parts
4040881 what if we thought of this as something continuous as a tube with an exoskeleton
4040882 its weird for a building but not for other domains like bridges
4040883 we asked should we make all the steel maximum strength
4040884 the third option to make a kind of net that densifies where necessary
4040885 the people who had written the codes we were breaking
4040886 to argue to explain no one is really an expert in what we are doing can it stand is it possible this was a project that couldnt just be designed in rotterdam and handed off
4040887 is not necessarily the word we thought about whether we should take the risk but china is so important we all have a stake in its development
4040888 there was a faction in cctv pushing for more democracy
4040889 that was an important argument in convincing ourselves to engage
4040890 to introduce public access to this institution at the heart of the chinese establishment
4040891 its the ages of the decision makers in the u s and europe the typical age of decision makers for public institutions its 50 to 70 here its 30 or 35 people at the beginning of life they have a sense of adventure
4040892 we are planning to halt the fall in copper production
4040893 we want to stabilise productionfrom our own deposits in 2009 at the level budgeted in the 2008plan
4040894 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4040895 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4040896 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
4040897 it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does after the election in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee
4040898 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4040899 like a lot of people i was sceptical at first that this should be happening
4040900 the scepticism gave way to a real curiosity and a desire to know every wrinkle of it
4040901 it was the first known act of poisoning with a nuclear isotope certainly in the west it was shocking that you would have this happening in grosvenor square just a few hundred yards from the american embassy in a luxury hotel
4040902 how could this happen and nobody be brought to trial or there never be a coroners inquest or an inquiry which brought out everything that scotland yard has found
4040903 mi5 have complained openly that there are as many russian intelligence agents in london as there were during the cold war and keeping tabs on them takes up resources that they would rather devote to fighting terrorism
4040904 it was a widespread view and in a way it was justified by the fact that president yeltsin was an erratic leader the russian military was in steep decline and russias empire had shrunk down to russia itself
4040905 russia defaulted on its debts it was in a mess and it didnt really have a voice in world affairs part of the book chronicles how putin set about turning that around
4040906 but in the process i argued he and the wests handling of him had created a new cold war
4040907 some academics say this is not the old cold war it is about the west trying to encroach on what used to be russias sphere of influence and the russians trying to reassert their influence what we have seen in georgia is by far the most graphic example of that when the cold war flipped over into being a hot war for a week
4040908 western europe is going to rely on russia for 50 per cent of its natural gas by 2020 the network of pipelines bringing out not only russian oil and gas but also the products of the vast new oilfields in kazakhstan and central asia theyre the real power
4040909 it could have been revenge it could have been punishment and it could have been to prevent him from digging deeper into the business affairs of senior figures in russia
4040910 he repeated his denials and said he was the victim of this not the perpetrator
4040911 hes a very interesting guy hes a member of the russian parliament a national hero in russia and a prime suspect in britain
4040912 some of litvinenkos supporters say that if he putin did not know about it what does that say about the security of russian nuclear materials
4040913 when i started writing the book a couple of people i know a very senior international official and an ex military man said you are in very dangerous waters
4040914 one said i should drop the project like a hot potato and the other said i should make sure everything i wrote was stored encrypted on a remote server because you never know the security of your own computer
4040915 i talked to ex kgb and ex intelligence people for quite some time and you do look over your shoulder a bit more but and im touching wood as i say it i was able to write the book and publish it

4040919 add homelessness mental illness or drug addiction into the mix and taking much needed medication falls from the top of the priority list
4040920 we dont know to what extent ongoing drug use interferes or affects the medication they take but crack or heroin interferes with adherence
4040921 theyre more than just an hiv infected person or a person using crack every day or a homeless person these are problems no one can manage by themselves these folks have struggled their whole lives
4040922 on paper they look good but hiv dementia and other problems have set in and even though newer medication has people living longer lives most of our residents probably wont ever go and live on their own
4040923 a chinese will take the bucket from the well and put it down on the sand
4040924 my most immediate task is to get us in the right financial position to take advantage of the sales pipeline and opportunities ahead
4040925 with strong support from key existing shareholders we believe we are close to securing the additional financing that will provide identiphi the capital for longer term stability and put us on the road toward profitability
4040926 children are losing their benefits under this punitive policy change
4040927 clearly the children who are most negatively impacted are children who have the most serious health care needs
4040928 improving health and promoting healthy behaviors are laudable goals but restricting health care coverage for infants and children is not the way to achieve them
4040929 monitoring our enrollment data to gauge the long term success of implementation
4040930 an oversimplification of whats happening with the medicaid program and we truly wish they would have called to ask us about it
4040931 contributing to the shortage is that too few medical students choose primary care
4040932 this is the unfortunate reality of our health care system its an example of how the market triumphs over public policy
4040933 even if universal health care comes into play tomorrow not everyone would have access to a health care provider
4040934 creating a sort of double jeopardy for companies first having to run the fda approval maze then allowing a nationwide quilt of different laws and standards to second guess that approval
4040935 far from representing a radical departure in the law the courts reasoning upheld what had become a common opinion in the federal court system
4040936 reigel only applied to products in the strictest fda tranche known as premarket approval products which represent 1 to 2 of the overall medical device market
4040937 those who believe theyve been injured by medical devices can still sue for a poorly manufactured product or they can attempt to show that the fda didnt get all the necessary information when the device was approved
4040938 what mr waxman really wants to restore is the trial lawyer bingo that can net jackpot jury awards while wreaking havoc on national standards
4040939 democrats want tort lawyers and juries of lawmen to be the ultimate arbiters of new devices then they should do away with the fda entirely and go to an underwriters laboratory system that gets devices to patients more rapidly
4040940 they want it both ways agonizingly slow device approvals and open tort season after the fact
4040941 if congress really wants to improve the quality of medical products for consumers it would better spend its energy on reforming the bureaucratic morass that is the fda
4040942 if i was looking for a business that does what i do what would i search for
4040943 we need to understand how quantum mechanics sees space and time
4040944 the premier spending a week or two there in china doesnt hide the fact nsw is unrepresented for the remaining 50 weeks of the year
4040945 once again they have done australia proud down in the pool and of course great efforts by eamon sullivan and jess schipper
4040946 the competition gets tougher and tougher each time and it continues to be that way
4040947 people keep saying theres water here water there theres water exists that could be released
4040948 lets test that lets have a complete audit of the system so that the people of australia can know exactly what water there is out there in both public and private hands
4040949 the fact that rendermans reyes architecture can now take full advantage of the performance offered by 64 bit windows vista and windows hpc server 2008 means that extremely large datasets impossibly large for 32 bit systems can be rendered this makes it possible to create images with incredible complexity and raises the bar once again for cinematic imagery and visual effects
4040950 the role of the nigerian military in national development towards achieving vision 2020
4040951 concerned that over the past five years the ncacc has not consistently adhered
4040952 the 2003 and 2004 annual reports were only made available last year the ncacc remains in arrears with regard to publicly releasing the 2005 2006 and last years annual arms export reports this has the effect of undermining national and international confidence in the ncaccs procedures for control over the south african arms trade which is one of the objectives of the ncacc
4040953 there are reports that would indicate that its mandate has not always been carried out with the diligence and consistency that the law requires
4040954 a result of adverse publicity rather than a decision of the ncacc as it should have been
4040955 these new provisions constitute a disturbing reduction in the provision of information on weapons transfers the weapons industry is notoriously secretive and in some cases corrupt and one of the few ways in which it can be subjected to proper scrutiny is by having transfers publicly reported

4040957 if coming on the sets of dus ka dum means my film will be a hit then i sure hope it does
4040958 i am a big fan of salman sir i always have been his fan he is such a warm person he has always supported me he was a part of my first film it feels great to be on his show
4040959 i have met him personally at parties and at award functions it is going to be fun being on the show because i have watched a couple of episodes and i know he is very honest person and he speaks from the heart
4040960 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
4040961 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
4040962 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain

4040977 this is a kind of thing that has been happening in the school which was not revealed to the public in fact similar thing happened only two months ago
4040978 it went quite well in that mentally i was very strong but technical conditions didnt go my way and luck wasnt on my side
4040979 i felt i tried the best i could and made one mistake which cost me two targets im disappointed with my score but not my performance when its not your day its not your day
4040980 it was tense out there and the rain did not help matters it was not easy to shoot today
4040981 it really affected my performance because the rain made my gun slippery and i missed several targets

4040985 the talk circulating from teams overseas what theyre willing to do as athletes you have to listen
4040986 i think as a basketball level there is not a great difference between euroleague and the nba

4040997 if i said i did not want to play at this stadium then i would also have to stop training at our sports complex because that is where i picked up my second serious injury

4041017 he got here but was scammed with this phony business deal and had to go back

4041029 theyve very generously allowed people from the festival to come in and speak to the workshop every morning for about an hour and discuss aspects of the play
4041030 a lot of composers today deliberately avoid writing major or minor chords because they feel well thats been done before i dont agree with that

4041112 im really really pleased to see that city council and metro transit take violence in the workplace seriously and that theyre doing what needs to be done
4041113 but its become a real issue the last couple of years because of the amount of violence that has happened against our operators and its our feeling that if we can have cameras on the buses at least we will know who they perpetrators are and its going to be a good thing also for the travelling public

4041144 we need development that doesnt hurt small businesses or the environment

4041147 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4041148 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4041149 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4041150 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4041151 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4041152 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4041153 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4041154 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4041155 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4041156 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4041165 the bbc has always been a strong advocate and driver of open industry standards without these standards tv and radio broadcasting would simply not function
4041166 i believe that the time has come for the bbc to start adopting open standards such as h 264 and aac for our audio and video services on the web these technologies have matured enough to make them viable alternatives to other solutions
4041167 the advantage for the audience will be a noticeable improvement in audio and video quality furthermore it should become easier for the media to simply work across a broader range of devices

4041190 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
4041191 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
4041192 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4041193 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
4041194 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed

4041205 whats shocking to me is how long the court of appeals is taking
4041206 i thought there was a sense of urgency ching said
4041207 ive heard people give me stories like the court should not be rushed into making decisions like this but we do have 2 000 retail investors who have their life savings in limbo
4041208 i think this is a unique enough situation that the decision should be expedited

4041227 if i am at risk from something i need to know what it is
4041228 to step up stand up and stick up for our soldiers
4041229 i have a message for you medea get out of our country
4041230 there is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge
4041231 the adoption is now advanced all the government is waiting for is madonna to forward the petition of adoption formalities then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life
4041232 the government has to take the issue seriously now it is becoming a litmus test of browns ability to show leadership in the country and reconnect with a demoralised party
4041233 revenues from the tax should be ring fenced to deliver social and environmental justice for all part of the money raised should be used to immediately help those struggling with rising fuel bills and should be particularly targeted at families in or facing fuel poverty
4041234 however the best strategy to eliminate fuel poverty forever is to ensure every home is insulated and energy efficient to the highest standards therefore much of the money raised should be used to kick start a national programme of home energy efficiency and installing renewable energy starting with the homes of the fuel poor
4041235 there is evidence of progress but much work still needs to be done
4041236 you should do at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity above usual activity at work or home on at least five days of the week if you are already overweight or obese then you should aim to do between 60 and 90 minutes on five days of the week
4041237 nhs primary care staff felt there was a need for a guide that had appropriate advice for patients
4041238 its up to the discretion of the gp or nurse how they use this information its not about going to the gym but doing things like gardening to benefit health
4041239 this has to operate in tandem with advice support and education on healthy eating and making sensible lifestyle choices in order to make a significant impact on the weight of individuals there has to be a commitment to do as much exercise as possible
4041240 if somebody is suffering from the medical consequences of being obese or overweight they may be at risk of chronic heart disease stroke or have high blood pressure but if they lose weight they are more likely to reduce their health risks so it may be appropriate to raise the potential for exercise with the patient thats a discussion that has to take plac e between the gp and the patient
4041241 its a personal responsibility and people will not be helped unless they want to help themselves
4041242 most people who have not exercised before would struggle even to walk for 90 minutes a day let alone do weight training
4041243 what i generally recommend to my clients is 30minutes three times a week thats based on whats practical for them a lot of people work from 8am to 6pm to tell them that they need to do an extra hour and a half of exercising will put people off i think if i was an obese person i would be quite disheartened
4041244 it is somewhat dictatorial and inappropriate for many people it would be far better to make small changes to your lifestyle

4041265 si no es as preferimos que la asamblea se mantenga sesionando
4041266 no es viable la posibilidad de un acuerdo y el ejecutivo renuncia a reconocer un receso de cuatro d as
4041267 debe ser una decisi n del poder ejecutivo que no me traslade arias las responsabilidades de l
4041268 cre amos que iba a haber voluntad de parte del gobierno yo no s si hay posibilidades de que haya receso
4041269 la fracci n del libertario est en contra y no vamos a dar los votos para un receso

4041294 los embriones del tibur n dormil n requieren al menos de un a o de desarrollo antes de eclosionar salir del huevo
4041295 esta especie de tibur n se captura muy raramente cuando se opera con l nea de fondo en busca de especies como la cabrilla y el pargo en la zona de isla herradura y por lo general se libera vivo pues no tiene inter s comercial
4041296 yo me interes en guardar el especimen pues ya me hab an informado bi logos de pretoma que no exist an registros oficiales de su presencia en costa rica
4041297 la confirmaci n de la presencia del tibur n dormil n en aguas ticas es un ejemplo del poco conocimiento que tenemos acerca de los tiburones y las especies marinas en general

4041301 je moet open en eerlijk zijn tegen de pers maar besef dat de journalist op mag schrijven wat jij hebt gezegd daar kun je later niet meer op terugkomen
4041302 ik vraag vaak wel om het artikel te mogen lezen voor plaatsing maar met aantekeningen moet je redelijk blijven dus alleen beginnen over daadwerkelijke fouten niet over de mening van de journalist
4041303 je moet makkelijk bereikbaar zijn journalisten hebben geen zin om door een hele administratieve molen te gaan om je te pakken te krijgen
4041304 je moet een verhaallijn opschrijven sommige media nemen dat n op n over de serieuzere journalistiek belt je met aanvullende vragen

4041325 i have a question that i dont believe ive seen addressed on your site im interested in pursuing investment banking as it sounds like it gives you a lot of good opportunities in the future my main concern may seem a bit cheesy but im sure many others share it if you choose to enter this profession how and or when do you finally get the time to get have maintain a girlfriend or boyfriend should you just forget about that for your first 2 years as an analyst or is it not even realistic when youre an associate

4041331 if we are successful in bringing the british championships to the braidhaugh at crieff it will be a major coup for the area
4041332 we have already received a number of cash donations and pledges of support from local firms
4041333 and we are now hoping to build on this excellent start
4041334 we must demonstrate that we can provide a secure site capable of holding over 25 000 people with toilet first aid food stalls public address system insurance and all facilities and stewarding required for such a large crowd
4041335 we also have to be able to provide adequate parking for competitors spectators as well as the rspba support staff and guests
4041336 the site has to be big enough to accommodate five competition rings with extra space for tuning and preparation as well as room for a marquee for the highland dance events
4041337 as the tender has to include a tented village area for vendors and display stalls this provides another ideal opportunity for business in the crieff area to get involved and reap the rewards
4041338 as 2010 is the year of perthshires 800th anniversary and the rspbas 80th it would be an extra special occasion to celebrate both landmarks and at the same time put strathearn on the map
4041339 the notoriety that this latest incident has had will go far in sensitizing our students to the fact that really its assault its beyond froshing
4041340 this is not in our minds a froshing or a hazing it was using a paddle which in our minds is a weapon and were treating it that way
4041341 instead of a frosh week we have a welcoming week buddying up grade 10s with grade 12s to help them acclimatize to the school

4041343 in those cases the instructors have the right to tell the person using the device they are causing a disturbance preventing the others from learning
4041344 seneca is always looking at the issue but were hoping as time goes by society as whole will come to an agreement on when and where these electronic devices can be used

4041347 theyre heavily involved in activities for every season and they love it
4041348 this morning we biked down to the coffee shop near their home dropped off dry cleaning and picked up some bread this afternoon they go to swimming lessons
4041349 i believe in these programs not just for physical health but also for their social development
4041350 i dont want them doing that its much better to be outside whether its playing ball or building a snowman
4041351 kids need about 90 minutes of vigorous physical activity a day
4041352 it doesnt have to be consecutive minutes as long as it totals at least 90
4041353 even preschoolers are averaging two hours a day in screen time
4041354 we need to work as parents in getting our kids more physically active we have to teach our children how to play and make the time for them to do it

4041359 sie d rfen nicht wegen ihrer arbeit angegriffen oder festgenommen werden
4041360 residents should hoist the red and white flag three days before and three days after the independence day
4041361 last week i was sleeping during the day and awake all night
4041362 i really have no energy at school when i get little sleep
4041363 i try to concentrate but its so hard i find myself being way too tired to finish my homework
4041364 when theyre having a reasonable amount of sleep theyre okay and theyre lovely kids
4041365 but as soon as you contract their sleep beyond a critical level they become very belligerent disinterested it almost seems that theres a change in personality thats because of the sleep deprivation
4041366 there is a nudging effect of these devices leading to less sleep
4041367 at the beginning of the year when i try to go to bed early ill lie awake oftentimes i get frustrated get up go on the computer and talk to friends its a pretty big stress factor to lie down and not know whether youll lie awake for a few minutes or a few hours
4041368 on average ill have one to two energy drinks in the morning and one in the afternoon if its starting to run out
4041369 your body is tuckered out youre running on what the drink has to offer then when you crash its like hitting a wall mere hours later you get up and do the same thing all over again
4041370 i know a girl who was at her first year at guelph university and was literally never sleeping and partying all the time
4041371 her grades dropped drastically she was a really smart girl too
4041372 but im certainly not complaining about being on the road for me its like a fantasy come true
4041373 and thinking back i realize that was the point where i knew i was actually crazy enough to think i could have a career as a professional musician i was into lead belly for a while and then especially into mississippi john hurt i still am
4041374 my older sister helped me out with her credit card and i got on an airplane for the first time and headed for la
4041375 at music school i told my teacher who had managed joe jackson and worked with diane warren that i would do anything to learn how to write songs
4041376 i knew that was something i had to work on if i was going to get anywhere at that time i was pretty naive and didnt know who diane warren was even though i had heard many of the songs she had written so that was huge for me
4041377 working with swedish musicians was really interesting because theyre coming from a much more melodic point of view than i was with my blues based and rock influences
4041378 co writing with them was also great because theyre very honest and once they saw i was bringing something to the table they let me know they respected my ability
4041379 at the same time they werent shy at all about letting me know straight to the point that one of my song ideas wasnt cutting it
4041380 this feels more like our concert than any album weve done
4041381 i said that about time well wasted too but our live show has evolved and improved since then i think this album reflects what were capable of doing now
4041382 everyone who makes exciting music doesnt categorize what they do
4041383 we take whatever people need to call us as a steppingstone to our music
4041384 but i do come from a hip hop background thats what inspires me im putting rhythms and rhymes together so that rap element is a big element of it
4041385 but this band comes from all different directions we dont fit into one genre and neither do most people
4041386 the main thing is that donald and i wanted to make records and write songs in the 70s and touring was not nearly as fulfilling or as creative a process for us
4041387 im glad we stopped touring because we got as many albums done as we did because we had that much time and energy to put into it
4041388 it is hard to move on but it is the best possible thing for my career
4041389 it has honestly become impossible for me to continue both careers and it is very unfair to my employers to divide my time between them
4041390 its such a fun way to reconnect with the child inside you
4041391 theres the incredible sense of achievement you feel when you first learn to ride when you push those boundaries your parents set and start exploring other neighborhoods and places the moonlight ramble brings back those same feelings
4041392 its quite a sight watching this mass of humanity pedaling on
4041393 when youre riding back toward downtown with the full moon over the skyline i always feel like i live in one of the neatest cities in the world
4041394 the cw has no deal with tori spelling to appear on 90210 at this time
4041395 at this time there are no plans for tori to appear in the 90210 spinoff
4041396 we believe they need to come out of their partisan corners
4041397 we are going to have to see what the total package is
4041398 what the governor proposed i am not sure can be characterized as a tax increase
4041399 pharaoh neco made eliakim son of josiah king in place of his father josiah and changed eliakims name to jehoiakim
4041400 the king of babylon made mattaniah jehoiachins uncle king in his place and changed his name to zedekiah
4041401 now the lord god had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air he brought them to the man to see what he would name them and whatever the man called each living creature that was its name
4041402 rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground
4041403 the enemy pursues me crushes me to the ground makes me dwell in darkness like those long dead
4041404 if i say surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me even the darkness will not be dark to you the night will shine like the day for darkness is as light to you
4041405 dont set up any more meetings with governors it makes absolutely no sense to do this if we dont have stability in the incentive programs
4041406 sure well need wind and solar energy but its just not cost effective yet
4041407 is to accelerate the introduction of new technologies for energy supply and use and deploy them on a very large scale

4041471 your economists are saying we are in a period of uncertainty they keep saying we might be having a correction well falling off a cliff is not a correction
4041472 by correction they mean we are on the brink of economic disaster
4041473 the candidates the media nobody seems to get it were going to go into a major depression because of the excesses of the past seven years all of this wild spending we republicans have done since i took office as a fiscal conservative a tight fisted hard line budget man has undone us
4041474 yes we made a few little mistakes i thought iraq would cost us two trillion but its up to three trillion and counting
4041475 with low interest rates we encouraged the middle class to go out and enjoy a spending spree creating a housing boom and buying big screen tvs new cars and not pay attention to the war
4041476 now that the boom is over we have to have a bust because busts always follow booms thats part of the business cycle that even i learned about in econ 101 at yale without attending classes
4041477 and now we are in the bust cycle politicians dont want to talk about it even the guys on cnbc dont want to mention it in passing
4041478 instead of handing out stimulus checks wed be better off if we used the money to build new factories in this country

4041522 designed to secure both physical and virtual environments through a single management window such a solution helps security administrators rapidly implement policies software based access management is helping organisations protect their critical business assets and enabling them to focus key staff on strategic projects
4041523 if you layer thousands of security rules and access control lists over hundreds of internal firewalls and vlans it s easy to imagine the maintenance challenges organisations face

4041525 we had a tourism meeting a couple of weeks ago and everyone in the meeting expressed horror at the state of milloms christmas lights i understand that if we buy some of our own copeland borough council will install any that we happen to get
4041526 they sell off excess lights from blackpool illuminations and i think it would be a good idea to have a look to see what they have i think they would be a lot better than the ones we get from copeland council though we would have to fund them ourselves
4041527 it was very nice having the tree on the post office last year and i think we should extend on that we are thinking about putting a big tree up to make an impact when people come into millom

4041539 maar zelfs als je de buitenlanders buiten beschouwing laat dan scoren de belgische profvoetballers over het algemeen nog altijd niet beter dan hun amateurcollegas
4041540 koolhydraten zijn nochtans cruciaal en met speciaal aangepaste voeding kan je het suikergehalte in de spieren verdubbelen en ook pieken naar bepaalde dagen eerder onderzoek heeft echter aangewezen dat sommige voetballers zelfs met lagere gehaltes aan wedstrijden beginnen dan gewone mensen gevolg is dat hun prestaties in de tweede helft drastisch achteruit gaan
4041541 terwijl voldoende vocht opnemen voor en tijdens een wedstrijd doorslaggevend is bij 2 procent verlies aan lichaamsgewicht door vochtverlies verlies je immers 10 pct van je fysieke capaciteiten bij 5 procent is dat al 33 pct
4041542 voetballers overschatten ook het suikergehalte dat sportdranken zouden moeten hebben bovendien waren er maar liefst 22 profs die dachten dat red bull tijdens een wedstrijd best kan terwijl amper vijf amateurs hetzelfde idee hadden wie zon energiedrank tijdens een match drinkt krijgt kort nadien echter een ongelooflijke dip
4041543 sommige ploegen zorgen er wel voor dat hun spelers zoveel mogelijk op de club eten maar anderen doen dat behalve op wedstrijddagen helemaal niet bovendien eten heel wat spelers uiteraard ook thuis er is bijvoorbeeld nauwelijks sprake van op maat gemaakte di ten zoals bij europese topclubs wel het geval is

4041580 i just gain more and more confidence in him every day he had two big catches for me today one of them the 27 yarder he kind of got hit and held on to the ball hes doing a really good job and hes going to be a big part of this offense
4041581 if were really going and moving fast and have the tempo we need to be playing at the 40 second clock shouldnt even affect us
4041582 we should be able to get the snap off get set maybe even get checks in if we need it it shouldnt be that big a difference for us except hopefully itll speed up the other team and well get a few more plays in
4041583 he said with the 40 second clock dont treat it any different
4041584 just have great tempo and its not going to be an issue hes done preparation the same way he always has hes stressed tempo more than play clock or anything like that
4041585 i dont think everybody will do what our offense does
4041586 but we have to be ready to have a plan if everybody is as quick as our offense we have to have a separate plan to combat that

4041591 we believe the russians are consolidating their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia and will not significantly expand their ground presence in georgia
4041592 we believe the russians will fall back to their pre crisis boundaries we do expect russia to retain a military presence in both enclaves for the long term
4041593 we do see a halt to offensive military operations if there is a formal cease fire we believe the russians will adhere to it while reserving the right to use military force to respond to threats against their troops

4041601 well be looking at the effects of the earthquake on the ground and for evidence of what actually happened during the earthquake well be looking very closely at how the tectonic blocks actually moved in relation to each other
4041602 much of what actually happens during earthquakes is difficult to view because it occurs deep below the surface by looking at the way in which roads pipelines rivers and other man made markers are affected we can map out how the earth moved what faults were responsible and what kind of activity we might expect in future events
4041603 aftershocks are expected after every large earthquake and this has been no exception earthquakes release stress where they occur but they also cause increased stress in the surrounding rock and this additional pressure has to be released peak aftershock activity is generally in the first few days after the main quake and the number and size of aftershocks decreases rapidly after that
4041604 we are conscious of being as sensitive as possible while working in this area there is still a lot of recovery work going on and there are obvious long term infrastructural problems we hope to be able to visit the town of beichuan which was decimated by the earthquake but this will depend very much on the local authorities were very thankful to the sichuan provincial government for granting us access to the earthquake zone at such a critical time the location of the active faults is crucial we want to see if the faults that weve previously mapped were activated during the earthquake or if the quake occurred along a new set of faults knowing where the active faults lie and how much they are likely to move in future events can help the chinese authorities in planning new buildings and towns to reduce the likelihood of future casualties

4041732 personally i think norton is one of the most annoying programs ever created and its so hard to deal with
4041733 windows live onecare seemed to be over engineered and it created serious problems for us it seemed to randomly change the network settings on certain pcs without our knowledge and other so called brand name products were just as bad
4041734 our pcs are used for point of sale pos customer support and accounting so its vital that theyre fully protected pretty much every aspect of this business is dependent on our computers being up and running at all times a virus infection would effectively shut down the business
4041735 with a relatively small number of pcs hard costs are not a big issue for us
4041736 but soft costs like my time are extremely important so we really wanted to find an anti virus solution that would provide solid protection without needing a lot of administrative attention
4041737 through word of mouth i heard that some other small businesses were running avg and were very pleased with it

4041739 i sent walling data an email to get a price quote and we were happy with it
4041740 so i placed the order they helped us to deploy the software and it was all very quick and easy
4041741 i have had to take advantage of the free support a few times for minor things
4041742 walling data helped us to diagnose and fix the problems right then and there it was nice to be able to pick up the phone to solve an it problem on the spot especially considering the kind of time constraints i usually have
4041743 because we dont have a dedicated it department to handle software problems i was very happy to discover how easy avg was to manage
4041744 we have also found that avg doesnt have any impact on pc performance most of the time you dont even know its there and the price is fantastic
4041745 we were looking for something simple and unobtrusive that would keep our pcs secure without getting in our way and we found it in avg
4041746 the chaos theory tells us that chaotic systems are systems that look random but arent

4041750 as the world reaches a threshold with modern science and its failures to provide for a relaxed functional state of mind people are turning to old and ancient methods to achieve that paradigm until now nobody created a scientific meditation that held solid ground reflecting its mechanism and therapeutic effects
4041751 in this age of technology humans are likely to be challenged by the very advancement they desire such as autonomy of computers to achieve certain solutions which some people will find hard to accept and deal with which in turn will be detrimental to self esteem and confidence
4041752 in that situation it is only the relaxed mind healthy body creativity awareness of self and following correct principles that can compete with the challenge of artificial intelligence and society at large cognitive therapies like dr ajrawats air pulse autonomic meditation therapy air pulse meditation and dr ajrawats image therapy will be the scientific tools to keep modern generations on the cutting edge

4041785 i am in favor of a national health program that guarantees that no american is denied needed care the disparity in our health care system is looking more like that in a third world country every day

4041806 perhaps it is inevitable that we might see some decline in demand among less deeply committed organic consumers but this is more likely to be a plateau than a reverse
4041807 it doesnt make sense to cut back on what it is a very economical way of eating especially on food where you know where it has come from and you can trust it
4041808 we have enthusiastic customers and i dont think that when the bank statement arrives they will take the organic veg box off their list i am fundamentally optimistic

4041863 my department has contributed significant funding to the refurbishment and upgrading of this historic building
4041864 through this investment we are not only helping support and continually develop arts and culture in londonderry but we are also contributing to the economic and social development of the north west
4041865 the arts play a vital role in the cultural and economic life of northern ireland and help to bring in tourists and further investment
4041866 i wanted to see first hand the work in progress on site and view the recently installed staircase which leads to magnificent views of the city
4041867 when complete the playhouse will boast impressive modern facilities including a new box office an upgraded theatre disabled access and new catering facilities which will meet everyones needs
4041868 i look forward to visiting again when the new facility is completed in early 2009
4041869 i trust that the wider community will benefit from this impressive project and it will provide more opportunities for our young people to get involved in the arts
4041870 we have been under siege for the last two years
4041871 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
4041872 if the cease fire is just a front for extremists in gaza to rearm and regroup of course we have the right to act
4041873 any arms buildup is a direct violation of the calm that was achieved
4041874 they control the gaza strip with quite an iron fist if you dont mind me saying and none of this activity with the other groups would be happening unless hamas was complicit and allowing it to happen
4041875 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss

4041903 any fish in the water will be dead and any food and plant life will also be dead
4041904 niea is frustrated that to date we have not been able to identify who was responsible for releasing the pollutant into the river which caused this fish kill
4041905 while samples have been collected and analysed and a vast range of substances have been identified it is still not clear what actually caused this pollution incident
4041906 this incident has caused great distress to the local community including anglers using the river however someone knows who was responsible
4041907 i would therefore urge anyone whether they are at tonights meeting or not to come forward with any information they might have which can help the agency to identify the offender this can be done by contacting the niea water operations team or the water pollution hotline

4041918 chela didnt want to put the gloves on at first
4041919 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
4041920 political stability in my view can only be brought through a reconciliation approach as opposed to confrontation
4041921 the era of repression is over forever dictatorship has become a tale of the past
4041922 for political reconciliation general musharraf has to quit reconciliation is not possible without it

4041938 stark saw that it was a red card and theres nothing i can do about it
4041939 its extremely difficult in the third game of your group to get a red card four minutes in
4041940 it makes it hard to play your game and the whole lineup had to be reshaped the whole mentality just went in the trash
4041941 i think stark maybe rushed his decision a little bit in showing the red card but then its behind us of course it changed the game completely but we have to look at the bigger picture

4041949 ich habe bronze gewonnen nicht gold oder silber verloren ich wollte bei meinen ersten spielen unbedingt eine medaille jetzt bin ich super happy dass es geklappt hat
4041950 i thought they played really well they made a lot of first serves and missed hardly any returns we just didnt play well enough didnt serve well enough didnt return well enough and they just played much better
4041951 theyre really good and have beaten a lot of the best teams llodra has got a very good serve and he volleys well and clement is more solid from the baseline and returns great so as a team they play really well
4041952 we havent played together all that much they obviously played like guys that have played a lot of matches together maybe thats something that in the future well look to do before we play in the big events
4041953 when youre playing against a top team and go behind so early in both sets you need to try to stay with them and get on top of them and then you can play well but after we went behind we were sort of having to try and force things and started missing a few more shots and ultimately you dont play as well
4041954 i like to think id be able to put it behind me
4041955 it is unprofessional and disappointing on my part and again something that i need to learn from and make sure it doesnt happen again because i think ive been playing really well just now and the us open is my favourite tournament and i believe i can do really well there
4041956 ideally i would have liked to have got here earlier but i didnt because i played very well in cincinnati which is great but normally at each tournament i weigh myself at the start and i should have checked that as soon as i got here instead of the day after playing
4041957 and then you make sure that youre maintaining your weight not being dehydrated because there is a lot of humidity here and youre sweating more than normal
4041958 i didnt get here as early as i might have liked and i want to make sure that im over all the jet lag so i might go to the us open a little bit earlier and maybe get home for a couple of days before i leave to go to new york
4041959 i dont plan on celebrating just now i have some time after the us open to do that it was obviously a great week for me this was pretty disappointing im going to go and put some hours in on the court and in the gym and make sure that im 100 ready to go deep at the us open
4041960 i think we just missed out on getting seeded by one spot and that could have made a bit of a difference as you can avoid some of the best teams we played two top teams so it was always going to be tough for us to get through but if we had managed to come through this match which obviously we didnt we would have had a decent shot at medalling
4041961 after being part of the olympics for the first time and seeing what its like when the athletes win medals and how big a deal it is you realise how much you want to do well
4041962 well be playing at home on one of my and jamies best surfaces as were going to play on grass at wimbledon and also doubles as well is a lot about experience were very young in comparison to a lot of the top teams and hopefully come 2012 well have a bit more experience
4041963 were very lucky to get the chance to play together in some of the biggest events in the world but ideally when you go on court you want to feel very comfortable with each other comfortable with how youre going to play and feeling that you know each others movements but we havent played enough together to feel like that so in that respect its really difficult
4041964 i made a goal this year to get into the masters cup and id be pretty disappointed if i didnt make it now i only have to win a few more matches before the end of the year to do that
4041965 but youve also got to try and look at the bigger picture as well

4041979 it is a big chance for him he had an unsuccessful season last year because he was injured at birmingham it took him a while to get back nearly until the end of the season
4041980 but dont forget he is still only 21 and for a central defender that is very young and he has already had many appearances in europe
4041981 it is always tricky when you have players coming back late you always try to rush the fitness a little bit
4041982 but i dont panic because we have worked very hard to build up these young players for example djourou will play he has been with us for three or four years
4041983 if he cannot play one game when we need him then we are wasting our time

4042125 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4042126 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

4042275 maar zelfs als je de buitenlanders buiten beschouwing laat dan scoren de belgische profvoetballers over het algemeen nog altijd niet beter dan hun amateurcollegas
4042276 koolhydraten zijn nochtans cruciaal en met speciaal aangepaste voeding kan je het suikergehalte in de spieren verdubbelen en ook pieken naar bepaalde dagen eerder onderzoek heeft echter aangewezen dat sommige voetballers zelfs met lagere gehaltes aan wedstrijden beginnen dan gewone mensen gevolg is dat hun prestaties in de tweede helft drastisch achteruit gaan
4042277 terwijl voldoende vocht opnemen voor en tijdens een wedstrijd doorslaggevend is bij 2 procent verlies aan lichaamsgewicht door vochtverlies verlies je immers 10 pct van je fysieke capaciteiten bij 5 procent is dat al 33 pct
4042278 voetballers overschatten ook het suikergehalte dat sportdranken zouden moeten hebben bovendien waren er maar liefst 22 profs die dachten dat red bull tijdens een wedstrijd best kan terwijl amper vijf amateurs hetzelfde idee hadden wie zon energiedrank tijdens een match drinkt krijgt kort nadien echter een ongelooflijke dip
4042279 sommige ploegen zorgen er wel voor dat hun spelers zoveel mogelijk op de club eten maar anderen doen dat behalve op wedstrijddagen helemaal niet bovendien eten heel wat spelers uiteraard ook thuis er is bijvoorbeeld nauwelijks sprake van op maat gemaakte di ten zoals bij europese topclubs wel het geval is
4042280 te meer omdat ik merkte dat heel wat profs en overigens ook veel amateurs echt wel vragende partij zijn voor meer en betere informatie

4042317 if theyre not going to do anything right then there are a lot of us who arent going to go
4042318 they need to be more serious about it and take care of their players if that changes i would definitely consider playing but this is very serious if im going to do my best then i expect the other people involved to do the same if not then ill just sit home and get ready for the season
4042319 in this case some of the city council felt strongly about it and i think weve arrived at a reasonable balance will it make an appreciable difference no but it will cut some usage
4042320 now i hear theyre going to exempt small stores which makes no sense at all
4042321 everything has been early then nothing to get double digit runs means that a lot of people contributed offensively and thats huge for us
4042322 its still a little sore but i felt better than i have the past couple of weeks
4042323 i went out there and did just enough with the way the score being what it was it was a good time to only go five innings

4042401 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
4042402 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
4042403 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4042404 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4042405 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4042406 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
4042407 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
4042408 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
4042409 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4042410 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4042411 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4042412 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4042413 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to
4042414 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police
4042415 those responsible for planting these devices show a callous disregard for human life
4042416 those responsible seem intent on following their own selfish agenda and the only way for communities to be free from such activity is to help officers bring these criminals before the courts
4042417 there was no claim of responsibility but dissident republicans were suspected of being responsible the devices were being examined
4042418 formal consultation on equality impact assessment eqia of northside urban village draft regeneration framework
4042419 the dup was relentlessly trying to interfere in the uup tory talks and would not be ditching its support and links with the order
4042420 party policy for the rest of the uk has to reflect different situations in other regions unlike northern ireland most parts of gb do not have a selection based post primary system therefore party policy has to reflect different local circumstances
4042421 enceladus has got warmth water and organic chemicals some of the essential building blocks needed for life
4042422 we have quite a recipe for life on our hands but we have yet to find the final ingredient liquid water but enceladus is only whetting our appetites for more
4042423 unfortunately from a republican perspective there are two different jurisdictions and two different economies and two different realities on the island
4042424 the major question historians will ask is not why the republicans surrendered but why they fought such a futile long war
4042425 it has not been unconditional surrender and it has been infinitely better than continuing to fight a futile war for the sake of honouring irelands dead yet producing only more of them but let us not labour under any illusions that the conditions were good

4042429 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4042430 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4042431 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4042432 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4042433 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4042434 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4042435 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4042436 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4042437 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4042438 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4042439 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4042440 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4042441 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4042442 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4042456 during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked us to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes
4042457 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture

4042468 more likely to investigate ethnic minority lawyers than white ones
4042469 plagued by a leadership that lacks competence on diversity issues
4042470 potentially this still leaves the sra open to the charge of institutional racism as its policies procedures practices and actions however unintended can be seen to have disproportionate detrimental and discriminatory outcomes for bme black and minority ethnic solicitors
4042471 not to be under estimated is the level of prejudice and bias which exists among personnel in this and other similar organisations
4042472 black and minority solicitors faced racism this is as serious for the legal profession as the lawrence inquiry was for racism in the metropolitan police
4042473 the report clearly demonstrates that the sra has not learnt the lessons of the 2006 initial impact assessment and continues to disproportionally target bme lawyers and solicitors in all facets of its regulatory work the sra appears to be incapable of putting its own house in order token lip service to equality and diversity is not the way to dispel allegations of institutional racism radical root reform is required as a matter of urgency
4042474 ethnic lawyers more likely to be investigated for irregularities of course its

4042531 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4042532 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4042533 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4042534 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
4042535 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
4042536 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
4042537 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
4042538 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
4042539 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
4042540 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

4042564 bagi tiap tiap sesuatu itu ada pembersihnya dan pembersih badan kasar jasad ialah puasa
4042565 ada tiga golongan yang tidak ditolak doa mereka yaitu orang yang berpuasa sampai ia berbuka kepala negara yang adil dan orang yang teraniaya
4042566 sesungguhnya orang yang berpuasa diwaktu ia berbuka tersedia doa yang makbul
4042567 barang siapa berpuasa di bulan ramadhan karena iman dan perhitungannya mengharapkan keridlaan allah maka diampunilah dosa dosanya
4042568 sesungguhnya di dalam surga ada sebuah pintu yang disebut dengan rayyan pada hari kiamat orang orang yang berpuasa akan masuk surga dari pintu itu tidak seorangpun masuk dari pintu itu selain mereka mereka dipanggil mana orang yang berpuasa lalu mereka berdiri setelah mereka itu masuk pintu segera dikunci maka tidak seorangpun lagi yang dapat masuk

4042590 keadaan kenisah rakyat jadi sedemikian menekan isi khotbah jim jones dan perilakunya sangat bertentangan sehingga tidak mungkin jemaatnya tidak bisa melihat hal ini dan mempertanyakan gerejanya tapi keraguan ini ditekan tiada yang mendukung ketidaktaatan terhadap perintah perintah sang pemimpin dan tiada kawan yang menyatakan ketidaksetujuan dengan mayoritas jemaat yang tidak taat dan menentang dengan cepat dihukum mempertanyakan kata kata jones atau bahkan keluarga dan teman temannya saja sudah berbahaya orang yang menyadap pembicaraan dengan cepat melaporkan segala pertentangan dan bahkan anggota anggota keluarga sendiri pun melakukan hal ini
4042591 ini tidak hanya menghilangkan sikap menentang tapi juga menghilangkan sikap solidaritas dan kesetiaan orang terhadap sanak keluarga dan kawan kawan mereka sendiri

4042595 frankly we were blown away by both the volume and quality of the names that were submitted
4042596 g8 st was one of the most popular suggestions plus we noticed a far broader trend toward simple easy to remember names
4042597 in the end we felt it was more appropriate to honor the el caminos unique place as part of chevys heritage and not use that nameplate on a pontiac

4042609 i think that most companies lack the skills to add internet collaboration tools to their environments particularly those that have traditionally focused on back end processing rather than front end applications
4042610 they are beginning to hire younger people who have the skills but they still need the corporate blessing to do something with them in the short term they usually hire some geeks from a company that has three people to help develop the applications
4042611 we have seen renewed interest in all things internet as a result of web 2 0 technologies but the kind of training people are asking for is less about understanding the issues and applications involved and more about effective communication and why and what is effective rather than how to do it
4042612 it is a new course area so was always going to be a bit more popular but we have noticed a lot of demand for podcasting which is surprising because it is almost an old technology for web 2 0 though people ask for videocasting as well

4042622 the car title for jack duh you sold him your car when we got married you said we didnt need two cars now rick you said you were alright with this that you agreed that your old car had seen better days and that you didnt mind us using my car for awhile
4042623 you have to sign it in front of the title people at the government office thingy where jack will get the car put in his own name duh

4042631 our aim is to create a mosaic of the best and the brightest faculty across all our schools and in all our disciplines a mosaic including rising stars interested in becoming part of the intellectual life of this great institution
4042632 a mixture of a weaker us dollar and stronger commodity prices helped buoy the aussie dollar
4042633 domestic developments played second fiddle to the aussie dollars price action
4042634 weve had very volatile moves so im sure that theres a fair amount of investor caution out there
4042635 that will set the tone for the next 24 hours
4042636 certainly if euro zone gdp surprises on the downside and there is any sign of cpi inflation peaking then that would give the us dollar fresh impetus and that would see the aussie dollar back down towards yesterdays lows
4042637 it is worth pointing out that alone in 2008 between jan 1 and july 15 the iwf carried out more than 1 200 in and out of competition tests in 104 countries around the world
4042638 therefore we reject such statements bringing our sport into disrepute
4042639 with income being squeezed in so many ways those looking to raise some extra money may find that their spare room could provide the answer
4042640 demand for rooms is likely to be fairly high too and with the government providing tax free incentives for landlords now is certainly a good time for those considering taking in a lodger
4042641 obviously thats a little harder to police when people are in private apartments but people shouldnt take any comfort from that
4042642 if police can identify you they can make a charge
4042643 you can have a lot of fun without turning off international visitors and spectators
4042644 theres plenty of room for fun and i think we can do that without crossing the line into a place where maybe mums and dads dont feel good about bringing their children here

4042649 the reserve bank will be delighted with yet another indicator showing that wage pressures remain under control
4042650 another barrier has been cleared for a rate cut possibly as early as next month
4042651 the fact that they didnt suggests that it is a precautionary cut back in spending rather than a really forced cut back
4042652 i think the reserve bank takes a very eclectic look at wages growth now it puts all the different measures in the box
4042653 when you do that it doesnt suggest that theres anything too alarming going on

4042675 average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5 and 10 so a 30 loss is deeply worrying this spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers
4042676 we dont know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality
4042677 30 fewer honeybee colonies could therefore cost the economy some 50m and put at risk the governments crusade for the public to eat five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day
4042678 if the bee disappears from the surface of the earth man would have no more than four years to live no more bees no more pollination no more men

4042729 the goal i would say is that all the powers that be the church and the government make sure that people children know their history and their roots
4042730 faith in god is as important for every human as the root for a tree
4042731 but our tree unfortunately has died just like a human soul can die without doing good this is what happens to people who do not do good things and do not follow gods laws
4042732 have shown us how one must live to be close to god

4042758 it is a little unnerving having it there when we do not know what it is
4042759 it is making webs like funnels and it looks nothing like a house or garden spider we have ever seen before we think it might be related to the black widow spider family but we cannot be sure
4042760 it has made its home in the porch and doesnt really seem to be going anywhere but it gives me the creeps i cant stand spiders and i am just a little worried for the childrens safety until i can be assured that it wont bite
4042761 it has been there for a few months now and we all have to just check where it is before we leave the house it has now hidden behind the gas meter but you can just see its legs sticking out
4042762 most spiders over here are hairy but this one is really shiny none of us have seen anything like it
4042763 we have taken a picture and we really just wanted to know if anyone with any knowledge of spiders could identify it for us and just reassure us that it is not poisonous
4042764 we have been looking on the internet but we cant quite find anything that really matches it
4042765 if anyone out there can help we really would like to know
4042766 we stayed at a hotel right on the dartford tunnel and there was an accident there
4042767 i knew being familiar with the bridge that there would be traffic there and it could have taken us an hour to get from the hotel to the tunnel but our driver phoned through
4042768 we got there with an hour and 15 minutes to spare but with my mentality thats 15 minutes
4042769 we had travelled on the sunday to nottingham forest we had the traffic last night and i dont think anyone would have welcomed another 30 minutes although you would have said that if there had been extra time they possibly would have been favourites all in all im well pleased to be in the next round

4042780 there are a lot of good strikers here with leroy lita and kevin doyle up front with their movement and strength and pace
4042781 and there is shane long who is exceptionally good he has so much in his bag
4042782 it is going to be a hard task to get in the side
4042783 i think i have to be a bit patient im trying to find my feet and we have two very good strikers up front and shane
4042784 its very good competition and will keep all the boys on their toes but i will work harder get stronger faster and sharper
4042785 it is different to score in competitive football compared to a friendly
4042786 its great to score your first goal for the club and to get it on my debut was very pleasing
4042787 i was disappointed with my first effort off the crossbar so i wasnt going to pull out of that one and i managed to put it away
4042788 i didnt realise how late it was and i thought we had a bit more time than that but i always thought wed win it if we got the chance
4042789 in the last 15 minutes we pushed on and were strong and thats down to our fitness coach and his methods he is very professional in the preparation and it will show by the end of the season hopefully
4042790 it was tough going 100 miles an hour their formation made it hard to get a hold on the game but my old pal smith made a really good save
4042791 after having them run around happily in bare feet on the grassy meadow my eldest called out to me mummy theres some glass here
4042792 it was inside the swing park itself and all around the entrance gate it was horrific the worst was that as it had been thrown in the grass the razor sharp shards were semi concealed and could so easily have sliced their feet or knees to shreds
4042793 im just thankful my daughter spotted it it took me and another local dad who arrived later to walk his dog an hour to clear it up
4042794 it was blatant vandalism and the total disregard for the safety of the little children who use the park that really made my blood boil
4042795 i thought geoff miller chief england selector was only calling me about the england lions games
4042796 i cannot stress enough how much i want to get out there and play for england
4042797 we cant get drugs to you we cant figure out a decent vaccine um cutting off your foreskin kinda helps maybe use a cheese grater to get you some more scar tissue
4042798 removal of the prepuce makes masturbation significantly more difficult which is why it was adopted as a routine practice in the first place it significantly alters the sexual experience
4042799 my point was that circumcision makes masturbation significantly more difficult you cite a study that found that 80 of adult men circumsized in one study found some additional difficulty in masturbating but that doesnt support my point
4042800 what about removing just the clitoral hood or maybe even just a small part of it is that ok
4042801 yet your posting history here indicates youve done nothing but promote the practice from the get go
4042802 circed men frequently use lubricant for example something uncirced men dont need
4042803 your argument seems to consist mainly of your refusal to accept that your penis might not actually work as well as it might have
4042804 cutting off a forth of the skin on a erogenous sexual organ
4042805 circed men frequently use lubricant for example something uncirced men dont need
4042806 indeed sometimes people dont let the medical statistics guide their behavior at all
4042807 point 1 is unusual most of the studies ive read indicate a much smaller difference but the actual rate in both groups is very small
4042808 that puts point 2 in which the rate of utis is raised to nearly 50 in stark contrast
4042809 169 children with uti 56 males and 113 females born in israel from 1979 to 1984
4042810 using numbers from the literature one can estimate that 7 to 14 of 1000 uncircumcised male infants will develop a uti during the first year of life compared with 1 to 2 of 1000 circumcised male infants
4042811 quite simply some of the circumcision advocates here have suggested that cutting the uti rate by half or two thirds is worth cutting off parts of the penis yet when circumcision is practiced in a particular and fairly common way it vastly increases the rate of utis by far more than a factor of two or three or ten
4042812 that pattern doesnt match the normal rates of uti contraction leading to the speculation that the period during which a circumcision is done matters
4042813 the early circumcisions acted as triggers for the development of utis infections which we might reasonably expect could be avoided if the timing were changed
4042814 1 general knowledge that utis while more likely during the period when an infants immune system is not fully active and when breastfeeding is de emphasized are not so unevenly spread
4042815 2 the researchers in the cited study speculated that timing might be an issue
4042816 i could have looked for the actual data but it wasnt necessary and as it happens you looked up some of the relevant data yourself in the study you cited what percentage of the utis among males took place within the first month
4042817 manapio you have once again managed to completely miss the point throughout the first year of life of the male infants who developed utis in the study 48 of the utis occurred in a specific time period that represented about 4 of the total time that pattern doesnt match the normal rates of uti contraction leading to the speculation that the period during which a circumcision is done matters
4042818 after the immediate postcircumcision period the incidence rate of uti dropped to a level comparable to that reported among circumcised male infants in the united states this study suggests that the method and the timing of circumcision also may be important factors to consider
4042819 yet when circumcision is practiced in a particular and fairly common way it vastly increases the rate of utis by far more than a factor of two or three or ten
4042820 since such clumping isnt found after later circumcisions timing may be an issue
4042821 i notice that youve ignored the points about the prepuce being richly supplied with sensory nerve endings may i ask why
4042822 would you say that theres no objective need for the penis then
4042823 why have you repeatedly suggested that the israeli study involved ritual circumcision
4042824 would you say that theres no objective need for the penis then
4042825 but i think with the available evidence its simply not a medically necessary surgery in most cases
4042826 quantifying pleasure is notoriously difficult which is probably why youre hiding behind such claims qualitatively
4042827 common sense strongly suggests its more important than you seem set on declaring it to be
4042828 do you have a source for that claim that quality of reasoning is precisely what ive come to expect from you
4042829 seth manapio would you mind explaining to me how you would go about making a sex toy that would mimic an intact penis
4042830 one final note on this topic the study which points to reduced hiv rates due to male circumcision was seriously flawed as are most
4042831 the association between circumcision and aids began in 1986 when the late california urologist and circumcision promoter aaron j fink proposed that the keratinization damage caused by male circumcision would prevent hiv infection
4042832 a number of studies on the subject have been conducted in africa since that time
4042833 although results from studies linking male circumcision and aids are conflicting
4042834 in kenya and uganda show that male circumcision has a 48 53 protective effect against hiv over a 14 month period
4042835 the previously published auvert study concluded that circumcision reduced hiv transmission in south african men by 63 over a period of 21 months but that study was widely criticized for having a number of easily spotted flaws in methodology and for its overly optimistic conclusions
4042836 the multi country mishra study concluded that circumcision may actually increase transmission of the aids virus
4042837 with age education wealth status and a number of sexual and other behavioral risk factors controlled statistically in only one of the eight countries were circumcised men at a significant advantage in the other seven countries the association between circumcision and hiv status was not statistically significant for the male population as a whole we find a protective effect of circumcision in only one of the eight countries for which there are nationally representative hiv seroprevalence data
4042838 there is a large body of literature indicating that male circumcision has a protective effect against hiv infection however not all studies find this effect
4042839 the relationship between female circumcision and aids has also been studied with similar conflicting results the stallings study found that female circumcision reduces transmission of the aids virus while other studies have shown that it increases transmission
4042840 the united states has one of the highest rates of male circumcision and also one of the highest rates of hiv infection in the developed world suggesting that circumcision is having exactly the opposite effect
4042841 circumcision of infants and boys for any reason other than a clear compelling and immediate medical need is sexual assault
4042842 will doctors ever begin promoting female circumcision as a way to help prevent aids its a very real possibility if physicians are successful in convincing governments to allow boys and infants to be forcefully circumcised as part of the war on aids it may only be a matter of time before other doctors use the stallings study to justify circumcising girls for the same reason
4042843 since i am cut ill never know but by all accounts the foreskin makes a huge difference in sensitivity
4042844 some of the teams that come along have been turning up since the start they get a great lunch the course is absolutely superb and theres no pressure on them thats why it goes on so well
4042845 i was part of kens chairmans committee and when he put forward the idea of doing it all i can say is that i was quite vocal in his support
4042846 a lot of people thought it wouldnt work and were a little bit negative about it but both ken and i had a very positive approach and here we are 13 years later and it is going from strength to strength
4042847 we are contributing to the coffers of the charity and having a great deal of fun at the same time so i think we can deem this to be a big success and hugely enjoyable
4042848 for the first time in my life ive finally got a full time job which is ironic really as all my friends are retiring and here i am going to work every day
4042849 ive got it back to front but im not complaining i enjoy my job thoroughly and i do enjoy going to work despite 40 years of being in the business
4042850 i would play off 13 i learned to play when i was very young but didnt play for the next 25 years
4042851 over the past few years ive adapted my game to the point where i have a comparatively low expectation
4042852 i dont hit the ball anywhere near as far as i used to but i know how to play and on my day i can play to single figures
4042853 good looking very attractive sadly not very good players but im not bothered because im the envy of every other man here and that cant be bad
4042854 this is my third charity golf day this week there was cheltenham on monday with the taverners tuesday with the variety club and now sonning so its great and this time of year you can play when you want
4042855 the taverners are great people they do so much good work every penny they raise goes to the charity and its a great day out
4042856 my pal is tony johnson the former south african pro and hes just turned 50 and gone on the seniors tour
4042857 he went for his first seniors match and they gave him his card and it had three crosses on it
4042858 the plate has to stay in for six months but well see how things go for the next seven days or so and after that well all have a better idea of when i can return
4042859 i hope to be back in 3 4 weeks but well have to see how it goes
4042860 we always try to change the captain every two years and its good to have a change and a different type of captain
4042861 gavins a very organised individual and has great respect from the boys and we have to find a way of putting in a more consistent performance without losing flair and i think gavin will do that
4042862 just avoiding relegation was not the position i ever want to be in again
4042863 we should be competing for the top honours and thats what ive always strived to do during all my years in south west 1
4042864 ive rarely finished below third or fourth so to finish ninth last year was disappointing
4042865 so theres lots to build on and i think thats why theyve been looking for a new captain
4042866 weve certainly got a good exciting set of backs its just getting our forwards a little bit more drilled and a little bit more street wise
4042867 the players have to step up and be a bit more responsible this season
4042868 the club have introduced a pay scheme so the players will now be getting rewarded for their efforts and i think that in turn requires a lot more commitment from the players to keep themselves in good shape
4042869 last season we realised we were not putting in the effort youve got to keep going to the gym youve got to put in those little runs on a sunday morning wednesday monday and the odd friday
4042870 if you can do something before work and get down the gym and do a bit and you ll see the benefits
4042871 if we do that those games we lost last season by five or 10 points next season well win them and thats the difference between finishing bottom and top of the table
4042872 its getting that mentality into the players and making them realise that if they want success then they have to work for it
4042873 weve really hammered them this year and the boys are looking seriously fit
4042874 cctv com und safenet arbeiteten bereits im juni im rahmen eines testlaufs zur bertragung der fu ball europameisterschaft 2008 erfolgreich zusammen safenet konnte alle sicherheitsanforderungen erf llen und wurde deshalb ausgew hlt auch die online bertragung der olympischen spiele in peking zu sch tzen

4042936 on his second album with producer rick rubin songwriter neil diamond seems to have found himself to a degree not evident on his other

4042944 let me sing and im happy the annaversary song etc etc
4042945 i am thrilled that we have been able to assemble a board of quite staggering expertise
4042946 every member of the board knows that the decisions they take will potentially impact on millions of lives and they know that i am determined to ensure the new mayoralty differs from the last by listening to londoners and then acting on what they say
4042947 there are eight million experts on getting round london living in our city and their opinions will be crucial in helping us provide the capital with a transport system that is safe pleasant and easy to use
4042948 these figures help to dispel the myth that two tier parking penalty systems will result in meltdown they clearly show there has been no evidence of this in london
4042949 people told us in our consultation that motorists who selfishly endanger lives and cause the most disruption to others should receive a heavier penalty than those committing a lesser contravention it is only right that the focus of any enforcement is structured in this way
4042950 motorists are often irritated to find they have been issued with a ticket but the simple message is if you dont break the rules you will not get one
4042951 i would also remind anyone who feels they should not have received a ticket that they have the right to appeal to the independent parking and traffic appeals service who have the final say in every disputed case
4042952 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
4042953 every so often the rearrangements may be advantageous those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
4042954 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
4042955 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
4042956 sorry maar mijn persoonlijke filosofische overtuiging de overtuiging dat wij mensen niet actief levens mogen be indigen laat mij niet toe uw verzoek in te willigen ik kan daarom geen toestemming tot actieve euthanasie geven
4042957 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a trade off strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
4042958 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
4042959 sleep is a smart sophisticated process you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of
4042960 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
4042961 patients with cardiovascular disease shouldnt exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels on very polluted days they should consider staying inside and during the winter they should limit exposure to fireplace smoke of course the real solution is to reduce air pollution
4042962 the poor who sell their organs are being exploited whether by richer people within their own countries or by transplant tourists from abroad
4042963 the legacy of transplantation must not be the impoverished victims of organ trafficking and transplant tourism but rather a celebration of the gift of health by one individual to another
4042964 there was some interest in converting syngas into ethanol during the first oil crisis back in the 70s the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the by products they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
4042965 if we can increase this activated co adsorption on the surface of the catalyst it improves the opportunity for the formation of ethanol molecules and if we can increase the amount of surface area for the catalyst we can increase the amount of ethanol produced
4042966 gasification to ethanol has received increasing attention as an attractive approach to reaching the federal renewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons of biofuel
4042967 in the near future sentry will conduct high resolution oceanographic surveys that would be otherwise impossible
4042968 we had tested the auv as best we could before we got out here but the steep terrain of the deep sea is quite a different matter

4043002 taking into consideration the role of the media in society which is to entertain educate and inform the media tends to sensationalise rather than educate society as regards the overall development of africa
4043003 i advocate the notion that the media should be a watchdog of society but i oppose the notion that the media should be sensational in order to increase sales and nullify the professional code of conduct this demotes values of the profession that some of us hold passionately
4043004 the media alters peoples perceptions about things and the negative perceptions that many people have about our continent are as a result of the bad stories they are fed by our own media on the continent

4043015 i had this lover who didnt appeal to me at first
4043016 he was much older than me and i had only young lovers of my age before him yet hes the best lover ive ever had and i wouldnt have bet that the first time i saw him okay i had a lot of stereotypes about older men and he proved me wrong
4043017 yes i was surprised but in the wrong way i thought he would be a great lover he has a reputation of a sensual one but when we had sex he was more focused on his performance than on giving me pleasure how disappointing
4043018 no i must have a sixth sense for that because ive never been disappointed by one of my lovers but i turned down some pretenders and i would never know if they would have made a great lover i dont regret anything

4043043 a mixture of a weaker us dollar and stronger commodity prices helped buoy the aussie dollar
4043044 domestic developments played second fiddle to the aussie dollars price action
4043045 weve had very volatile moves so im sure that theres a fair amount of investor caution out there
4043046 that will set the tone for the next 24 hours
4043047 certainly if euro zone gdp surprises on the downside and there is any sign of cpi inflation peaking then that would give the us dollar fresh impetus and that would see the aussie dollar back down towards yesterdays lows

4043066 good point i agree that its funny how she didnt walk out until he had an affair he has a job so its not like he was there holding her captive 24 7 it sounds like she may not have been as much a victim as shes claiming it could be that shes too lazy to clean and that shes just as guilty of child neglect as the husband but shes pi ed off because hes having an affair and is blaming it all on him

4043070 dius research found that four million people are considering or willing to consider participating in higher education these are people who are likely to be already in work they may have family commitments and perhaps missed out on the opportunity to go to university the first time around there may be others who now consider quite wrongly that their time has passed
4043071 the he work team has an in depth understanding of higher level learning coupled with direct experience of employers needs and the issues they face in relation to workforce development
4043072 this makes the organization well placed to develop practical workable solutions which will benefit individuals businesses and the uk economy as a whole
4043073 the importance of workplace learning has been overlooked for too long businesses contain a wealth of knowledge and expertise and there is no reason why the workplace cannot become the preferred location for post graduate achievement establishing organisations as validated locations of higher level learning would reinforce the brand names of the businesses concerned and help to make them employers of choice a critical differentiation in the war for talent
4043074 the dius report identifies the need for higher level skills in order for uk plc to remain competitive our own research indicates that employees are looking for opportunities to develop professionally through education and training in the workplace there is a clear call to action here
4043075 we look forward to working with employers to help increase productivity and improve retention by maximising the untapped potential within their workforces

4043111 we have developed a new vaccine that is extremely safe easy to administer and which rapidly builds protection against hepatitis b infection
4043112 the same vaccine platform has also been shown to elicit significant immune responses in animal studies with influenza anthrax smallpox rsv and hiv plans are under way to begin testing in humans
4043113 patients who lack cellular immunity can build up the needed antibodies to eradicate viral particles in the blood and interstitial fluid but they may not be able to remove infected cells where the virus hides
4043114 this is often the case with chronically infected patients so our vaccine may be of particular benefit to this population of immune compromised individuals
4043115 this positive review is an important milestone for bioms and our partner eli lilly and company and moves us one step closer to our goal of bringing this important therapy to multiple sclerosis patients
4043116 we are pleased by the results of the interim analysis and look forward to final efficacy and safety data from this trial next year
4043117 if successful this novel therapy administered only twice per year could help a large underserved population with late stage ms
4043118 we are not playing the way wed like to play
4043119 the first match was a good standard then we couldnt keep the standard we were fighting hard for the wins
4043120 its important to focus on the present this is a young team but weve behaved maturely and it happened naturally were able to handle things
4043121 i didnt feel sharp the last time i pitched here
4043122 i wanted to be aggressive and stay aggressive that really worked out i feel like if i stick to my game plan it sets me up for success
4043123 his last two outings are as good as ive seen him in a long time hes always been a winner
4043124 i felt tired before the competition but after it i feel relaxed
4043125 i thought a month ago if i would get this medal i would be every emotional
4043126 but im really not because we won the team gold medal
4043127 we have been working hard for eight years for this medal
4043128 but he handled it like a champion and i respect him very much

4043131 we find it all the more regrettable to have to inform you
4043132 that we will be ending our cooperation with wadi starting in february march 2009 the grounds for our decision concern the political positions taken by wadi on the middle east conflict

4043145 neither one of us is a slacker we like to move into the future and the only way to progress is to do it its easy to sit behind your desk and say id like to make things better but its another thing to get out from behind your desk and try to make things happen
4043146 hes great at what he does he knows the programs better than anybody ive ever seen

4043148 i see us using all of our assets with our history and the river
4043149 its something that hasnt really happened in the past we want to bring in lots of tourists i think we have a lot to offer
4043150 basically what we want is a raised boardwalk with a pavilion a picnic area maybea bird sanctuary because we have a wooded area that goes through there
4043151 sort of a river walk with public boat access to the river and public boat docks so people can stop and visit the park

4043161 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4043162 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4043163 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4043164 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4043165 i was really surprised i didnt think we would get it back
4043166 were all glad to get it back and we appreciate what the rcmp did to get it back and the man who dropped it off
4043167 my guess is whoever did take it would have heard it on the news somehow and then they put it there hoping someone would see it and pick it up
4043168 i think its very nice of them to do that really
4043169 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4043170 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4043171 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4043172 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4043173 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4043174 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4043175 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4043176 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4043177 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4043178 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4043179 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4043180 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4043181 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4043182 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4043183 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4043184 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4043185 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4043186 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4043187 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4043188 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4043189 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4043190 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4043191 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

4043223 f r die sinkende wirtschaftsleistung sind r ckl ufige konsumausgaben und geringe investitionen verantwortlich
4043224 die linke fordert seit langem die masseneinkommen zu st rken um konsum besch ftigung und investitionen zu st tzen und sich nicht wie die gro e koalition allein auf die weltkonjunktur zu verlassen die aktuelle situation zeigt dass der export allein die abw rtsspirale von sinkenden einkommen r ckl ufigen verbrauch und entsprechend geringen investitionen nicht auffangen kann der historisch hohe anstieg der verbraucherpreise belastet die einkommen der privaten haushalte zus tzlich und macht ein wirtschaftspolitisches gegensteuern umso dringlicher die privaten haushalte m ssen kurzfristig mit der ausgabe von steuerschecks entlastet werden diese steuerschecks sollen haushalten mit niedrigen und mittleren einkommen zu gute kommen zudem sind mehr ffentliche investitionen in infrastruktur bildung und forschung erforderlich um den konjunkturellen abw rtstrend zu stoppen deutschland kann sich nicht l nger leisten mit die niedrigsten ffentlichen ausgaben aller industriestaaten zu t tigen
4043225 der jamtruck ist f r die stadt essen eine enorme kulturelle bereicherung

4043227 mit diesem projekt soll gleichzeitig die idee von kultureller bildungsarbeit mit benachteiligten jugendlichen als gesellschaftlich relevante aufgabe verstanden und umgesetzt werden

4043232 besides our parents for us kids we had him he was the person we went to if we needed anything

4043234 i feel safe with him as a policeman in the neighborhood
4043235 she seemed like a very sweet outgoing and professional person whenever she was in court a very cheerful person
4043236 we made her a female so shes be easier to handle
4043237 no we want this half human alien killer to be a woman who kills men in order to reproduce so we have to make her a blondie type to get the men to sleep with her

4043240 het idee staat niet in de ijskast temeer daar de actuele reisinformatie voor onze klanten de basis is van onze plannen pas als we een plan hebben kunnen we subsidie aanvragen maar ook als wij een plan hebben is dat niet een twee drie geregeld

4043242 oil exports will begin when the pipeline is repaired the fighting is not an obstacle for exports
4043243 it is still exporting into turkey what has been suspended is the pumping at the baku end the shah deniz is pumping far less in at that end
4043244 we have checked those and there are no reports of any impact to any of the pipelines
4043245 we have started training villagers children and young people on what action should be taken to control forest fires
4043246 in 3 500 villages vulnerable to fires villagers especially children young people hunters and shepherds are provided with training to control fires also as part of a broad scale program public awareness activities are being held
4043247 in 2008 it was attempted to control fires with the use of 818 pumps 152 dozers 35 loaders 126 bulldozers 72 water tankers 82 caravans 114 trailers 366 field vehicles 717 motorcycles 17 helicopters 11 of which were rented 15 turkish airlines planes two amphibic planes and 11 000 fire workers
4043248 but if nothing concrete comes out of this visit turkey will only have earned accusations for legitimizing a leader who calls for destruction of a close strategic partner and who denies the holocaust
4043249 some in the u s and israeli administrations prefer hitting iran but the repercussion in the region will be terrible in case of an attack
4043250 the gap this time around between the proposals of p5 1 and the iranian position is narrower compared to the past we are trying to play a role of facilitator in order to bridge that gap
4043251 turkeys influence in the nuclear row is limited it is too much to expect a great deal from turkey in this affair
4043252 iranians know that there are groups in both the u s and israel administration that want to employ military force before george bush transfers his seat turkey does not want a war near its borders and it is balancing this great risk with a smaller one
4043253 if successful turkish foreign policy will gain credit if not u s and the european union will think that diplomacy is no good in this case
4043254 we tell the iranians you need nuclear energy we need it more than you do but the nuclear program should be transparent and it is up to you to demonstrate that it is peaceful
4043255 hoping that any word that does not come from iranian leader ayatollah khamenei will solve the nuclear crisis is na ve iranians know that the west can not act against them as seen in the georgian crisis with russia
4043256 iran is a regional power that wants recognition you can not ignore iran
4043257 iranian diplomats tell that the visit is a different one in that its topics will be comprehensive extending from economic relations to regional matters
4043258 israel is disappointed that turkey has invited for an official visit a leader who denies publicly the holocaust thus granting him legitimacy this is an unfortunate visit it is a bad idea to invite and host him at a time when iran is not giving any signs of cooperating with the international community
4043259 our major concern is that the international community remains united in its message to iran that it must give up its nuclear ambition we understand turkey is a neighbor with iran and we hope that it gives the right messages to iran

4043385 by the supremacy of whiteness blackness had to by necessity be its foil be its opposite
4043386 blackface is still blackface and i think its important that we have to stop allowing ourselves to be perceived as clowns to the rest of the world
4043387 a white guy playing this black role to challenge himself the most in a way thats wrong headed and going too far to me that was the funnier idea

4043390 the municipality cant use the current emblem neither as a city logo nor in municipal flags
4043391 the court decision should be taken in whole it is illegal and impossible to implement some part of it and ignore the other part the municipality has no right to interpret or change the original court decision
4043392 the municipal flag is an official element which promotes the municipality so the municipality cant use the logo in their flags just as they cant use it in their official headed papers
4043393 it is legal for the municipality to apply to the council of state but it wouldnt change anything for the municipality to apply to the echr as it isnt a place for appeal

4043397 i cannot say whether we will attend the auction or not right now
4043398 we will discuss the issue in our board meeting if we attend the auction the amount we have paid should be subtracted from the sale price of the land
4043399 dat holding has the operating and usage rights for the atak y land until 2038
4043400 if the land in question is sold the company that wins the tender will become our new host institution the result would not change our investment plans
4043401 we foresee 1 billion of investment according to the basis of this master plan
4043402 we have been renovating the old crowne plaza hotel as the first stage of this plan the renovation of the hotel will amount to 60 million and the hotel will begin to serve under the name of sheraton hotel in 2009 after the completion of the renovation
4043403 we will pay this amount to the company that will purchase the land if it is sold
4043404 tok could have given the land to our company in the first auction but it did not
4043405 mahmud darwish has a place in the hearts of all palestinians and arabs
4043406 recent escalation in military engagement between russia and georgia poses a threat to certain key oil and gas pipelines which transit georgia
4043407 there have been no deliberate attempts to damage that pipeline
4043408 we think it any attack would be counter active even though it can happen in a conflict
4043409 demonstrate that it is a volatile region it is a crucial region for getting caspian oil to consumer markets
4043410 with negligible domestic oil production unlike some of its caspian neighbors georgias significance to global oil and gas markets is as a transit corridor
4043411 threat of an attack on the btc baku tblisi ceyhan pipeline poses the bigger risk to oil markets it is clear that more generally georgia is a key energy transit hub in the caucasus region and a country of significant strategic importance to energy markets
4043412 the outage on the btc pipeline and recent hostilities in the caucasus highlight the potentially precarious nature of pipeline energy supplies in the region
4043413 with the btc currently closed disruption to georgian energy infrastructure further limits the possibility of getting caspian oil and gas to markets
4043414 renewed flows through georgia expected from september could be further delayed if the line is damaged during the russia georgia conflict
4043415 along the same corridor runs the south caucasus gas pipeline a branch of this pipeline continues through to the russian port of tuapse transiting the region of abkhazia another georgian area affected by separatist action where russian troops are reportedly also being mobilized
4043416 total product exports leaving georgian ports typically average 50 000 70 000 barrels per day
4043417 latest reports suggest that oil exports from poti have ceased while only partial operations are currently possible from supsa and batumi
4043418 stimulating the small and medium size enterprises or smes to merge
4043419 we shall carry on a new program and a new vision in economy
4043420 bringing the interest currency capital triangle under control is impossible
4043421 our most important suggestion is the need for a new economic program even though all of our suggestions are so called vain the proposal of a new program has crucial importance turkey is unable to move with the current program
4043422 we have been publishing reports and research on turkeys economy for 25 years
4043423 sometimes government officials ask us to send our reports to them but mostly we send them the reports straight away
4043424 the need for a new economic program is clearly realized through the data in the reports
4043425 weve been trying to do our best diagnosing the problems and providing resolutions for many years
4043426 north and south ossetia is the same country they are not separate
4043427 we have no problem with the georgian people but we condemn georgian president mikheil saakashvili
4043428 murderer saakachvili he is armed and incited by the west unfortunately the interests of america and russia conflict in the caucasus lands
4043429 we mourn for the 2 500 ossetians murdered in two days and we also mourn the innocent georgian people the people are friends but the powers kill them
4043430 we are ready to help our people living there and if a war erupts we will go there
4043431 i live in turkey and often go to abkhazia but my motherland my roots are in abkhazia
4043432 the press paid far more attention to russias attack against georgia than the deaths in south ossetia caused by the first georgian attacks
4043433 those weapons are bought and sent with our taxes and they are used against our brothers and sisters
4043434 service procurement from a single company without a public tender damages public interest because the sector is open to competition and alternative enterprises it is not in accord with law
4043435 telephone service procurement over unilateral contract determined by a single company causes serious financial losses for the state when tender regulations were implemented savings worth ytl 10 billion were accomplished in 2007 it is clear that the saving is the result of a tender system which is open to competition
4043436 turkish telecom is a private company and our rival now it ensures the service alone this is not legal unless local calling is liberalized the sector cannot grow because 40 percent of all telephone calls are local
4043437 even though rate basis is not certain i believe that competition supplies at least a 20 percent rate decrease
4043438 we attach importance to cooperation with other european capitals of culture
4043439 streetwaves is a nice opportunity for young people from around europe to share their own culture with each other through music we will support young turkish people to join international events like this and open to the world we believe that istanbul will be home to many international events like the streetwaves festival and in the end will turn the city into a meeting point for culture and art with the help of the youth
4043440 we invite people to those events by saying come with your pillow and blanket it will be possible to see the istanbul symphony orchestra in bayrampa a lhan er ahin in b y kada and selim sesler and kolektifistanbul in zeytinburnu
4043441 the success of the istanbul european capital of culture 2010 project depends on the interest of the city residents in the project thats why we call for them to support it
4043442 we believe that this will save substantial sums of money that we now spend on police details
4043443 we feel it is a reneg on the governors promise
4043444 he came into office pledging to put 1 000 police on the street this is going to take 1 000 police off the street we think that public safety will suffer in the long run
4043445 we treat each and every detainee in our custody with the same high level of quality professional care possible
4043446 after almost two weeks of suffering with unbearable back pain and unable to get any sleep he was so weak and looked horrible
4043447 he said i told the nursing department im in pain but they dont believe me
4043448 because he could no longer withstand the suffering inside the facility
4043449 they are not going to send you back to the facility again brother you are free now
4043450 how long can the regime control what people are allowed to know without the people caring enough to object on current evidence for quite a while
4043451 the allegations on violation of competition rules in pricing fuel products are being investigated
4043452 albeit the high tax rate is a prominent factor in high fuel prices still the tax free prices are over the european union standards
4043453 italy which is a reference for all the mediterranean countries is taken as an example in specifying the fuel prices the only thing that increases the fuel prices in turkey is tax rates
4043454 according to initial estimates the bomb was made up of 20 kilograms 44 pounds of explosives
4043455 the army and security forces will not be terrorized by attacks and crimes that target it and civil society and the history of the army attests to that
4043456 now the army and the people are being targeted when it used to be the politicians who were the targets
4043457 newspapers in pakistan im afraid dream up things then start writing about them theres no such thing
4043458 people have given us their vote of trust we dont have trust in you musharraf so its logical and legal that you should leave
4043459 passengers leaving today will hardly notice that there has been a strike
4043460 our international operations brought 5 percent volume growth in particular turkey china india eastern europe and the middle east were influential in the growth
4043461 it was a demonstration of russias new strength for all those who believed that russia could be ignored
4043462 russia has certainly gotten up off its knees and sat in a tank
4043463 otherwise it would have shown that moscow is completely impotent
4043464 what gave washington legitimacy nothing more than strength and now it is russia who has become strong
4043465 popular opinion is not paying attention to sophisticated arguments about the alliance and international contributions
4043466 economic and social issues are at the top top top
4043467 the agenda is being driven by economic issues at the moment and will continue to be regardless of who is prime minister
4043468 a waning of nationalism means that its easier to construct cross border economic ties
4043469 nationalism doesnt sell very well in japan at the moment
4043470 fukuda has learned this and hopefully the ldp has learned this too
4043471 the governments in all these countries broadly would like these issues to go away but they are always vulnerable to being stirred up especially when elected politicians want to distract people
4043472 i want them politicians to deal with issues close to our lives such as taxes and the way bureaucrats run everything in this country
4043473 aso like abe has splendid right wing credentials so in that sense even if he doesnt go to yasukuni nationalists will support him
4043474 the demand for indian skilled labour is the highest in the us followed by the gulf in recent years there has been a growing demand for engineers in the oil and gas sector and aviation
4043475 while its true that we need to do more to keep our most talented workers at home we must also consider how we can strengthen our collective employer brand to attract talented workers from overseas
4043476 one which has manufactured and exploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device prior to january 1 1967

4043479 this is not about south osettia it is about making a statement to the west and georgia will be left on its own to face the russians
4043480 saakashvili fell into the trap of russia this is what russia wanted to happen it was all planned
4043481 heydar aliyev would have prevented georgia from entering south ossettia he could control georgia too from baku
4043482 russia is a power of the region that you have to work with you cannot get results if you do not take their interests into consideration
4043483 it has been a place for men since we first opened our eyes
4043484 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
4043485 russian occupying forces are continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
4043486 russian tanks are on the move russian troops are behaving extremely aggressively they are in the process of completing ethnic cleansing of my population
4043487 id like to calm everybody down the russian military is not advancing towards the capital
4043488 with the goal of demilitarizing the zone adjacent to the conflict and likewise with the goal of guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population russian peacekeepers are removing these vehicles and munitions
4043489 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
4043490 the aggressive russian force beyond south ossetian borders has been something that really shocked many people
4043491 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
4043492 it immediately became clear that in fact the confrontation was hardly finished
4043493 it is too early to reach unequivocal conclusions about whether the agreement reached by medvedev and sarkozy will really put an end to military actions in south ossetia
4043494 saakashvili is characterized by his unpredictability and a lack of willingness to respect agreements
4043495 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
4043496 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
4043497 political discussion and open public debate on how to solve the problem by peaceful means
4043498 foolish to engage in a confrontation in the tskhinvali region i e south ossetia because it is bound to affect civilians immediately
4043499 a place that is valuable to me for both business and personal reasons
4043500 in countries like india where you have so much talent and potential for future breakthroughs economic growth will be driven by jobs and revenue from companies that are building businesses around commercial software microsofts role is to make sure that our partners have the best tools and knowledge to make this happen
4043501 we really worked and we were well prepared but unfortunately we made two mistakes and you cannot win gold with two mistakes
4043502 im really excited this is the strongest team weve ever had and weve won the most important medal on home soil
4043503 the gold medal could attract more children to gymnastics in china and we will be even stronger in the future
4043504 it was a life or death game for us that was entertaining but id have preferred the win
4043505 i have mixed emotions but am proud of this group
4043506 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
4043507 from now on its just a downward slope the end is close i love it
4043508 the main factor in skin aging almost at 80 percent is the sunlight sunning does not only age the skin but also increases the risk of skin cancer
4043509 especially those with white skin colored eyes and blonde and red hair are at high risk of skin cancer
4043510 you must wear a hat or at least a cap and dark colored glasses
4043511 it is preferable to stay in shaded areas but of course these precautions are not enough you must use sun care products
4043512 with the regular use of sun care products from childhood skin cancer risk decreases by almost 70 percent

4043517 the diving adventure of ka began in the mid 1980s
4043518 i have discovered and named approximately 50 diving sites around ka
4043519 the peak of my happiness was the time when i discovered the plane wreck from world war ii only a few miles away from ka
4043520 but while discovering new sites we must not neglect the protection of the old ones
4043521 it is forbidden to fish but selling fish is allowed
4043522 for example grouper are under protection but i want to ask restaurant owners how can you serve orfoz in your restaurants while it is forbidden to fish all around the year
4043523 we try to fill in the gap in the implementation
4043524 we have warned all the restaurants not to sell the baby grouper or the ones killed by spear otherwise we would put their names in our black list as non recommendable places we always check it
4043525 ban everything in everywhere if you want you cannot stop those fishing with dynamites banning is not a way of protection
4043526 the purpose should be managing all resources in accordance with sustainable tourism concept
4043527 all the parties here hoteliers tourists fishermen fish plants should all survive without ignoring or destroying one other
4043528 of course the underwater is more colorful like an aquarium in indonesia but here the landscape of the sea bottom is very interesting caves canyons historical remains flora
4043529 we dont like the places of mass tourism the place we visit should be familiar to us and friendly therefore we are very happy here
4043530 i read the script and the very human story at the very core of this film spoke to me very clearly
4043531 hopefully we can get this movie to be made at the end of this year

4043543 y sobre todo tampoco dejar la ventana abierta mucha gente lo hace para ventilar el coche mientras est n ausentes y no hacen m s que facilitarles la labor a los delincuentes
4043544 por creer que al estar cerca del mismo no vamos a ser objeto de ning n robo
4043545 suelen actuar all porque les queda de camino van roban un coche y luego suben a penamoa a vender lo que han robado a cambio de droga

4043566 if the future leaders are listening tell them come forward tell them of a new beginning
4043567 the importance of the award is that it sets a safety net below which conditions cant go
4043568 there is a paucity of information coming from the premier
4043569 the premier says mr johnston was interviewed by police last night and the investigation involves a possible disclosure of official secrets
4043570 whats occurred has shown that police are able to investigate this matter and we need to give investigators room to investigate this issue

4043577 we chose to exhibit for the first time at the green tech expo in los angeles because we are based here and because our region including the border states and mexico will play a central role in the alternative energy future of the world
4043578 we are dedicated to delivering our breakthrough technology to help propel the algae to oil revolution
4043579 the need for clean sustainable energy sources is a defining issue for this new century
4043580 the work that originoil is doing exemplifies the kind of innovation that is needed to meet this challenge
4043581 driven principally by legislation and water stress the global mbr market will display double digit growth
4043582 legislation is the primary driving force in northern europe and parts of the united states and canada while in other parts of the world notably iberia china india australia and the middle east water stress is the dominant issue
4043583 certain asian and latin american markets are highly protected and not conducive to the entry of large multinational companies
4043584 there is generally a profusion of local vendors that rather than meeting high and rigid international quality standards offer low cost solutions tailored to the local scenario and requirements
4043585 thanks to the new young chefs paris is reclaiming its title as food capital of the world
4043586 this incident once again showed that we live in a country where mass media are not free
4043587 i have no doubts that it was done by some government circles
4043588 unfortunately this was not the first or the last such incident
4043589 everyone must understand that gone are the days when issues could be solved by force
4043590 if they think they can intimidate us they are badly wrong
4043591 realistisch gesehen gibt es mit einer solchen strecke immer kleine probleme das w re aber bei einer permanenten anlage ganz genauso

4043594 ich freue mich auf die gelegenheit einen m glichen sechsten sieg zu holen
4043595 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry
4043596 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies
4043597 i dont think we do i think we want to have a broader marketplace than that
4043598 all of the existing search engines are proprietary black boxes
4043599 you have no idea how things are ranked and whats going on
4043600 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
4043601 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
4043602 during the past year many of the top social networking sites have demonstrated rapid growth in their global user bases
4043603 facebooks recent ascension to become the top global social networking site has been spurred by its substantial growth across worldwide regions
4043604 if every single thing went extremely well id say that there is a chance he could play in a regular season game

4043609 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereign has encroached on georgias sovereignty and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible
4043610 clearly over the course of the last 24 hours this crisis has escalated
4043611 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
4043612 i did say that the olympic games coming to china will help china open up further and reform better
4043613 i think china has been stepping forward and if you ask the ordinary chinese on the streets they will give you the same answer
4043614 everybody is happy people are optimistic about their own future that is a fact
4043615 that does not mean we are not fulfilling our promise
4043616 people will see better for themselves what china is like
4043617 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4043618 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4043619 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4043620 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4043621 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4043622 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4043623 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4043624 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4043625 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4043626 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4043627 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4043628 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4043629 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4043630 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4043645 sometimes a glance a few casual words fragments of a melody floating through the quiet air of a summer evening a book that accidentally comes into hands a poem or memory laden fragrance may bring about the impulse which changes and determines our whole life
4043646 the key debate for those who teach a level students and undergraduates is whether the pressure on teachers and lecturers to spoon feed a level students through exams means students fail to develop the desire to continue learning and the skills to learn independently
4043647 we urge the government to completely rethink the current targets regime as well as the curriculum and the current post 16 exams to make schooling more relevant so students leave school with the skills they need and a hunger to learn

4043692 this oversight was exactly that an oversight and there was nothing devious or underhand in our decision in fact we were duty bound to correct the error and reaffirm our commitment to car magazine
4043693 publishing the official souvenir programme for the johannesburg international motor show is a great honour for car and we were delighted when naamsa kagiso decided to partner with south africas leading motoring magazine as far back as march this year the programme will not only contain all the relevant motor show information but also a mix of interesting motoring content making this official programme a keepsake after the show for all motoring enthusiasts

4043695 if i was in charge of this country it would all be very different
4043696 the problems in this area are vast and really entrenched too often people try to help by doing little bits everywhere or theyll be around for a while and then their project will end we have partners in other boroughs but were focused on tower hamlets and were here long term
4043697 its not always about the subject its about the process of learning about how to train your brain
4043698 some people will only get a level 1 qualification because that is all they can manage but weve worked on their soft skills on getting them here on time on them being polite theres more to it
4043699 so they see all the jobs in that business they might come out wanting to be a lawyer or an it guy or a security guard if thats where theyre at in their life

4043719 frankly i found their response to be dodgy and unsatisfying
4043720 unless changes are made physicians could be forced to refer patients for abortions even if it violates their conscience

4043888 the star wars films have always been stellar examples of visionary visual effects seeing these effects paired with computer animation and the behind the scenes knowledge from dave filoni will be an incredible experience for fans and film professionals alike

4043891 i started with the soundtrack by mixing and re pitching various abstract sounds that i recorded
4043892 the idea being to create music from noises then i procedurally animated numerous abstract 3d objects to the track these animations are then used as source imagery to my 3d noise shaders which have parameters that animate to the soundtrack as well the camera travels through the resulting animated evolving volume i went back and forth between the sound and visuals as i would stumble upon cool moments in each and wanted to tie them together so that every sound event had a visual event and vice versa
4043893 one of the really interesting sets of papers are on what i characterize as gradient based illustration techniques
4043894 they offer very powerful techniques for image creation and editing the applications are as compelling as painting i expect these ideas to move from academia to the artist within a couple years
4043895 who would have guessed that face manipulation would be a trend this year

4043901 a fairly large group of us were having lunch during the jury meeting for the content of siggraph 08 and one person lamented that at the conference we go absorb information sit passively and listen and then leave were not creating anything we in this case refers to the research community so we talked about it
4043902 its totally freeform but i imagine people will exchange information at the meeting arrange to meet and in the meantime think about the problem
4043903 well give them problems that are grand in nature not something you could solve by writing a paper
4043904 this is a process that starts four years in advance and requires macro and micro management skills
4043905 also the roles that the chair has to fill are mind bogglingly vast
4043906 she has to be a visionary a strategist and a hands on implementer as well as a leader a manager a mentor and a friend all while holding down a day job thankfully the amazing conference team of volunteers and contractors makes meeting that impossibly tall order a possibility
4043907 we have an excellent collection of robotics demos and of course takeo kanade is a featured speaker presenting

4043912 one of the exciting projects that they asked me to join within my first months was an academy of technology study on the future of research we interviewed researchers and lab directors both internal and external to ibm in industry and academia we asked them what they saw on the horizon for the next 10 years not just in terms of research topics but also in terms of the way people will be working in research environments our findings were very rich and we aim to publish our final report at the end of this year
4043913 we wanted to keep whats worked in the past but also push ourselves by making a more a festival environment for cg
4043914 it was really kinda supposed to be a quick peek
4043915 but as is the nature of a rabbitholes display once you turn the lights on well i warned him this place was going to go crazy
4043916 many of these cutting edge technologies exemplify how our past informs our future and how it affects the upcoming opportunities and challenges of computer graphics and interactive techniques

4044021 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4044022 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4044023 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4044024 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4044073 lord if my brother sins against me how often must i forgive him as many as seven times
4044074 i say to you not seven times but seventy seven times that is why the kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants when he began the accounting a debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount since he had no way of paying it back his master ordered him to be sold along with his wife his children and all his property in payment of the debt at that the servant fell down did him homage and said be patient with me and i will pay you back in full moved with compassion the master of that servant let him go and forgave him the loan when that servant had left he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a much smaller amount he seized him and started to choke him demanding pay back what you owe falling to his knees his fellow servant begged him be patient with me and i will pay you back but he refused instead he had him put in prison until he paid back the debt now when his fellow servants saw what had happened they were deeply disturbed and went to their master and reported the whole affair his master summoned him and said to him you wicked servant i forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to should you not have had pity on your fellow servant as i had pity on you then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers until he should pay back the whole debt so will my heavenly father do to you unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart

4044077 whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whoever wishes to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it what profit would there be for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life or what can one give in exchange for his life for the son of man will come with his angels in his fathers glory and then he will repay everyone according to his conduct amen i say to you there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
4044078 amen i say to you unless you turn and become like children you will not enter the kingdom of heaven
4044079 it is not the will of your heavenly father that one of these little ones be lost

4044083 you are the messiah the son of the living god
4044084 blessed are you simon son of jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my heavenly father and so i say to you you are peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it i will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
4044085 god forbid lord no such thing shall ever happen to you
4044086 get behind me satan you are an obstacle to me you are thinking not as god does but as human beings do
4044087 whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
4044088 the son of man is to be handed over to men and they will kill him and he will be raised on the third day
4044089 what is your opinion simon from whom do the kings of the earth take tolls or census tax from their subjects or from foreigners
4044090 then the subjects are exempt but that we may not offend them go to the sea drop in a hook and take the first fish that comes up open its mouth and you will find a coin worth twice the temple tax give that to them for me and for you
4044091 if two of you agree on earth about anything for which they are to pray it shall be granted to them by my heavenly father for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them

4044143 the lisbon treaty referendum was brian cowens declared first priority his failure to lead a strong coherent and effective yes campaign led to a result which has left reform of the european union in crisis and created the potential for ireland to be isolated from the heart of european decision making

4044164 students in northern ireland are to be congratulated for their exceptional performance this year and credit must be given to the teachers and parents who have supported them

4044166 the most important thing is not to turn the situation into a catastrophe your son or daughter will need emotional comfort and support but also practical help and advice you will need to sit down with them and look at the situation before deciding on the next steps
4044167 waiting for exam results can be an anxious time there are high expectations to succeed and achieve from friends and family
4044168 inevitably the focus of family life is on the countdown to results day teenagers can have different reactions to situations like this laid back and unfazed or extremely worried it can be hard for parents to strike the right balance being supportive but in the way the young person needs the best approach is just to try and get through it

4044173 often contacting their friends can be comforting especially when they find many others have similar grades
4044174 when there is a supportive and positive atmosphere children are more likely to cope better
4044175 sometimes in the hype surrounding exam results and the opportunities open to those with good grades young peoples own ambitions and wishes can get sidelined or forgotten about
4044176 as parents we need to be careful not to assume that children with ability and academic achievements will necessarily want to pursue university careers it is great if they have that choice but we need to listen to and respect our childrens aspirations
4044177 lets avoid trying to live our dreams through our children or hoping that they will take up the chances we never had young people who choose their own career paths are more likely to succeed than those who dont at this time of the year we need to pay attention to what our children want even if their ideas dont run in parallel with our own

4044181 this is us four guys it is a new gb boat and it is different opposition it is a different olympics and we should not let the history like that bother us
4044182 someone has to start a new era and hopefully it will be us
4044183 everyone will be having the race of their lives and that makes it very very close all six boats that do line up will think they can win
4044184 the french provided a good challenge for us today because in the final there will be a lot more crews alongside us for a lot longer

4044197 exotic locations gave great scope to authors to be a bit racier it is usually an english person going into the tropics to experience this different culture

4044200 with horizons being broadened and more international travel the romances set in rose covered cottages did not have the same cache as greece ibiza and south africa
4044201 the alpha male has to be larger than life an incredibly heroic figure he was usually fabulously wealthy with a mystery about him
4044202 as the world has become more globalised our settings have had to become more exotic more luxurious and exciting where our heroes were once millionaires now they have to be billionaires

4044210 the matter is further complicated if pepper gas was used as the irritant since this is a plant toxin
4044211 that argument rests on the assumption that there are no other toxic effects of these chemicals and that one can control the dose so that one never crosses into the dose range for toxic effects
4044212 it also is based a concept of toxicity that is centuries out of date malodorants do have a physiological effect and toxicity is not limited to lethality
4044213 we are reaping the whirlwind today because of government secrecy in the past
4044214 it has allowed critics to make unsupportable claims about agents such as bz without rejoinder from the government research community

4044247 when we first saw stumpy in hervey bay in 2001 we thought for sure he wouldnt survive without his tail
4044248 its a 20 000 kilometre return journey when they migrate and that is an amazing feat for a whale without a tail
4044249 a mixture of a weaker us dollar and stronger commodity prices helped buoy the aussie dollar
4044250 domestic developments played second fiddle to the aussie dollars price action
4044251 weve had very volatile moves so im sure that theres a fair amount of investor caution out there
4044252 that will set the tone for the next 24 hours
4044253 certainly if euro zone gdp surprises on the downside and there is any sign of cpi inflation peaking then that would give the us dollar fresh impetus and that would see the aussie dollar back down towards yesterdays lows

4044261 with regard to the new 1 333mhz fsb dual core processors it s fair to say that intel has not only maintained its current dominance in the cpu market but also extended its performance lead in the mainstream that by and large is thanks to the quite ridiculous price cuts that come into effect on july 22nd they re ridiculous because they re so massive but then amd s various price avalanches have been at least equal to intel s
4044262 the farmer said okay if you take this kid up for a ride so he took me up and the first thing i noticed was how cool it was here i was far above the earth and it was cool well it didnt take me long to decide that flying was for me

4044269 she left all who knew her with memories of gentle caring ways and her many acts of kindness showered on family friends and the children of alaska
4044270 bonny looked for the good in people and was interested in helping them from the time she was a little girl
4044271 bonny was one of alaskas greatest advocates for mountain running
4044272 we will miss her commitment to the healthy futures project that made such a significant difference in the lives of our students
4044273 bonny was the rare person able to move mountains through kindness and grace
4044274 bonny changed the way anchorage thinks and plays in such a positive way
4044275 she was filled with grace an angel i used to tease her by asking where she hid her wings
4044276 this is such a terrible situation to happen to people no one foresees that their dog will do something like that
4044277 its already attacked somebody so theres no reason to keep it alive

4044282 this investigation has been going on for 14 years and ive had the case for less than a year
4044283 however mr dion has a constitutional right to a competent attorney a fair trial as well as his due process rights
4044284 its just so wrong that victims dont have a right the victims family just gets dragged through all this
4044285 it was an isolated incident but one we took full responsibility for
4044286 they contacted us admitted to the mistake they made and basically said it wont happen again
4044287 if i go off the trail and break a dwarf birch im facing a 1 000 fine
4044288 if we trespass were facing fines theyll send a botanist out there to look at the ground theyll spend thousands of dollars to prosecute us
4044289 for me its like wait a second sorry dont quite get it
4044290 i think whatever penalties would apply to us should apply to them
4044291 weve already made a formal apology to ahtna weve taken disciplinary action against the employees involved in the case we have the full intention of restoring to the extent humanly possible the damage that occurred in that area
4044292 back in the 1980s we had to draw all these lines and get affidavits from elders to show weve been hunting in those areas since the 30s and 40s with motorized vehicles whether it was a bulldozer or a weasel
4044293 we proved all that to them to the point where they agreed those are traditional hunting areas
4044294 from there its just been a slow whittling away process

4044298 das war ein wichtiger sieg aber es w re ein fehler wenn wir das r ckspiel untersch tzen
4044299 man darf nicht vergessen dass artmedia vor ein paar jahren ein ganz hartes duell mit celtic gewonnen hat trotzdem sind wir nat rlich sehr zufrieden mit diesem deutlichen sieg juve war zwei jahre nicht im europapokal vertreten deshalb wollte sich die mannschaft unbedingt eindrucksvoll zur ckmelden wir haben sehr gut gespielt und eine leistung gezeigt die unsere fans von uns erwartet hatten
4044300 wir sind sehr zufrieden sowohl mit dem ergebnis als auch mit unserer leistung
4044301 trotz der fehlenden spielpraxis hat die ganze mannschaft eine tolle leistung gezeigt gegen ende hat nat rlich unsere kraft nachgelassen wenn wir so weitermachen sollten wir auch ausw rts gewinnen

4044303 i went down to let the cat out and noticed the garage doors had been opened i thought what the hell is going on and saw that my bike had gone
4044304 they had to come over the six foot garden gates break the padlock on the steel garage door and move lindsays bike out of the way to take my bike
4044305 there must have been about two or three of them because they would have to lift my bike and move a steel roof support joist out of the way as well
4044306 she was my little baby it was my one pride and joy and the only other thing i loved apart from lindsay ive just not been myself i just feel depressed and emotionally quite strained
4044307 in some dodgy breakers yard in hundreds of pieces ready to be sold off
4044308 my worst fear is that i will never see it again i really feel sorry for the bike because somebody will never be able to ride it or sell it in its state i cant explain how upset it makes me feel
4044309 hanging is too good for the scum who do this sort of thing
4044310 this used to be a bustling little area but people are now frightened
4044311 a customer got mugged in the phonebox outside after coming in for her paper a few months back and ive noticed it in my year on year sales which have definitely fallen
4044312 there are people who get their methadone from the chemist who come out looking spaced out its ludicrous so i think the police station is a good idea to improve the area
4044313 i know all of the people who come to the store for methadone and we dont have any trouble at all i cant speak for what goes on outside the shop but we have no problems but i do think having the police office in the centre of the town is a good idea
4044314 we dont get hassle in the cafe but there are people who hang around a lot across the road and i can see how older people could be intimidated
4044315 its good that there will be a proper police presence in the centre of the town so residents will feel a bit safer
4044316 we identified the need some time ago to provide a visible police facility in rosyth to help meet the policing needs of the area a former shop property has been secured on queensferry road and planning permission has been granted to change its use
4044317 we are now examining the arrangements to ensure the call point can bring maximum benefit to the community bearing in mind that the aircraft carrier work at babcock rosyth will result in increased activity in the area
4044318 the council said they had no knowledge of it but i told my son we would go up anyway
4044319 when we got there there was somebody handing out fliers saying it was a skate demo and my son got quite excited
4044320 i didnt pay much attention at first my son was listening to them talk about scootering and skateboarding and how cool it was
4044321 but then they got the amplifiers out got everybody together and sat them down and told them god did not like the world any more the world was going to die and only those who loved jesus would be saved
4044322 at this point we left and i went straight home and phoned the police council and the press
4044323 they should be not wandering around playgrounds corralling children and telling them that the end of the world is coming
4044324 i dont care what they believe but how dare they do this to my children in a public place without the knowledge of the parents or the local authorities
4044325 im flabbergasted and gobsmacked that theres a group of people who appear to have no problem wandering about childrens parks talking about adult themes
4044326 if you want to put forward your views to people then find a situation where people have volunteered their participation
4044327 my son was made to feel fearful and im not letting him go to the park on his own for a very long time
4044328 we did exactly what we said on the ad a professional skater came to do a demonstration and gave away hundreds of pounds worth of skating paraphernalia
4044329 we gave it all away before even a word was said we didnt make anyone sit through it to get the stuff the skater is doing a tour all over scotland and nobody has said a word
4044330 people could walk away at any time there wasnt anything holding them back
4044331 there were other adults there with kids and they never said anything there was not one other adult there who raised any kind of concern
4044332 we have the right by law to say what we believe its as simple as that there are people who dont like what were doing but were fine with that
4044333 the skate park is a public place and as long as no one is committing a criminal offence they have the same right to be there as anyone else
4044334 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4044335 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
4044336 the support group contacted me about four years ago about becoming a member when my kidney trouble started
4044337 im not sure how much well get but im hoping to raise as much as i can they do a lot of good work arranging christmas parties day trips and i want to give something back
4044338 its also a challenge for myself i havent been in the water swimming for six years and wanted to get back in and my family and friends suggested this
4044339 i thought if i was going to do a challenge i didnt want it to be a doddle if people are giving me money for it
4044340 the first time i went in i managed only six lengths and was totally shattered
4044341 but ive got stronger and stronger and i think i will manage my half mile
4044342 i just thought it would be a case of swimming without moving my legs but its not been that easy you need legs for balance and they help with your buoyancy
4044343 i find the breaststroke and the back crawl easier when i do the front crawl i tend to rock and roll without legs
4044344 i did think id probably never walk again but im walking now using a crutch but i suppose its something that had to be done or it would have killed me it was that or end up not being here
4044345 i cant go on holidays any more because youre stuck with the dialysis i do miss that but ive come to terms with it
4044346 hopefully one day ill get a transplant ive been on the waiting list about a year
4044347 but i was upset about having to give up my job teaching children and adults i really enjoyed that and if i could go back to teaching and swimming i would
4044348 i never would have imagined that we would have been able to accomplish what weve accomplished in such a short amount of time

4044371 we believe that utilisation of a software based access management solution can be used to properly secure all physical and virtual machines without having to reconfigure the physical network for security
4044372 designed to secure both physical and virtual environments through a single management window such a solution helps security administrators rapidly implement policies software based access management is helping organisations protect their critical business assets and enabling them to focus key staff on strategic projects
4044373 if you layer thousands of security rules and access control lists over hundreds of internal firewalls and vlans it s easy to imagine the maintenance challenges organisations face
4044374 and if you add the fact that firewalls and vlans are static in nature and one of the premises of server virtualisation is migration the management challenges are compounded

4044380 kondisi ini harus menjadi perhatian yang serius dari berbagai pihak terutama pemerintah karena jika hutan habis populasi orangutan juga dikhawatirkan akan punah

4044387 fantasy football is such an enormous revenue generator the numbers are staggering and thats reflected on our site
4044388 considering the sheer number of armchair analysts and kitchen quarterbacks voicing their opinions and a lot of these people are really funny very entertaining it made sense to put them all in one place and have it coincide with the upcoming season
4044389 something like this is a really interactive program and to do this kind of program requires a fairly complex cooperative effort on the side of the sponsor and our side so we cant just roll them out
4044390 it has huge potential for other sponsors who want to work with us on these things it can be scaled really well
4044391 provides a new way for us to engage our core customer base and challenge them to become part of our online community
4044392 what it does is that it tells us that the legislation is good legislation and that we can use it to pull down fortification

4044405 the charge of insulting a sharia judge during a phone call is fabricated
4044406 all these charges against me have been compiled since 2001 because of a vigil we committee organized two months ago in which we demanded the resignation of the general prosecutor
4044407 i do not care if i go to prison because we already live in a big prison i will never stop nor go silent nor give up my position
4044408 in australias new south wales supreme court in december 2005 a visiting pakistani rapist testified that his victims had no right to say no because they were not wearing a headscarf
4044409 and earlier this year australians were outraged when lebanese sheik faiz mohammed gave a lecture in sydney where he informed his audience that rape victims had no one to blame but themselves women he said who wore skimpy clothing invited men to rape them
4044410 a few months earlier in copenhagen islamic mufti and scholar shahid mehdi created uproar when like his peer in australia he stated that women who did not wear a headscarf were asking to be raped
4044411 and with haunting synchronicity in 2004 the london telegraph reported that visiting egyptian scholar sheik yusaf al qaradawi claimed female rape victims should be punished if they were dressed immodestly when they were raped
4044412 in norway and sweden journalist fjordman warns of a rape epidemic
4044413 in sweden according to translator for jihad watch ali dashti gang rapes usually involving muslim immigrant males and native swedish girls have become commonplace
4044414 in indonesia in 1998 human rights groups documented the testimony of over 100 chinese women who were gang raped during the riots that preceded the fall of president suharto

4044417 in australia when journalist paul sheehan reported honestly on the sydney gang rapes he was called a racist and accused of stirring up anti muslim hatred
4044418 that is a disgraceful column that reflects poorly on us all at the herald
4044419 keysar trad vice president of the australian lebanese muslim association said the gang rapes were a heinous crime but complained it was rather unfair that the ethnicity of the rapists had been reported
4044420 journalist miranda devine reported during the same rape trials that all reference to ethnicity had been deleted from the victim impact statement because the prosecutors wanted to negotiate a plea bargain
4044421 so when judge megan latham declared there is no evidence before me of any racial element in the commission of these offences everyone believed her and the court the politicians and most of the press may as well have raped the girls again
4044422 according to the guardian during the recent french riots a saudi prince with shares in news corporation boasted to a conference in dubai that he had phoned rupert murdoch and complained about fox news describing the disturbances as muslim riots

4044426 one of them clearly he missed i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting the referees have to be in unison but there was a lot of doubt about a lot of the shots out there
4044427 im glad it wasnt for a gold medal because that is all that this olympics would have been remembered for unfortunately
4044428 first they called her name up then they did not even put her name up even though the chinese had finished it was totally unusual holding
4044429 i think we would be disappointed as a team if we didnt get close to what we did in manchester
4044430 things are going well we are the best we can be
4044431 success has come quickly in cycling since britain started pouring money into programs aimed at getting results at the 2012 london olympics but sutton said there was still much work to do in the next few years
4044432 if you stop looking for marginal gains in any area youre going to get caught

4044479 as a result of preliminary investigations we have suspended four students and those students will remain suspended until we have further details from the police
4044480 that anyone could come into the school after hours and take advantage of defenceless animals that have been lovingly cared for by our students is disappointing
4044481 there will be consequences for the students according to their level of involvement
4044482 the college has put procedures in place to manage the wellbeing of all students

4044494 we have been under siege for the last two years
4044495 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
4044496 if the cease fire is just a front for extremists in gaza to rearm and regroup of course we have the right to act
4044497 any arms buildup is a direct violation of the calm that was achieved
4044498 they control the gaza strip with quite an iron fist if you dont mind me saying and none of this activity with the other groups would be happening unless hamas was complicit and allowing it to happen
4044499 i dont think we are going to re ignite the cold war
4044500 president bushs decision to send aid to the people of georgia and americans stand united in support of the men and women who will carry out this humanitarian mission

4044510 i know that uncle sam needs me to fight for an ideal i know nothin about
4044511 i think a lot depends on what happens over the next few weeks
4044512 if we are able to have continued access in terms of humanitarian supplies to these people if there is safe space for the civilians in that area if both sides respect their responsibility to allow displaced people to move where they want to move they i think a crisis can be avoided
4044513 the ethnic majority sinhala nation is intent on occupying and enslaving the tamil homeland

4044526 saat pembahasan ruu pemilu kan demokrat dan pan yang minta dengan sistem suara terbanyak tapi kalah karena partai besar seperti golkar dan pdip ngotot dengan sistem nomor urut jadi kami tidak ikut ikutan atau latah karena sejak awal justru kami menginginkan sistem ini ya jangan ada pahlawan kesiangan sekarang ini dulu menolak suara terbanyak sekarang kok tiba tiba setuju

4044549 epic battles all new minion play mechanics a stunningly detailed new visuals and a fresh theme overlord iis really packing a punch
4044550 were really excited about shifting the world to a new era where a roman inspired empire rises as the arch enemy of the overlord which leads to an epic clash between the regimented forces of a sprawling state and the faster harder more manic minion horde its also great to see the series reaching new formats the creativity being packed into the design for overlord dark legend on wii and overlord minions on nintendo ds make great use of the platforms unique features and are perfect extensions to the overlord series
4044551 in the last eight years theres been a lot of really wonderful planning and building of work and repertoire so the company is now poised
4044552 its time for us to go out and once again start touring internationally and nationally after weve been sort of hibernating
4044553 there is a strong classical core to it but it is really sort of pushed along with a contemporary energy and a very powerful spirit
4044554 it is undoubtedly a joy to see that a work of yours has a life
4044555 ballet may be an art form that truly touches the heart but it also touches the wallet
4044556 id love to have had clint at this festival im a huge fan of his directorial work sadly one cant get everything one wants universal studios decided not to offer the film to us
4044557 id be really surprised if he didnt get a best actor nomination for this film
4044558 if we really want to compete with the rest of the world then we really need to take a look at ensuring our athletes and coaches have everything they need
4044559 what our current results are telling me is certainly we have a long way to go but im also seeing some positive signs as well
4044560 we realistically dont do well in the first half of the games
4044561 going back as far as montreal 1976 its the fourth or fifth day and as late as the seventh before we get our first medal
4044562 thats why we keep pushing for more investment in sports and why torontos 2015 pan american bid is so important
4044563 i dont believe that a full time high performance athlete in canada has the ability to get enough funding to support themselves on a year round training cycle without having to look elsewhere whether its a part time job or sponsorship of some sort
4044564 theres no question when the proposals went forward we knew full well that adjustments a year to 18 months prior to the games would not have a huge impact
4044565 unfortunately thats the cost of doing business in a high performance sport these days
4044566 all we do is train that means as an athlete if we want to compete on the world stage we cant be working
4044567 e vero e quello che sta facendo in questo momento
4044568 ci sono tuttora molti contatti con delle societ italiane anzi le dir mi chiamano quasi ogni giorno
4044569 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4044570 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4044571 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4044572 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4044573 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4044574 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4044575 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4044576 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4044577 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4044578 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4044579 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4044580 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4044581 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4044590 electronic tagging devices can be appropriate as a condition of parole or probation
4044591 the cindy bischof law goes far beyond this placing long term electronic tags on men who have never been found guilty of any crime
4044592 without the benefit of a trial yet the foundation of our entire criminal justice system is based on a defendant being presumed innocent until proven guilty
4044593 are increasingly being used in family law cases to help one side jockey for an advantage in child custody
4044594 such orders are generally done ex parte without the accuseds knowledge and with no opportunity afforded for him to defend himself
4044595 a man can accidentally be in the same park or mall as his ex wife girlfriend and the electronic monitoring device could lead to his arrest even if he never actually saw her some men have even been tricked into violating the orders by former spouses the device will make this easier a woman could call her estranged husband tell him she needs him to come to her house because of a crisis with their children and then have an electronic record of his violation
4044596 perhaps such a drastic measure would be warranted if the men forced to wear the devices had meaningful and fair trials and were found to be guilty of violent or dangerous crimes however the bischof law empowers judges with the ability to mandate the gps tracking device on anyone who is accused of violating an order of protection
4044597 unfortunately the rush to protect the abused is so incredibly aggressive that the rights of the accused have been violated
4044598 i dont see any safeguard in this law this law basically presumes in these situations men are guilty
4044599 thanks to new legislation they may also be fitted with an electronic gps tracking bracelet

4044668 could this actually be a major philosophical point of view saying it seems to stop your wishing it could be some other way your frustration about whats happening or your total dismay about something appearing to be not quite right it is what it is
4044669 ill give up fighting it and judging it it is what it is
4044670 let it be there will be an answer let it be
4044671 wow i never did think of it that way but maybe ill start
4044672 and im going to make sure whoevers made the decision whoevers behind it is going to be accountable one way or the other
4044673 there is a very serious concern that this horse could have a relapse of this disease
4044674 this disease has already seen two people hospitalised and in a very serious condition
4044675 i think most people in the industry understand while its very sad protecting the industry does involve these sorts of very difficult decisions
4044676 these people were innocently doing something with the horse and became critically ill as a result of it
4044677 so from that point of view i have to support the unfortunate course of action that has to be taken
4044678 its very important that that part of the world keeps playing cricket
4044679 obviously those countries are struggling but if it doesnt happen i hope they do whatever they need to rectify the situation
4044680 i really cant say until i hear from aca and cricket australia
4044681 once again im going to have to look at that report and see what it says i cant commit either way at the moment
4044682 if we do go itll be on the basis of that all has been taken care of and that unease factor will hopefully be removed
4044683 theres obviously something going on although im only hearing it second hand
4044684 we are always going to be a side thats going to be a little bit patchy because kids give you those inconsistencies
4044685 weve been very fortunate to have two or three very good senior players hold their consistency and im talking about shane wakelin and scott burns who are our oldest players
4044686 but then youve got jack anthony nathan brown john mccarthy chris dawes tyson goldsack sharrod wellingham
4044687 what are you going to get i want to have an enthusiastic group play good football but they are kids and they will be like that when youve got the inconsistency of youth you put up with it
4044688 its exciting its fantastic when you win i dont blame youth for losing but the inconsistency is sometimes a factor
4044689 you cant manufacture anything more than that finals are one of the greatest carrots in front of anyone and obviously collingwood have got it this week and for our guys its going to be motivationally very difficult
4044690 we did the right thing and the best thing for our club moving forward and thats as bad as it might seem the no 1 thing we have to consider the good and the life and the continuity of the club and you make decisions for long term rather than short term
4044691 we care that were really competitive right now and we want to win this week
4044692 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4044693 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4044694 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4044695 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4044696 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4044697 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4044698 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4044699 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4044700 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4044701 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4044702 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4044703 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4044704 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4044705 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4044706 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
4044707 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4044708 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4044709 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
4044710 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
4044711 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
4044712 the era of repression is over for ever dictatorship has become a tale of the past
4044713 for political reconciliation general musharraf has to quit reconciliation is not possible without it
4044714 the war against extremism and terrorism is a war for our own survival
4044715 were being told by western envoys that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
4044716 we are very clear that we have no role to play in this impeachment process britain has no interest in talking about the fate of individuals
4044717 i have to weigh up if its all worth it
4044718 im concerned about him because ive been told the same advice that hes been told
4044719 ill be concerned about him if he decides to play thats for sure
4044720 i think it says a lot about the character of the fellow that hes even thinking about playing
4044721 he knows things arent going to change too much with his arm in one week and hes basically putting his arm on the line for his team
4044722 you have to know the type of guy he is
4044723 some guys who arent team orientated it doesnt affect that much but hes a guy who is totally all about his teammates
4044724 here why dont you guys all take canoes out on the lake go all the way to the other side throw your paddles out of the canoe and then race back just using your hands first one back wins a buck for the snack bar
4044725 you want me to bury me in the sand sure you want me to drink this green water with floaty bits of black gunk in it sure you want me to pour sugar into my dads gas tank no problem
4044726 i strongly condemn the reign of terror let loose by the indian forces against the besieged people of kashmir
4044727 we are benefiting from one thing and that is the attack on the twin towers and pentagon and the american struggle in iraq
4044728 four or five years ago a suspicious event occurred in new york a building collapsed and they said that 3 000 people had been killed but never published their names
4044729 under this pretext they the u s attacked afghanistan and iraq and since then a million people have been killed only in iraq
4044730 the government of india has been watching with concern the spiraling violence in baluchistan and the heavy military action including use of helicopter gunships and jet fighters by the government of pakistan to quell it and we hope the government of pakistan will exercise restraint and take recourse to peaceful discussions to address the grievances of the people of baluchistan

4044874 each time i saw fr kolbe in the courtyard i felt within myself an extraordinary effusion of his goodness although he wore the same ragged clothes as the rest of us with the same tin can hanging from his belt one forgot his wretched exterior and was conscious only of the charm of his inspired countenance and of his radiant holiness
4044875 in the summer of 1941 most probably on the last day of juyl the camp siren announced that there had been an escape
4044876 after the group of doomed men had already been selected a prisoner stepped out from the ranks of one of the blocks i recognized fr kolbe owing to my poor knowledge of german i did not understand what they talked about nor do i remember whether fr kolbe spoke directly to fritzsch when making his request fr kolbe stood at attention and pointed at a former non commissioned officer known to me from the camp it could be inferred from the expression on fritzschs face that he was surprised at fr kolbes action as the sign was given fr kolbe joined the ranks of the doomed and the non commissioned officer left the ranks of the doomed firzsch had consented to the exchange a little later the doomed men were marched off in the direction of block 13 the death block

4044878 in the cell of the poor wretches there were daily loud prayers the rosary and singing in which prisnoers from neighbouring cells also joined when no ss men were in the block i went to the bunker to talk to the men and comfort them fervent prayers and songs to the holy mother resounded in all the corridors of the bunker i had the impression i was in a church fr kolbe was leading and the prisoners responded in unison they were often so deep in prayer that they did not even hear that inspecting ss men had descended to the bunker and the voices fell silent only at the loud yelling of their visitors when the cells were opened the poor wretches cried loudly and begged for a piece of bread and for water which they did not receive however if any of the stronger ones approached the door he was immediately kicked in the stomach by the ss men so that falling backwards on the cement floor he was instantly killed or he was shot to death fr kolbe bore up bravely he did not beg and did not complain but raised the spirits of the others since they had grown very weak prayers were now only whispered at every inspection when almost all the others were now lying on the floor fr kolbe was seen kneeling or standing in the centre as he looked cheerfully in the face of the ss men two weeks passed in this way meanwhile one after another they died until only fr kolbe was left this the authorities felt was too long the cell was needed for new victims so one day they brought in the head of the sickquarters a german a common criminal named bock who gave fr kolbe an injection of carbolic acid in the vein of his left arm fr kolbe with a prayer on his lips himself gave his arm to the executioner unable to watch this i left under the pretext of work to be done immediately after the ss men with the executioner had left i returned to the cell where i found fr kolbe leaning in a sitting position against the back wall with his eyes open and his head dropping sideways his face was calm and radiant
4044879 in those conditions in the midst of a brutalization of thought and feeling and words such as had never before been known man indeed became a ravening wolf in his relations with other men and into this state of affairs came the heroic self sacrifice of fr maximilian the atmosphere grew lighter as this thunderbolt provoked its profound and salutary shock
4044880 a shock filled with hope bringing new life and strength it was like a powerful shaft of light in the darkness of the camp

4044914 hampir saja para umat yang kafir dan sesat pen mengerumuni kalian dari berbagai penjuru sebagaimana mereka berkumpul menghadapi makanan dalam piring

4044917 hai orang orang mukmin jika kamu menolong agama allah niscaya dia akan menolongmu dan meneguhkan kedudukanmu
4044918 demikianlah apabila allah menghendaki niscaya allah akan membinasakan mereka tetapi allah hendak menguji sebahagian kamu dengan sebahagian yang lain

4044921 afwan akh ana telah ada pilihan yang lain ana mencintainya dan dia pun mencintai ana insya allah kami tinggal menunggu waktu saja semoga anta segera mendapatkan bidadari yang anta harapkan
4044922 alhamdulillaah akh ana nggak apa apa kok kalau dibilang sakit ya sedikit kalo dibilang kecewa yang pastilah ada tapi kembali lagi ana sangat bersyukur dengan semua ini mungkin agak aneh ya dapat sesuatu yang agak menyakitkan kok bersyukur sebenarnya pertama ana bersyukur karena ana telah behasil menyampaikan keinginan ana untuk menikahi dia anta tahu kan ana dari dulu paling nggak berdaya kalo berhadapan ma dia kedua ana bersyukur karena hati ana sangat lega udah dapat jawaban meski jawabannya nggak sesuai dengan yang ana harapkan ketiga ana bersyukur karena allah udah membuat ana mencintai dia dan ini jarang jarang lho akh ana bisa kayak gini keempat ana bersyukur karena ternyata dia bisa bahagia meski bukan dengan dan karena ana
4044923 ana mencintai dan ingin menikahinya karena ana ingin membahagiakannya tetapi jika ternyata tanpa ana ia bisa merasa bahagia kenapa ana harus bersedih ana memang sudah berniat dalam hati untuk berusaha membuatnya bahagia dengan cara apapan dan mungkin salah satunya dengan merelakan ia bersama ikhwan pilihannya itu dan saya bisa menangkap sekaligus merasakan kebahagiaan yang ia rasakan saat ini dengan ikhwan pilihannya tersebut jadi kenapa ana harus khawatir sekali lagi ana tegaskan bahwa ana mencintainya bukan karena ana ingin memilikinya namun semata mata ingin membuatnya bahagia jika ternyata saat ini ia bisa merasakan kebahagiaan maka berarti keinginan ana sudah tercapai bukan
4044924 sedikit sih tapi saya memang sudah siap untuk sakit hati atau kecewa karena cinta itu hanya bermuara pada dua pilihan iya atau tidak diterima atau ditolak kalu nggak siap ditolak ya nggak usah nembak kalo nggak siap sakit hati ya nggak usah nikah kita kan nggak pernah tahu apa yang akan kita hadapi jadi coba saja apapun hasilnya yang penting kita sudah berusaha saya bahagia kok ditolak seperti saya bahagia jika seandainya saya diterima
4044925 alhamdulillaah ana gak ngerasa gagal akh ana justru merasa telah berhasil
4044926 ya setidaknya ana telah berhasil dalam 2 hal pertama ana berhasil jujur pada diri ana pribadi dan juga padanya bahwa ana memang benar benar memiliki niat yang tulus dan serius padanya kedua ana telah berhasil membuat dia bahagia dengan merelakannya bersama dengan orang yang dia cintai
4044927 cinta memang sangat aneh akh mungkin sudah saatnya kita harus sedikit merubah paradigma berpikir kita cinta itu bukan untuk memiliki tapi untuk membahagiakan jika kita mencintai untuk memiliki maka kita mencintainya seperti cinta seorang diktator yang akan melakukan segala cara untuk memilikinya sehingga cenderung bersikap egois dan mengekang jika kita mencintai untuk membahagiakannya maka kita mencintainya seperti cinta orang tua yang akan melakukan segala cara untuk membuatnya merasa nyaman dan bahagia meski mungkin ia tidak sadar dan tidak mengakui cinta kita
4044928 ana tambah pusing trus apa ini artinya anta sudah berhenti untuk mengejarnya
4044929 cinta adalah bagaimana engkau membahagiakan orang yang engkau cintai dengan begitulah engkau merasa bahagia dan dengan begitulah engkau mencintainya cinta adalah bagaimana engkau bahagia saat orang yang engkau cintai merasa bahagia dengan begitulah engkau merasa bahagia dan dengan begitulah engkau mencintainya

4044943 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
4044944 we continue to evaluate our liquidity and our alternatives to improve the balance sheet
4044945 well continue to look at that to make sure that we have adequate liquidity to successfully implement this very significant kind of transformation
4044946 that is our intent but also i dont want to walk away from the fact that theres lots of variables hitting this business every day
4044947 our role is to make sure that were as flexible as we can be to kind of take those things coming at us both the good and the bad
4044948 what we really need to do is tell people that were back in the car business
4044949 the special committee is confident in the companys strong financial and clinical momentum and its uniquely productive research and development capabilities
4044950 it allows them to pinpoint where they want to drill

4044952 we are delighted to have secured an entry into the highly attractive u s pipe and tube market
4044953 the markets of pipes and hollow structural sections are not linked with the consumers demand and are therefore more favorable
4044954 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
4044955 we need to respond to increased ridership and other customer needs
4044956 but the first week everybodys back in school it will really be packed
4044957 we will create expectations and we have to work to make sure we meet them
4044958 we dont want to invite people to a party and then have a bad time
4044959 are a test of this market weve received a lot of requests for later service
4044960 sometimes we stay in center city for the theater and dinner and late trains might help then
4044961 when i have to go to the airport early there arent any trains running even 5 a m would be better
4044962 is all good the only thing id like to see is things they cant do because they dont have the equipment
4044963 id like to see more trains or more train capacity but theyre making maximum use of the equipment they have
4044964 they feel they are producing something as safe and secure as their relationship with the lord

4044966 we deal more on the handshake personal commitment look the grower in the eye
4044967 if you have a quality product consistently packaged dont top dress by taking the worst and putting it on the bottom all that is the way you build your name here at the auction
4044968 campbell would represent a nice fit with the company we are always looking for opportunities to expand and grow
4044969 our third quarter results for revenues contracts and backlog reflect the continued weakness in most of our markets
4044970 im talking on a microscopic basis traffic remains dismal but it is consistent and while it hasnt gotten worse for last three quarters it doesnt make us feel that comfortable
4044971 given the current state of the market we are not comfortable giving earnings guidance
4044972 there will be an increased focus on limiting the number of suppliers we sign contracts with the idea is to work more in partnerships to have a better economic and strategic view of the services being provided
4044973 fifteen would be ideal we want firms that can understand our strategy and work with us in the long term
4044974 we had plenty of meetings where we illustrated our new strategic plan by using our internal expertise but sometimes it is hard to force some people to do exactly as they are told
4044975 the federal trade commission is committed to exercising its authority to determine whether crude oil gasoline or petroleum distillates price increases at wholesale are a result of illegal market manipulation
4044976 todays out of control petroleum markets cant be explained by normal market fundamentals
4044977 i hope that aggressive action by the federal trade commission can burst the energy price bubble
4044978 water has no colour no race no nationality it is the same all over the world
4044979 so far nothing will change the situation because investors are expecting chinas economy to slow in the next two years
4044980 institutional investors have been cautious because they werent fully convinced that the u s economic slowdown would affect china but now they get it
4044981 the total project cost is 18 08 billion rupees to be completed by december 2010
4044982 het was absoluut onaanvaardbaar je maakt op deze manier inbreuk op iemands leven en daar heb ik spijt van
4044983 het was meer bedoeld voor ludieke acties zoals het vals bestellen van artikelen uit de wehkampgids of zo ik erken mijn verantwoordelijkheid voor de publicaties maar ik heb zelf nooit iemand bedreigd en vind dit ook zeer verwerpelijk
4044984 dat leidde tot bedreigingen bij mij aan huis en bij mijn collegas ook zijn er bij mij ruiten ingegooid ik ben een keer om het gevaar te keren op een zaterdagavond met een hockeystick naar buiten gegaan
4044985 soms lijkt het wel of ik verantwoordelijk word gehouden voor alles wat in de jaren tachtig gebeurd is gelukkig zit ik bij een partij die mensen een tweede kans geeft als zij in het verleden fouten hebben gemaakt ik heb spijt van wat ik gedaan heb maar ik heb geen levenslang
4044986 theres nothing on my album that youre gonna hear that i dont relate to or that i havent experienced because the only way i know how to sing is from life experience
4044987 it doesnt matter how he hurts you with his hands or with his words you dont deserve it it aint worth it take your heart and run
4044988 but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run
4044989 most people believe jessica is talking about being abused by a former boyfriend jessica was abused as a teenager while attending j j pearce high school in richardson texas long before she met nick lachey or any of her ex boyfriends
4044990 jessica was well developed and every guy in high school wanted her and practically every girl hated her
4044991 jessica put on a brave face but it was a campaign of terror that just devastated her
4044992 a nasty clique of girls constantly spread rumors about jessica and one that spread like wildfire was that she was gay

4045006 housebuilders shares fell between 7 15 percent across the sector yesterday no doubt in anticipation of a gloomy trading update from bellway this morning but even after taking into account of this falls the sector remains around 70 percent above its july lows
4045007 we continue to believe that the relief rally following barratts refinancing deal has been overdone and that we will see share price weakness in the lead up to the reporting season which started today
4045008 ill be surprised if they start maybe one of them will
4045009 its unfortunate that they mphela and gaxa left but we used the money to replace them with even better players with the offers we got for them it was better to accept the money and let them go in the end we got money in the bank and a trophy league championship what more can we ask for
4045010 most of my players are still not fully match fit they are still in pre season and thats why we got caught by pirates when they scored the opening goal
4045011 he has helped me a lot he believed in me when i first came here he gave me chances even though i wasnt scoring goals and ill always be thankful for that
4045012 the good thing at supersport is that we are all equal we dont tell ourselves that we are superstars even though we know we have the talent we work as a team when im not scoring im creating goals and that helps the team
4045013 ive won the league in my first season here at united so im happy here
4045014 it is impossible to go back there my home that i built myself does not exist now
4045015 even if the war stops the atrocities and the russians will stay there they only call themselves peacekeepers but in reality they are aggressors
4045016 i did not want to leave my village at all i travelled 90 kilometres by foot sleeping rough with my wife son and grandson it is terrifying to see what was happening there
4045017 if there was a guarantee that the land is ours i would go back on foot even at night but if the peacekeepers stay there i am afraid for the life of my grandchildren
4045018 how is it possible to escape bombs bombs do not spare neither old nor young
4045019 i will only go home if there is no war and if the land is georgian i will only go back in that case i want to live with georgians i do not want to live with ossetians
4045020 i will go back home of course if there is a chance of that but how can i do that

4045023 i have one eye looking very closely at developments back home i speak to people i have family there but im not going to rush anything
4045024 ive been here a long time i have a family here and its not just a case of upping and leaving and going back theres a lot to take into account i know a lot of zimbabwean professionals who are in a similar situation
4045025 i need to be able to go back and set myself up with a job that allows me to provide for my family both my immediate family and the extended family and that is not going to happen overnight
4045026 political stability is essential and other things will fall into place after that but it will take time
4045027 right now the risk takers are already taking up positions
4045028 even the regular man on the street in zimbabwe right now is very entrepreneurial he has to be or otherwise he wont make enough to survive i think that entrepreneurial spirit is going to be carried forward and so people will have to be sharp
4045029 a lot of colleagues and professionals living here in england have already developed their networks back home for me it wouldnt take me more than a few months to go back even if it might take five years for the situation to really turn around or even for the exchange rate to stabilise
4045030 there are many many people who would want to return and contribute to the rebuilding of zimbabwe but there is still uncertainty and a lack of clarity about what role the diaspora would play
4045031 there are people who have been tortured raped people whose families have been killed do they want to return right away without knowing if there will be justice
4045032 i think many people will wait to see how the situation develops to make sure that there is no longer violence that inflation has gone down perhaps it will be one or two years
4045033 i think you will see zimbabweans making new ties testing the water to go back but not leaving everything theyve got here because they cant afford to go back and lose everything
4045034 until recently austria canada france germany the united kingdom and the united states of america have been the main destinations for asylum seekers arriving in industrialized countries
4045035 we are delighted with the popularity of fishtext and feedback so far indicates that users are extremely pleased with the service
4045036 fishtexts success demonstrates that traditional text messaging is an overpriced and underdeveloped service many users have expressed surprise that the fishtext mobile application delivers text messages all over the world so reliably for just a couple of pence while their own operator charges over ten times that amount with some not even providing delivery reports or charging extra for them
4045037 iphone and nokia owners who regularly call north america can purchase truphones bundle to get peace of mind pricing of just 1 5 us cents 0 75 pence per minute to the usa and canada from anywhere in the world people dont want to calculate precise per minute rates or check tariff websites or take a paid for tariff bolt on to get a still high rate they simply want to feel comfortable about what theyre going to pay for the call they want to make
4045038 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments
4045039 operators need to take better control of their network assets so that they can offer a bespoke service to each user on a case by case basis
4045040 in a competitive european market where operators are increasingly trying to differentiate their service and the many millions of corporate subscribers are becoming increasingly international operators surely have no choice but to ensure they maximise all mobile broadband revenue opportunities whilst offering subscribers the best possible service

4045050 good email delivered to the inbox is welcomed but people hate spam and are equally frustrated when valid email is unnecessarily blocked however the picture has improved significantly in recent years today all the parties involved in email marketing recognise that they have to collaborate if the industry is to combat spam and ensure that the medium achieves its potential
4045051 a growing spirit of openness has seen isps become richer sources of information which in turn enables email marketers to respond by using the sophisticated capabilities of lyris listmanager 10 everyone wins because less spam is delivered and more legitimate messages get in to the inbox
4045052 ensuring that email messages make it to the inbox continues to be a critical challenge for email marketers particularly as spam volumes increase and internet service providers isps change their guidelines for which messages get delivered
4045053 our results show that almost half of people questioned felt they had bought their endowment policy on a false promise this is not just a case of a small purchase this is thousands of pounds for a house that we are talking about
4045054 there are several reasons that somebody may have been mis sold an endowment policy including a lack of adequate explanation an endowment policy is not a short term commitment and this should have been made clear when the policy was bought as should the fees and risks involved
4045055 without this information people were unable to make an informed decision and should be able to claim some compensation depending on the circumstances
4045056 the online retail market is fiercely competitive consumers expect to be able to shop quickly and easily even minor glitches in this process will lead customers to abandon their trolleys and go elsewhere

4045058 with over 40 years experience in information security and having worked closely with the information security forum it is clear that its role is more important than ever
4045059 information security is no longer just a technical challenge it is a business imperative and is or should be on the top of boardroom agendas in every corporation the isf is a unique organization that provides a confidential peer to peer forum for members across different countries sectors and disciplines and is able to draw on their diverse skills and expertise to distill best practice and deliver an unmatched portfolio of research methodologies and tools
4045060 it is a distinct privilege to be the first president of the isf and i look forward to working with the dedicated professionals that have brought the isf to the position it is today i will strive to help raise greater awareness of the information security challenges faced today from the increase in cybercrime to the growing burden of compliance companies need to adopt a risk management perspective and recognize that information security is business driven and not crisis driven
4045061 we are delighted that howard schmidt has accepted this important position at the isf
4045062 the value of the isf has always been born out of the people in the organization its members our expert consultants and the management team it is clear that howards unparalleled experience and knowledge will make a major contribution to the future of the isf and its members he will also be driving our ambitious plans to expand the scale and reach of the isf building on our existing membership from europe and scandinavia through the americas to the middle east india africa australia and the pacific rim
4045063 the timing is right for this demonstration weve seen a massive increase of interest in targeted advertising and are already working with iptv broadcasters network owners and vendors not to mention advertising agencies and brands mobile tv is a vital part of the rapidly changing world of tv and is a vital part of our roadmap like packet vision udcast is a pioneer in its particular area of innovation with a proven track record and global reach so there is a natural synergy between the two companies
4045064 we expect targeted advertising to be an important element of mobile tv business models including free to air services where finding ways to generate revenue from advertising will be essential udcasts mobile tv solutions are compliant with majority of standards deployed across the world we are in an ideal position to provide the global platform for delivering mobile tv so it makes sense to work with packet vision which we believe is at the forefront of delivering targeted advertising technology on ip video networks
4045065 local councils can find out the number and cause of avoidable contacts which is the first step to reducing them
4045066 the fact that simple transactions are increasingly satisfied by consumer self service internet and systems means person to person contacts tend to be more complex and take longer
4045067 reducing avoidable contact gives more capacity to handle unavoidable contacts more effectively and reduce overall workload

4045072 there are lots of options for young people to build a successful career in their industry of choice however if youre young and starting to make money its a good idea to start thinking about saving for the future nobodys young forever
4045073 many 16 21 year olds now make the choice to go straight to work rather than university and as a result are very career driven we think it is important to recognise those who are just starting out in their working life and offer them support especially in the first stages of their professional lives when they are likely to be making important financial decisions
4045074 with this in mind the premier 21 account has been launched to allow this group to maximise the potential of their hard earned cash the account offers a 10 interest rate the highest credit interest rate on the high street to help make their money go further
4045075 its a feel good system that allows us to relax
4045076 people who are sexually promiscuous are more likely to engage in sensation seeking

4045082 i discovered a notebook where i had these kind of phrases
4045083 i think i was so fed up with everything that it was easy to get this kind of character that was completely like affected by reality
4045084 guatemala is a very violent society so it is very easy to get paranoid
4045085 the known total of all those killed in war and repression during the 1970s and the 1980s throughout the rest of the western hemisphere
4045086 impunity remains the rule when it comes to human rights violations
4045087 n one of us could have imagined the full horror and magnitude of what actually happened
4045088 t he predominance of the military aspects of the guerrilla struggle coupled with organizational rigidity bred insensitivity toward suffering
4045089 doesnt want to be there he doesnt want to recognize that he is being affected not only by what hes reading but by the whole situation in that suppressed society
4045090 if you are urban middle class or you are in the capital city you dont want to know all the killing that is happening outside thats why these societies recycle violence because societies are not dealing with what happened
4045091 it isnt clear whether the editors aestheticizing of traumatic utterance is intended to inspire our wonder for the indigenous or our contempt for the narrator
4045092 about the only thing were sure of at the end of senselessness is that the victims of genocide have not yet found a witness worthy of them
4045093 this carefully arranged mix of many bits of testimony and a dearth of complete scenes of brutality gives the reader the impression of advancing into the dark surrounded by a cemetery of voices portending terrors that will be fully realized toward the end of the book
4045094 the process by which the victims testimony gradually engulfs the narrators consciousness is senselessness most impressive achievement yet the tragedy of mass death is overcome by moyas perverse sense of humor as morbid and resilient as a laughing skull
4045095 the only writer of my generation that knows how to narrate the horror the secret vietnam that latin america was for a long time
4045096 was the first novel i read by a latin american of my own age and it showed me that young writers were finding their own ways of renewing the novel
4045097 there is almost nothing in the middle in a political way
4045098 they are still very polarized with that mentality there is no way of doing thinking there is no way of doing anything
4045099 i would consider moya one of the most important writers in the region today
4045100 ends up finding a new way of criticizing the society about which it is written
4045101 the novel works to undermine its own cynicism or that of the narrator
4045102 p erhaps closer to the way in which common people deal with atrocity in those societies because you are not complaining every day you have to live
4045103 its touching some really sensitive things for guatemala and the latin american people
4045104 publicly call this guy out as a torturer and a murderer
4045105 i was just trying to show an archetype not any particular person
4045106 when i did most of my novels that are known i didnt have a life as a writer

4045136 and we know that for those who love god all things work together for good for those who are called according to his purpose
4045137 for he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight in love he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through jesus christ in accordance with his pleasure and will
4045138 god has made everything beautiful in his time also he has set the world in their heart so that no mand can find out the work that god makes from the beginning to the end

4045159 non so cosa ha in mente berlusconi quando azzarda queste previsioni spero che le sue parole riflettano la consapevolezza di doversi assumere piena responsabilit della situazione economica condividendola con le parti sociali finora la nostra classe dirigente ha saputo costruire solo uno schema di bipolarismo muscolare s impegnata in una costante ricerca della contrapposizione fine a se stessa evitando di misurarsi con il governo di processi abbandonati da anni ma quando si trascurano i problemi delleconomia poi si arriva alla guerra tra poveri oggi lo sport nazionale dare addosso a chi si trova in difficolt ci si accanisce perfino sui mendicanti vedo che in molti ambienti si lavora per un autunno caldo
4045160 se per questo lo va ripetendo dal primo giorno del nuovo governo io mantengo la stessa cautela adottata quando avevamo di fronte prodi anche allora la cgil voleva scendere in piazza e invece abbiamo avuto ragione noi perch poi laccordo sul welfare s fatto
4045161 io voglio stanare il governo capire cosa possiamo ottenere purtroppo c chi non offre mai una spinta per risolvere i problemi ma solo per denunciarli bisogna stare attenti altrimenti si d la sensazione di voler accendere dei fuochi di paglia in funzione politica anzich tutelare gli interessi dei lavoratori
4045162 non lo so io voglio che la detassazone del salario di produttivit diventi strutturale e che si superino i veti incrociati dei mille poteri allopera nel paese per raggiungere un accordo sulle priorit negli investimenti infrastrutturali giudicheremo su questo baster un briciolo di pazienza per capire quali sono le vere intenzioni del governo subito dopo lestate sar tutto chiaro

4045202 my gut feeling is that players will be gearing their game towards the twenty20 format more than the five day format
4045203 the new generation of 15 to 20 year olds are they going to gear themselves towards travelling the world for nine months of the year playing five day cricket or earn plenty by playing three hour cricket a little bit in india and at home im not too sure

4045207 theyre throwing out those who would compromise who they thought didnt have pure blood that leaves a lot of moderates for the democrats
4045208 im just glad to get it behind us its important for us to close ranks now
4045209 the two races show that in the republican party theres a struggle
4045210 what you found in republican primaries the more conservatives those that lean libertarian want more representation in the republican party
4045211 you know what you call a senator who won by one vote senator
4045212 for many that task has been more difficult than in the past
4045213 the claims made in the counter suit by joe francis are not only false but scurrilous beyond imagination
4045214 mr francis obviously felt secure making such defamatory statements under the protection of a judicial pleading
4045215 however he has recently made other false and defamatory public statements we not only intend to press the proper charges for collection of his gambling debts but we will also pursue mr francis for damages resulting from those incredibly damaging and libelous statements each and every statement made by mr francis is an outrageous falsehood and he will be held accountable for those statements
4045216 suffered injury to his reputation shame mortification hurt feelings and emotional distress
4045217 falsely imply that the hotel did not keep contractual agreements with francis and that the hotel did not do business with francis in a fair and ethical manner the statements falsely imply that francis possesses some undisclosed facts that show that wynn deceives customers
4045218 intentionally miscalculates markers and forges the high rollers signatures in order to change a win to a loss
4045219 they should be interested in looking into this conduct but im skeptical that they will because the industry protects itself
4045220 once we get our hands on it we certainly will look into the allegations
4045221 originally i had gone into cosmetology but that wasnt for me im not good with people
4045222 i have a type a personality people complained about me about how i come off im pretty blunt with people
4045223 the dog has to sense that you know what youre doing if you walk up to a dog and youre afraid of it they may turn around and bite you
4045224 so take command theyll do what you want if you take control
4045225 the dog had been rescued that same day it had been abused it didnt growl it didnt bark it didnt pull away from me but when i leaned over to do his toenails and i picked his paw up i must have set him off
4045226 he bit my upper lip off just that fast an inch and a half
4045227 dogs do things out of instinct people do things out of spite
4045228 maybe this is going to be another little side benefit of our slower growth

4045233 once you sit in the front you will come up with the money no matter what
4045234 my son has pretty much grown up with these people theyre like family to him we have to keep it going

4045247 people who go against the standard line of the organization feel like theyre not just expressing a difference of opinion but that theyre traitors
4045248 i knew what was going on before but it wasnt my part to blow any whistles or anything like that
4045249 the old way of doing things sounds to me so grueling and awful
4045250 its one of the things that kept me out of the business for a long time the story was that to make it big you have to drive around in a stinky van up and down the east coast and play to empty houses the van breaks down youre eating fast food youre up late and driving all day
4045251 its great to have someone say i love your songs
4045252 its even better to have them say heres a music video i made
4045253 they are culture geeks as well theyre interested in things like battlestar galactica and world of warcraft they might be carrying action figures with them
4045254 you get addicted to spikes in traffic and you get depressed when the spikes go away

4045257 im just saying you look like youre either having a really good day or youre up to something sneaky

4045261 popcorn is a contentious issue lots of people absolutely hate it and have asked us to ban it so were going to do exactly that
4045262 if its a success and ive no reason to suspect it wont be well roll it out across all our cinemas and make it a permanent fixture
4045263 it has a disproportionate influence on the space in terms of its overwhelming smell the cultural idea of it and the operational problems created by the mess it produces
4045264 im not saying no popcorn is better than popcorn but i am saying there is no way in which it fits with the culturally sophisticated brand i wish to sell

4045305 our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms
4045306 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4045307 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4045308 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4045341 rot und schwarz sollen damit aufh ren mit einer sicherheitsmogelpackung ihre maroden gemeinden zu sanieren
4045342 wie lange will man jene menschen die aus mangel an vern nftigen m glichkeiten im ffentlichen verkehr zum pendeln mit dem auto gezwungen sind noch schikanieren
4045343 angesichts der explodierenden kriminalit t in st p lten verwehre ich mich dagegen dass duzende exekutivbeamte zur schikanierung der autofahrer herangezogen werden anstatt das ausufernde verbrechen an der wurzel zu packen
4045344 gerade deshalb sind wir auch ber die entscheidung der datenschutzkommission gl cklich denn die privaten sheriffs haben in der ersten h lfte dieses jahres bereits 76 000 autofahrer gnadenlos abgezockt wenn die gemeindeverbandsvertreter von rot und schwarz nun hergehen und mit dem sicherheitsargument kommen weise ich daraufhin dass es in wirklichkeit nur um die sanierung ihrer maroden zu tode spekulierten kommunen geht
4045345 der autofahrer der am heimweg zuerst von der exekutive abgezockt und danach im heimatort nochmals von privaten radars ldnern ausgenommen wird hat genug gelitten
4045346 keinesfalls m chte ich behaupten dass in der wissenschaftspolitik absolut nichts weitergegangen ist aber der fortschritt lie sich mit freiem auge nicht erkennen die erh hung der studienbeihilfe auf druck der sp gewisse vorarbeiten im forschungsdialog oder ein begutachtungsentwurf f r das universit tsgesetz zeigen dass es minister hahn eher auf die gem tliche art angegangen ist

4045352 einmal mehr m chte ich unmissverst ndlich klarstellen dass der n landesfeuerwehrverband die aufnahme von m dchen in die feuerwehrjugend und von frauen in den aktivdienst der freiwilligen feuerwehren begr t und f rdert
4045353 wir wissen dass es in zukunft verst rkt notwendig ist aktiv werbung f r frauen bei der feuerwehr zu betreiben um die tageseinsatzbereitschaft in gewohntem umfang gew hrleisten zu k nnen frauen sind k rperlich in der lage die aufgaben bei der feuerwehr zu bew ltigen selbst atemschutzger tetr gerinnen sind keine seltenheit mehr
4045354 nach dem n feuerwehrgesetz steht die entscheidung ber die aufnahme neuer mitglieder dem kommando der jeweiligen feuerwehr zu der n landesfeuerwehrverband hat nach dem gesetz keine m glichkeit die entscheidung f r oder gegen eine bestimmte person zu beeinflussen
4045355 wir k nnen auf die schlagkraft der frauen nicht mehr verzichten wir m ssen jedoch bei einzelnen feuerwehren weiterhin aufkl rungsarbeiten leisten denn die feuerwehr der zukunft wird auch auf frauen setzen m ssen nur so k nnen wir unser freiwilligensystem aufrecht erhalten
4045356 sie sind in den verschiedensten funktionen in unserer organisation t tig etwa als sachbearbeiterin feuerwehrkommandantin und auch auf funktion rsebene zahlreiche frauen haben bereits das goldene feuerwehrleistungsabzeichen erlangt und sind somit auch in der elite unserer aktiven mitglieder vertreten
4045357 ich will unmissverst ndlich festhalten wir m chten k nftig noch mehr frauen als mitglieder in den n freiwilligen feuerwehren und wir bem hen uns redlich dieses ziel auch zu erreichen

4045365 i have written to the devon partnership trust and to the county council urging them to recognise the urgent need for local specialist employment services for the disabled such as those pluss provides it is essential that these opportunities that can only be made available by the kind of persistent and far reaching work that pluss does are afforded to many more people in torridge and west devon

4045377 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4045378 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle

4045401 zu der zeit kaufte roger eine menge philippinische action filme ber schwarze frauen die leute abknallen wir haben einen trailer f r einen unglaublichen flop gemacht als wir merkten dass wir als regisseure bessere arbeit abliefern konnten wenn man f r einen trailer einen film auf das wesentliche reduziert lernt man den kern des films kennen es ist besser als eine filmschule glauben sie mir von jedem film kann man viel lernen egal wie schrecklich er ist
4045402 manche leute sagen casablanca oder citizen kane ich sage jason und die argonauten ist der beste film der je gedreht wurde
4045403 fantasy ist im grunde eine traumwelt eine erdichtete welt und ich glaube nicht dass man sie ganz realistisch haben will man will eine interpretation die realit t soll in phantasie verwandelt werden f r mich ergibt stop motion animation diesen mehrwert einer traumwelt den man nicht kriegt wenn man es zu realistisch macht

4045408 so that russia would be a maritime and naval power this work is underway maybe it is slower than we would like to do it but we got down to it for the first time in the last 20 years
4045409 that allows for one of the carriers to be at sea in each theater at all times with three carrier groups in each fleet main staging base you are able to at the same time have one on station one returning to port for rest and refitting and a third in port undergoing re fitting to be ready to replace the group currently on station

4045412 there is a very serious concern that this horse could have a relapse of this disease
4045413 this disease has already seen two people hospitalised and in a very serious condition
4045414 i think most people in the industry understand while its very sad protecting the industry does involve these sorts of very difficult decisions
4045415 these people were innocently doing something with the horse and became critically ill as a result of it
4045416 so from that point of view i have to support the unfortunate course of action that has to be taken
4045417 its very important that that part of the world keeps playing cricket
4045418 obviously those countries are struggling but if it doesnt happen i hope they do whatever they need to rectify the situation
4045419 i really cant say until i hear from aca and cricket australia
4045420 once again im going to have to look at that report and see what it says i cant commit either way at the moment
4045421 if we do go itll be on the basis of that all has been taken care of and that unease factor will hopefully be removed
4045422 theres obviously something going on although im only hearing it second hand
4045423 we are always going to be a side thats going to be a little bit patchy because kids give you those inconsistencies
4045424 weve been very fortunate to have two or three very good senior players hold their consistency and im talking about shane wakelin and scott burns who are our oldest players
4045425 but then youve got jack anthony nathan brown john mccarthy chris dawes tyson goldsack sharrod wellingham
4045426 what are you going to get i want to have an enthusiastic group play good football but they are kids and they will be like that when youve got the inconsistency of youth you put up with it
4045427 its exciting its fantastic when you win i dont blame youth for losing but the inconsistency is sometimes a factor
4045428 you cant manufacture anything more than that finals are one of the greatest carrots in front of anyone and obviously collingwood have got it this week and for our guys its going to be motivationally very difficult

4045434 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4045435 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4045436 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4045437 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and of georgia be respected
4045438 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4045439 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4045440 the three parties are unable to reach a consensus on islam indeed we have differences which should be overcome before they break up the coalition
4045441 politics is so unpredictable we cannot depend on others in the long term we need to fortify our strengths so that we can still survive on our own should we leave pr one day
4045442 we found that we obtained a lot of support from non muslims in the march 8 general election this is one reason why we did very well this time it is beyond our expectations

4045521 our compliments for your blog we like it a lot
4045522 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill
4045523 the idea that there is a state called happiness and that we can dependably figure out what it feels like and how to measure it is extremely subversive
4045524 deep economy the wealth of communities and the durable future
4045525 it allows economists to start thinking about life in richer terms to stop asking what did you buy and to start asking is your life good
4045526 for the time being we know that happiness fosters physical health but not precisely how
4045527 chronic unhappiness activates the fight flight response which is known to involve harmful effects in the long run such as higher blood pressure and a lower immune response
4045528 if we feel unhealthy we go to a medical general practitioner
4045529 if we feel unhappy there is no such generalist we have to guess
4045530 professional guidance for a happier life is unavailable as yet this is a remarkable market failure given the large number of people who feel they could be happier

4045537 yes your story was good so good in fact were going to nick it and not pay for it
4045538 unsolicited storylines come free so too do brief outlines which put down on paper the gist of an idea in which you have expressed an interest if after discussion you ask a writer to prepare a full storyline to test the development of an idea this is a storyline commission and you are bound by writers guild agreements to pay for it

4045541 my guess is it was presented as this is the best i can get
4045542 french and russian officials were unavailable to comment on the georgian officials account of how the negotiations unfolded
4045543 that gives the russians undefined security rights in undefined territory in georgia thats an invitation to further problems
4045544 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4045545 we were unhappy with the initial actions of the american officials because they were perceived by the russians as green lines basically but this one was very strong
4045546 russia did not plan this action it was taken by surprise and had no option but to intervene in south ossetia
4045547 americas behaviour in georgia over the past years and especially the past month is seen in moscow as very provocative the us encouraged georgia to act maybe not directly but that was how mr saakashvili interpreted it and washington has now supported the georgian leadership on all points
4045548 demanded any settlement of the conflict in georgia be based on recognition of the smaller countrys territorial integrity
4045549 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4045550 we recognise the sovereignty of georgia but territorial integrity its another matter
4045551 south ossetia and abkhazia never were part of georgia as an independent country
4045552 they killed my neighbours 15 year old son everyone was fleeing in panic
4045553 the russian tanks arrived at our village at 11 20am we ran away we left everything our cattle our house and our possessions
4045554 they were killing burning and stealing my village isnt in a conflict zone its pure georgia

4045556 the cost of borrowing is up and there is growing concern about individual financial circumstances
4045557 parents and students across the board are feeling the pinch
4045558 we have made it a priority to reach out to students who are bright but dont have the resources
4045559 it has put some stress on us but were trying to meet it the best we can
4045560 we tell them you cant win the lottery unless you buy a ticket
4045561 i want to be in a program with people my age
4045562 we are the first brain injury association and there are 47 across the country who have successfully litigated and won
4045563 it was clear that a settlement strategy was the right strategy
4045564 if the person wants to be in the community and can be cared for there safely and effectively thats where they should be
4045565 many people with brain injuries can keep making gains for years with the right help
4045566 for people with brain injuries statewide the settlement will mean they can live independently in their own community close to family and friends
4045567 it paves the way for advocates in other states to bring similar actions
4045568 but youll pay the nursing home 80 000 a year to keep her here
4045569 we want to stay in our building its very much our home
4045570 the idea of coming to work every day under a microsoft sign is not so appealing to us
4045571 microsoft has a valid lease at the building that was negotiated in good faith
4045572 microsoft is committed to its partners and employees in massachusetts and looks forward to expanding its strong r amp d presence in cambridge
4045573 after blackstone took over their intent seemed to be to clear the building out
4045574 from their perspective making it the microsoft building is probably a lucrative investment strategy
4045575 asserted that microsofts presence would be a threat to the internet security of intersystems and claimed intersystems would now have to operate its business differently
4045576 the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
4045577 to show to russia that we can come to the aid of a european ally and that we can do it at will whenever and wherever we want
4045578 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4045579 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4045580 we were unhappy with the initial actions of the american officials but this one was very strong
4045581 we wont be protecting the airport or seaport but well certainly protect our assets if we need to
4045582 to continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4045583 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can invade its neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4045584 if he doesnt understand the situation well have to go further
4045585 he doesnt seem to understand that the russian army is much stronger than the georgian army his tanks remain in their places his air force is dead his navy is also his army is demoralized
4045586 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far

4045597 after all its not like they vote for us anyway
4045598 viewed objectively it appears to us to be likely that the extradition proceedings were used for an ulterior purpose namely to secure the appellants detention in custody in order to allow time for the authorities to provide evidence of a terrorist offence
4045599 to be ignorant of the past is to remain a child
4045600 if you can determine what a man thinks you do not have worry about what he will do if you can make a man believe that he is inferior you dont have to compel him to seek an inferior status he will do so without being told and if you can make a man believe that he is justly an outcast you dont have to order him to the back door
4045601 successes and disappointments the vices the follies and the quarrels of those who engage in contention for power
4045602 the thought of the inferiority of the negro is drilled into him in almost every class he enters and in almost every book he studies
4045603 youre going to relegate my history to a month i dont want a black history month black history is american history
4045604 the irony of it is that we still have to have a black history month to remind people that we have a history
4045605 our government had in its possession proof that not one japanese american citizen or not had engaged in espionage not one had committed any act of sabotage
4045606 were motivated largely by racial prejudice wartime hysteria and a failure of political leadership
4045607 future historians will record this evacuation this violation of citizenship rights as one of the blackest blots on american history
4045608 the excluded individuals of japanese ancestry suffered enormous damages both material and intangible and there were incalculable losses in education and job training all of which resulted in significant human suffering for which appropriate compensation has not been made
4045609 fears and prejudices directed against minority communities are too easy to evoke and exaggerate often to serve the political agendas of those who promote those fears i know what it is like to be at the other end of such scapegoating and how difficult it is to clear ones name after unjustified suspicions are endorsed as fact by the government

4045614 the problem with islam is if you speak out against islam you are a racist
4045615 wake up to the dangerous realities of the islamic faith
4045616 islam is not the religion of god islam is the devil
4045617 mr ananis not an individual who rates the slightest degree of credibility based on the stories that he has told
4045618 failure to list the affiliation on the citizenship application is enough to go back and open the file and charge them with fraud and perjury
4045619 and now they are admitting to being former terrorists so under the real id act thats enough for their removal from the
4045620 walid shoebat is either a self admitted criminal or complete fraud in either case the public and law enforcement authorities have a right to know
4045621 we are concerned that a self confessed ex terrorist is walking free in this country simply because he has converted to christianity and supports this countrys policies toward israel

4045623 i can tell you is probably considered one of the largest centers of islamic radical activity outside the

4045634 this is perhaps the most critical issue facing public education in a generation
4045635 nysut members are property taxpayers too and they too want relief but not at the expense of their schools and school children
4045636 political expediency over the future of new yorks children and public schools
4045637 this is a very unstable part of the world and i dont need it to be more unstable
4045638 right now im fighting two wars and i dont need a third one
4045639 diplomatic malpractice on a carter esque level that is breathing new life into a failing regime
4045640 as ahmadinejad begins his re election campaign he can say he has successfully brought washington to its knees through blunt defiance murder of us troops and holocaust denial
4045641 despite all of this despite north korean nuclear aid to one of the worlds leading terrorist regimes and despite its subsequent failure to account for its nuclear programs in june the bush administration volunteered to lift sanctions on north korea under the trading with the enemy act and over the objection of our close ally japan decided to remove north korea from the state departments list of state sponsors of terror
4045642 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months and the leaders in washington and even tehran should hope that the attack will be successful enough to cause at least a significant delay in the iranian production schedule if not complete destruction of that countrys nuclear program
4045643 i believe he would say its his child for his buddy
4045644 i think his loyalty to edwards is very strong he was just part of his team
4045645 very loyal and dedicated to his family and to edwards
4045646 seemed to be crazy about their kids and crazy about each other
4045647 he shouldnt let his friend andrew take the blame for him
4045648 theres no way shed agree to letting him stay with her if

4045721 as soon as we start doing this i guarantee well find less of them because theyre going to get smart and change the way they do business
4045722 then well be back to tracking them down and putting it all together like a puzzle and thats when it gets real messy
4045723 they shut down at one location move across the street to another change the name and its basically the same individuals
4045724 this underscores the difference between responsible operators which are our core members and the unlawful rogues who imperil public safety

4045747 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4045748 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4045749 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4045750 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4045751 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4045752 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4045753 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4045754 the price of the hardware is driving up the price they are also aiming to make the monogram line more high end in this specific collection
4045755 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
4045756 political stability in my view can only be brought through a reconciliation approach as opposed to confrontation
4045757 the era of repression is over forever dictatorship has become a tale of the past
4045758 for political reconciliation general musharraf has to quit reconciliation is not possible without it

4045780 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4045781 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4045782 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4045783 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4045784 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4045785 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4045786 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4045787 jade wasnt sure when she was first approached because she was worried about how the indian housemates and public might react

4045789 i will be able to empathise with the people in the house better because i have been through the experience and i know what they will be going through at that point of time

4045796 the initial concept for prey b arf had been incubating for a while waiting for the right opportunity to come along
4045797 we jumped at the chance to create this game with a talented developer like human head studios wait i thought i was doing this on my own and next generation technology like the doom 3 engine game maker 7
4045798 prey is special for many reasons including several new and original gameplay features and a tightly integrated story that packs an emotional punch unlike other first person shooters
4045799 with their help prey is sure to breathe new life into the first person shooter genre with a compelling story innovative gameplay mechanics and dazzling imagery which is powered by our significantly enhanced version of id softwares original doom 3 engine

4045803 it something that we tried to reach for many years and years
4045804 the offered reforms are projected to involve parents and trustees in discussions and decision making with young men about body piercing
4045805 the possible applications of health linked to piercing of a body can switch on transmission of the viruses transferred by blood infections cicatrisations and nerve damages
4045806 this device fast fix which is not engaged in a problem original cause and it is illegible
4045807 i think what is it a strong symptom of that i name a malaise at the heart of our society
4045808 i am very interested that i see to be an appearing working split between youth and old pavors absence of tolerance even hatred high generation to youth
4045809 imagine the protest if the device has been entered which has called the common discomfort to people of one race or a floor instead of to our children
4045810 for the mosquito is not present any place in the country which estimates its children and aspires to inoculate them with advantage and respect
4045811 we speak to owners of shop to use it when they have a problem and i would be more than is happy to enter the contract which provides to owners of shop as it can be used
4045812 people speak about encroaching human rights but what concerning human rights of the owner of shop which sees its business crash because groups of disobedient teenagers drive away its clients
4045813 so the government will be putting out a draft bill by the end of the year so we can have feedback from the public as to whether or not the balance in that bill is appropriate
4045814 we want to get this legislation right but the governments preferred position is to ban intimate body piercing for anybody who is under the age of 18
4045815 there are a whole range of issues including health issues the permanency of scarring that can take place in relation to intimate body piercing
4045816 body piercings can be especially vulnerable for a poisoning as the output can enter a blood flow through punctured areas
4045817 sixteen to 18 year olds have the right to the compounded floor and to study to control a motor vehicle
4045818 children are coming home mutilated and disfigured with pins rings and studs embedded in all parts of their bodies and there is nothing parents can do to prevent it because this state does not have a minimum age for body piercing enshrined in legislation
4045819 ya jumlah 10 gol yang bersarang ke gawang persib dalam 5 pertandingan memang cukup banyak saya sudah menganalisisnya dan memang masih ada kelemahan di lini belakang yang harus saya benahi
4045820 yang pasti kekurangan dan kelemahan di barisan pertahanan masih ada itu saja yang harus diketahui publik soal apa kelemahannya itu cukup untuk saya dan tim pelatih yang akan membenahinya
4045821 agar dalam proses pembenahan bisa fokus saya selalu memisahkan para pemain belakang dalam setiap kali menjalani program latihan dengan begitu saya bisa memberikan materi latihan dan mengingatkan para pemain belakang dengan baik
4045822 khusus pembenahan lini belakang ini saya sudah instruksikan robby untuk fokus menanganinya saya percaya betul sebagai mantan pemain belakang yang tangguh robby punya cara dalam melakukan pembenahan tersebut
4045823 the club has never mentioned anything to me about having to leave because they have told me that they want me to stay
4045824 i have also been surprised to hear that i am going to leave the club when nothing of the sort has been mentioned to me i even spoke to roger de sa the other day and he told me that i am in his plans for the new season i am happy at wits and i am glad that you are getting this from me
4045825 saya pikir pemain tak terlalu terbebani dengan target harus menang saya tahu bagaimana kualitas pemain saya malah pemain ingin segera main di kandang untuk sebuah kemenangan
4045826 pertandingan pertama ini kami yakin bakal memberi yang terbaik bagi pendukung kami
4045827 we just need to talk some more when we meet that is all
4045828 we sent the call up letter but he has still not acknowledged receiving it we will have to wait and see what happens
4045829 we wrote him a letter asking him to clarify the statements attributed to him but he has still not responded even to that letter
4045830 mkhonza is a very good player but unfortunately he struggled to make it into the starting line up since joining us last season
4045831 we agreed to release him and give him a free clearance so that he can join a team of his choice
4045832 around 150 000 uk residents bought property abroad last year including in polaris world and the forecast for 2008 is a rise to around 165 000 so thats pretty buoyant
4045833 in recent years weve seen growth of as much as 25 in prices in traditional markets like southern spain but theres an acceptance that that will slow down
4045834 relative value and growth potential in the medium term are still there
4045835 the average uk detached house price is around 350 000 and you will get far more for that in the mature markets like spain again like in polaris world
4045836 while there is that difference between what you get for your money here versus abroad there are still acceptable returns for investors its the same with any market that is cooling down for the prudent buyer theres an opportunity people focus on quality and it becomes a buyers market
4045837 what we are seeing is a change in the traditional locations
4045838 thats why the focus has shifted to quality in regions like murcia like polaris world in the south and the basque country in the north discerning buyers are looking for quality and amenities and also looking for a flavour of the local lifestyle
4045839 the costa del sol was overdeveloped over the years so buying off plan with polaris world offers some affordable luxury in new homes two bedroom apartments start from 80 000 although you can buy big villas for up to 1 million polaris world offers all the services a buyer could conceivably want theyll service your home rent it for you even sell it on for you we can also advise on buying a polaris world property key ready that is one that is already complete and theres a level of comfort and reassurance that comes with dealing with a major company like polaris world
4045840 firstly your home should be on a golf course golfers extend the rental period greatly if you are buying to let but there are so many courses in southern spain that the course itself must be recognised thats why having the nicklaus golf trail is a big plus for polaris world
4045841 the resort has to be big enough in terms of amenities polaris world has shops bars restaurants and pools and there are five star intercontinental hotels on three of the polaris world developments and if you are looking to rent your property out regularly it should be within 20 minutes from an airport that applies to all polaris world s developments
4045842 the facilities and amenities particularly if you are buying as an investment to let are really important your needs for using a property as a holiday home will quite often differ from the needs of your prospective tenants so make sure you know why you are buying the property
4045843 we can manage exposure to this through our overseas payment service
4045844 but you must include in your budget the chance that the difference between the pound and the euro can change quickly in fact over the past 12 months there have been times when the pound has weakened against the euro by as much as 14
4045845 they need some creativity upfront and some inventiveness in the team generally
4045846 and how not to relax when an opposing team is down
4045847 for personal philosophical reasons i believe that it is not for us that we do not have the right to voluntarily put an end to life but i do not want to evade my responsibilities i would like make a discussion with the sick person his doctor and the family a priority in all humanity so that the most appropriate solution for each situation can be found
4045848 as a result of preliminary investigations we have suspended four students and those students will remain suspended until we have further details from the police he said
4045849 that anyone could come into the school after hours and take advantage of defenceless animals that have been lovingly cared for by our students is disappointing he said
4045850 there will be consequences for the students according to their level of involvement
4045851 the college has put procedures in place to manage the wellbeing of all students
4045852 it is run for years 9 12 and we would have 150 plus kids involved including vce level to prepare them for university it is not a mickey mouse subject he said
4045853 the premier spending a week or two there in china doesnt hide the fact nsw is unrepresented for the remaining 50 weeks of the year
4045854 given the huawei deal alone is a multi million agreement for sydney the cost of the mission is relatively small
4045855 it was investigating a number of historical sexual assaults which took place in the 1970s and 80s in relation to young males commander odell said
4045856 strike force georgiana has a number of complaints that theyre looking at so inquiries are ongoing
4045857 weve obtained statements that support the offences that were putting before the court and weve certainly had that support and the involvement of a number of victims and witnesses
4045858 we believe that this will save substantial sums of money that we now spend on police details
4045859 we feel it is a reneg on the governors promise
4045860 he came into office pledging to put 1 000 police on the street this is going to take 1 000 police off the street we think that public safety will suffer in the long run

4045863 due to the french figures which are very disappointing we now expect a deeper fall for the euro zone as a whole 0 3 percent rather than 0 2 percent
4045864 a technical recession in the euro zone is possible because there is a chance that we will have a slight contraction in the third quarter as well according to leading indicators in the last months
4045865 there is a significant chance of a technical recession in france over the middle two quarters of the year
4045866 the question is when will they cut interest rates but with inflation so high the ecb cannot cut in the coming months we expect a cut only in the third quarter of 2009
4045867 we are reviewing timing of construction and target completion in order to optimise cost and occupational demand
4045868 the dictatorships propaganda lied for 40 years saying that the pazo was paid for by popular subscription as a gift for franco
4045869 but they bought it through extortion by imposing a revolutionary tax on galician citizens
4045870 as much for its uniqueness as for its cultural and symbolic significance the pazo has all the characteristics necessary to obtain the maximum degree of protection

4045911 as long as you are focused and you want to do it you can
4045912 i always get children coming to me saying oh you dance so cool can you teach me i always want to take a mind that is ready to dance i find that the children need to be at least 10 but in my country i can take them from as young as 8 years old because theyve grown up around it and understand the type of dance it is
4045913 there were guys in my home town of debin who practised every day i would sit and watch them and then id go and try it on my own it was a real risk because no one was teaching me or showing me how to do it i did injure myself once i nearly broke my neck
4045914 we burn a lot of fat every day one of my friends when he joined he was fat but after dancing for a bit he quickly went back to his normal body
4045915 you cant do this job and have a big stomach so we eat light meals in the day and after the show have a good cooked meal otherwise where are we going to get the power from
4045916 also i make sure i drink a lot of water and try not to drink too many fizzy drinks
4045917 rest is important too people often dont think about that side of it getting enough sleep is just as important as other parts of our training
4045918 sometimes as a group some of your friends are not that focused they dance and then they leave getting tired of doing the same thing every day
4045919 id known of vukani for a long time through competitions when our dance groups used to battle it out when i moved to johannesburg we decided to work together and form a new thing we wanted to put something together from what we had seen back home using all sorts of movements that were there already
4045920 the dance we were doing before was more like for parties for afrika afrika we wanted to do something more visible on stage for the audience
4045921 this show is only a clip of what we do our full routine lasts 20 minutes using empty crates and cans as well as the brooms we wanted to invent something that doesnt have a limit the dancing is never going to stop
4045922 it is very hard some days to know which way is up

4045932 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
4045933 whats best in me and whats best in my message is consistent with the tradition of hawaii
4045934 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
4045935 and we are aware that the u s is uptight about this project
4045936 but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts
4045937 lets be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that russia and the united states have engaged in on iran or north korea
4045938 if i were a neighbor of russia and i saw what russia had done in georgia i would be very nervous

4046001 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4046002 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4046003 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4046004 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

4046009 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4046010 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4046011 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience
4046012 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4046013 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4046014 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4046015 we know now that the reason people are buying iphones is because they can personalize their experience the expectation was that the app store is what would differentiate the iphone and the numbers seem to bear that out
4046016 i really didnt know that i was going to write something that would be good enough to submit to the app store
4046017 i just thought i would write something i could put on my own phone and maybe put it on a few friends phones i totally did not expect the level of interest that it turns out that there is for doing crosswords on your phone
4046018 basically the first two weeks that the app was in the store i earned more than my entire graduate stipend
4046019 i dont make very much as a graduate student so thats pretty exciting
4046020 now that we have some hard data weve fallen in love with the platform itself
4046021 it hasnt changed our plans away from the consoles but the iphone is definitely part of our road map now
4046022 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4046023 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4046024 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4046025 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4046026 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4046027 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4046028 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4046029 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4046030 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4046031 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4046032 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4046033 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4046034 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4046035 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4046036 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4046037 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4046038 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4046039 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4046040 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4046041 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4046042 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4046043 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4046044 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4046045 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4046046 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4046047 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4046048 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4046049 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4046050 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4046051 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4046052 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4046053 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4046054 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4046055 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4046056 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4046057 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4046058 who are open to doing something on the production side
4046059 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4046060 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4046061 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4046062 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4046063 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4046064 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4046065 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4046066 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4046067 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4046068 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4046069 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4046070 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4046071 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4046072 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4046073 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4046074 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4046075 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4046076 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4046077 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4046078 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4046079 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4046080 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4046081 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4046082 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4046083 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4046084 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4046085 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4046086 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4046087 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4046088 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4046089 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4046090 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4046091 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4046092 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4046093 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4046094 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4046095 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4046096 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4046097 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4046098 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4046099 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4046100 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4046101 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4046102 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4046103 of course its a major loss to the community as well as a financial loss to the airport
4046104 its going to hurt the airport but were not the only ones who are experiencing hard times right now
4046105 they said in the letter that they would be leaving at the end of september
4046106 they havent talked to me directly about what theyre going to do its going to be a big loss for medical transportation times
4046107 they said they are already providing service in wheeling and that they will be in parkersburg soon
4046108 they were here to see our operations and they really seemed interested i feel pretty confident that they were sincere about their interest in the area
4046109 when we had that accident last week on route 52 near bramwell with two fatalities we called in lifeguard 10
4046110 puts us more centrally located to serve all of southern west virginia
4046111 we have made many good friends in mercer county we feel that moving will help us serve mercer county and southern west virginia better
4046112 mercer county airport is located at a lower elevation and tends to stay fogged in more
4046113 lenovo has engineered a new breed of mobile workstation with the thinkpad w700
4046114 no other pc manufacturer has a mobile workstation that delivers the sheer power performance and cutting edge innovation that lenovo has packed into the thinkpad w700 the thinkpad w700 mobile workstation flat out delivers the command performance our customers demand at the desk as well as in the field
4046115 our engineers use lenovo thinkstation workstations to help them design the next generation williams toyota fw31 race cars aiming to make them faster and more agile with greater performance than the competition
4046116 were thrilled to see lenovo deliver the workstation performance weve come to rely on now in a mobile portable solution
4046117 im going to france because we support very strongly the european presidency which is france in its mediation efforts
4046118 i think its best that those mediation efforts now be in the hands of the french
4046119 we have open communication to the russian government and were communicating at very many different levels and through very many different channels
4046120 they recommended for the public safety of the town of cedar bluff that the town of richlands should accept the town of cedar bluffs check for 4 650 40
4046121 and basically that was it they talked about it they discussed that it would still be a part of our system it would still be set off when our system is set off it would still be a part of our system but it would remain in cedar bluff pending further discussion with the town of cedar bluff
4046122 so for example when the central message is sent out from richlands it would activate all three of them when there is a weather hazard or something we will have some live radar feeds richlands will be getting some equipment to make sure the system is much more accurate
4046123 singer in a punk rock band with some decent street cred
4046124 i could fall asleep this way for the rest of my life
4046125 i havent been here very long but ive been very busy so far
4046126 im extremely impressed with the enthusiasm of the employees and the board and the concern and care they have for the betterment of the city
4046127 i was struck by the high quality of professionalism and volunteer service of the people i have worked with over the years
4046128 we feel like we will get a lot of business taken care of and hopefully he will be able to wear more than just an attorney hat as i mentioned last night we intend to get him active in economic development and we intend to have a more aggressive collection on the collection route
4046129 its definitely not on the front page of the sports section
4046130 it was great i was rooting for people that i knew
4046131 he realized that with the smaller field softball is actually much faster than baseball
4046132 everybody practices hard and wants to do their best but sometimes somebody else is a little bit better
4046133 so you go back and practice harder and make yourself better the next time around
4046134 the contenders will be sparring at a level theyre not used to seeing
4046135 ive always said that 10 to 15 swimmers could be on the podium but physically im on top im fitter than i was at the french championships fitter than i was at the european championships
4046136 i really took the 100m freestyle relay to my heart and felt personally responsible but my coach reminded me that a relay has four people so one single person cant carry all the weight that helped me
4046137 bernard is a champion but he has to learn how to deal with defeat and when he has learnt that to spring back that is the sign of a real champion
4046138 i still cant believe it this is a huge victory over myself
4046139 i had to get back into the proper mind set after the 4x100 meters freestyle relay and find again the good sensations that i had in the heats
4046140 i was stressed and experiencing bad sensations after the relay but i managed to recover these good sensations in the heats of the 100m freestyle
4046141 of course we would be concerned about it and we have actually only learned about it actually through media reports
4046142 so all i can say to you is our position is clear and that is that the media must be free to report on the olympic games
4046143 we are in the process of endeavouring to get all the facts and if necessary we will raise our concerns with the appropriate authority
4046144 we had a struggle about two weeks ago when it was apparent that the technology was moving slowly and that there was restriction on certain sites on the internet which as a result of inquiries and clarification were freed up
4046145 and i am in the main press centre every day and i have to tell you that the feedback i get from the media is generally the working conditions are excellent
4046146 thats what we have now done richie and his selectors have done a great job and i told him that when we met up a week ago
4046147 however his term was up so we had to go back to the clubs its now up to them to decide what they want to happen next they are free to nominate anyone they wish including richie
4046148 to the best of my knowledge the intention is to run in the great voltigeur
4046149 as a son of indian ridge he wont mind a bit of cut but he wouldnt want it to get too testing
4046150 police booked his ticket from ho chi minh city to london and i have already paid for the ticket on his behalf
4046151 a search has been initiated for a missing fisherman from the fishing vessel new dawn who was reported overboard
4046152 the missing crew member was wearing oilskins but no lifejacket and entered the water at approximately 10 30pm
4046153 the return to european cup play is important and the boys really wanted this win
4046154 this is an important win but we have to be sure to concentrate for the return game

4046197 i write a rough draft of the whole article on he computer as i write i am constantly changing things so the rough draft has been reworked considerably while being written i usually write about 1 000 to 1 500 words at a sitting and at each sitting i will go back over what i have written up to that point and do some polishing when the rough draft is done i see how long it is and how much cutting i need to do

4046212 as a result of preliminary investigations we have suspended four students and those students will remain suspended until we have further details from the police
4046213 that anyone could come into the school after hours and take advantage of defenceless animals that have been lovingly cared for by our students is disappointing
4046214 there will be consequences for the students according to their level of involvement
4046215 the college has put procedures in place to manage the wellbeing of all students
4046216 we have been reviewing prices daily and despite a steady fall in the kiwi dollar over the last week we have seen enough drop in the price of crude to be able to pass on these savings to kiwi motorists

4046230 what a thrill it is for me and indeed what a great honor that
4046231 sharing this book that means so much to me with readers in the uk has been gratifying to me beyond words to that end i am deeply grateful to reading groups across the uk for embracing the kite runner and for honoring it yet again with this wonderful award i thank you for this award and for your ongoing support and encouragement tashakor a thousand times
4046232 its no real surprise the kite runner is still an absolute bestseller for us and probably will be for years to come this proves that its not just a great book to read but also a fantastic one to talk about and its that word of mouth approval that keeps it in the charts

4046242 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4046243 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond

4046249 im his dad and this aint the way the rules are
4046250 the rules are that children are supposed to bury their daddy
4046251 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent
4046252 i have at all times tried to fair and honest with the students the faculty the staff and the community
4046253 at all times i have done what i have felt was in the best interests of the high school
4046254 dr sullivan will long be remembered in gloucester for the many individual families he helped over the past 10 years i wish him all the best in his retirement
4046255 i think everything just got the best of my head i got nerves on the beam and i carried it to the floor too
4046256 they look pretty young but i don t look 20 so im not one to judge
4046257 its a slap in the face in front of the world
4046258 well i have no proof certainly so much talk about that which possibly could be because one of the girls has a missing tooth if it is true it is totally unfair certain countries go by rules and certain countries do not
4046259 my real age is 16 i dont care about what other people say
4046260 tell me what country in the world has the medals that our lineup has
4046261 youre talking about world champions who have been there and done that
4046262 sie hatten eine gute zeit zusammen aber sie leben im moment in zwei verschiedenen orten
4046263 when i was at the awards ceremony for the 200 fly i started thinking about it and thats when i started tearing up
4046264 to be at the top with so many great athletes who have walked in these olympic games its a pretty amazing feeling
4046265 they were having some keypads issues what the judges push the other was a broadcasters decision it was not nbc the beijing broadcasters were showing the floor live as alicia was ready to compete on beam they couldnt change in the middle of a live event
4046266 the reasons seem logical even though we dont like them
4046267 it was not our decision to hold the competitor from competing
4046268 those are decisions that are made by the fig international gymnastics federation competition official the federations run the competition
4046269 they never should talk to the gymnast and they are obliged to do it right
4046270 we did so much training of making them tough and keeping their focus and concentration and still it happens it is disappointing
4046271 at this point the fig and the international olympic committee have closed the age issue
4046272 its fair to address but at this point the competition was what it was today china was a better team on the competition floor i think theres no making excuses
4046273 hey lindsay was hast du den leuten zu sagen die ber die brust implantate deiner schwester reden

4046280 if you give this place any fewer than five stars youre crazy its hot in nashville and if for 2 50 i can
4046281 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
4046282 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
4046283 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4046284 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
4046285 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
4046286 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
4046287 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
4046288 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
4046289 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning

4046291 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese

4046318 on peacekeeping operations and the situation in the conflict zones of georgia
4046319 for the past several days the situation in the georgian abkhazian and georgian south ossetian conflict zones has intensified the city of tskhinvali has been shelled by the georgian army with victims registered among civilians fighters and unmanned aircraft of the georgian air force have repeatedly violated the conflict territorial air zones in a terrorist attack a south ossetian police officer was killed georgian military set up a post at a strategic site near the village of sarabuki additional military equipment was moved from georgia into the conflict zone without any coordination with the joint peacekeeping forces which was registered by military observers including by the osce mission in georgia these actions point to an open and planned aggression against south ossetia which is the internationally recognized side in settling the conflict
4046320 i consider it immoral for me to remain as a member of shevardnadzes government
4046321 current developments in georgia will turn the country into a criminal enclave in one or two years
4046322 to use force when dealing with any attempt to stage prison riots and to open fire shoot to kill and destroy any criminal who attempts to cause turmoil we will not spare bullets against these people
4046323 now it is time for the government to be afraid of people
4046324 intolerance towards people with different opinions is being planted in georgian politics and in other spheres of social life
4046325 an uncompromising struggle against such negative phenomena as money grabbing bribe taking misappropriation of socialist property private property tendencies theft and other deviations from the norms of communist morality
4046326 it is time to realize that neither socialism nor friendship nor good neighborliness nor respect can be produced by bayonets tanks or blood
4046327 reformers have gone and hidden in the bushes dictatorship is coming

4046369 what then will the owner of the vineyard do to them he will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others

4046397 well be looking at the effects of the earthquake on the ground and for evidence of what actually happened during the earthquake well be looking very closely at how the tectonic blocks actually moved in relation to each other
4046398 much of what actually happens during earthquakes is difficult to view because it occurs deep below the surface by looking at the way in which roads pipelines rivers and other man made markers are affected we can map out how the earth moved what faults were responsible and what kind of activity we might expect in future events
4046399 aftershocks are expected after every large earthquake and this has been no exception earthquakes release stress where they occur but they also cause increased stress in the surrounding rock and this additional pressure has to be released peak aftershock activity is generally in the first few days after the main quake and the number and size of aftershocks decreases rapidly after that
4046400 we are conscious of being as sensitive as possible while working in this area there is still a lot of recovery work going on and there are obvious long term infrastructural problems we hope to be able to visit the town of beichuan which was decimated by the earthquake but this will depend very much on the local authorities were very thankful to the sichuan provincial government for granting us access to the earthquake zone at such a critical time the location of the active faults is crucial we want to see if the faults that weve previously mapped were activated during the earthquake or if the quake occurred along a new set of faults knowing where the active faults lie and how much they are likely to move in future events can help the chinese authorities in planning new buildings and towns to reduce the likelihood of future casualties
4046401 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
4046402 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
4046403 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
4046404 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
4046405 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
4046406 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
4046407 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
4046408 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional memory become unbound during sleep
4046409 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of
4046410 i came to the conclusion that the world is a big place and there is more to life than watching the daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you

4046414 on march 29 he first round of the presidential election which he won you voted for change you have been clear we will not betray you

4046416 mugabe is very experienced in negotiations and if we were to analyse his abilities going back through history to the late 1970s and one thing that mugabe doesnt care about is the timeframe the zimbabwean people continue to suffer but mugabe hangs on doggedly as he has no wish to lose power nor find himself in the hague going with the mdc faction of mutambara will not create a scenario which the international community can buy into
4046417 thats a very thin veneer that everybody can see through
4046418 we are indeed convinced that it is possible to conclude these negotiations quite quickly
4046419 this is a tripartite negotiating framework you cannot get an agreement where only two parties agree
4046420 the leaders of our political parties must rise up to the challenge the main sticking point still remains the balance of executive power the mdc s political rivals the talks broke up on tuesday night without a deal that includes all three participating sides

4046422 zanu pf is not prepared to concede power they would rather divide conquer and rule

4046440 the threat that the u s and israel face from the islamic republic of iran is today greater than ever
4046441 we israel are benefiting from one thing and that is the attack on the twin towers and the pentagon and the american struggle in iraq
4046442 the duty of americans to support an island of democracy in the middle east
4046443 threatens the security of the united states and its allies worldwide thats because jerusalem and israel are ground zero in the global battle between tyranny and democracy radicalism and moderation terrorism and freedom
4046444 the rabbis say in the talmud that a lot of rabbinic law is to put a fence around the torah so you dont get near to violating it well mccain has a series of very clear headed policies toward terrorism and islamic extremism that put extra layers behind his support for israel
4046445 jerusalem is not merely the capital of israel but the spiritual capital of jews and christians everywhere its the site of the first and second temples which housed the holy of holies and its the direction in which we jews face when we pray this glorious city of david is bound to the jewish people by an undeniable 3 000 year historical link

4046447 the crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
4046448 details are still coming in but from the looks of it the pay and arrear hikes are in line with what we were estimating taking into account the pay hikes farm loan waiver and higher subsidies we expect the centres fiscal deficit at 4 3 per cent of gdp versus the governments target of 2 5 per cent of gdp this news does not change our policy call that the rbi is done with hiking repo rates but we still expect another 25 bp crr cash reserve ratio hike before september 2008
4046449 we had looked at on and off budget items to go to 7 per cent including pay commission farm debt waiver and oil package
4046450 given this there will be a wider fiscal gap and we may see it being bridged through small savings the rbi may continue to issue more of 91 day treasury bills to bridge the fiscal gap but additional issuance of dated securities is not clear at this moment
4046451 the wage adjustment is expected in tightening monetary policy in july the rbi has flagged the wage hike as one of the factors justifying a tighter policy stance the fiscal deficit target will be under pressure but i dont expect the outlays to have a significant impact on inflation
4046452 there is no doubt about the fiscal impact on governmet finances and on the deficit the government will have to resort to extra borrowing or undertake stake sales in state run companies otherwise it is very difficult to bridge the gap
4046453 this is just a net addition to the fiscal deficit so one has to see what kind of additional resources the government gets can get
4046454 prima facie this would put an upward pressure on interest rates because it translates into higher borrowing people had sort of factored in a pay commission related transfer so i dont see rates going up sharply
4046455 thats what we have now done richie and his selectors have done a great job and i told him that when we met up a week ago
4046456 however his term was up so we had to go back to the clubs its now up to them to decide what they want to happen next they are free to nominate anyone they wish including richie

4046490 being an engineer you are continuously paying attention to detail to make a track sound better inadvertently this level of attention is transferred onto my own songs
4046491 i was cutting some dubs for cluekid this was when he started putting in a few amen breaks in his tracks like sand snake and round the clock dub
4046492 i suggested making a track with him i wanted to make a track with him because his production was close to jungle in the early 90s this era of jungle played a significant role in my introduction to dance music i was impressed with his ability to recreate this sound and i felt as though his ability mixed with mine could work clue and i have contrasting sounds my sound is very clean smooth and soulful whereas clues can be dark sample based and raw clue was curious in finding out what we could create we arranged some studio time and took it from there
4046493 the main difference in our track is the presence of the kick unlike traditional house the kick drum is not on every beat of the bar 4x4 and its not very loud in the mix in this track the drums have a lot of swing to them hence the term
4046494 at work there are lots of different styles of music i cut there are lots of interesting ideas from different genres and all are inspirational in different ways i enjoy writing music this factor alone can be all the inspiration i need
4046495 sound quality vinyl has four times the resolution of cd
4046496 secondly quality control one of the underlining attributes of a dj is his her selection
4046497 when for example a dj comes down to transition to cut their latest tunes they select the best of their current tracks because cutting dubs can be pricey
4046498 i can only think of one pro for using these digital mediums digital mediums are shock resistant they can be used well in rocky terrain e g a moving boat party playing on a train back of a truck etc this cannot be done with vinyl
4046499 dubstep producers currently pay a lot of attention to sound quality i believe that sound quality can be reduced through the use of digital mediums if sound quality is no longer important the pros of vinyl will no longer outweigh the pros of digital leading to djs using the cheaper option of digital media the second scenario would be if dubstep producers decide to mix in 5 1 surround sound

4046510 milk is one of our highest selling products and as such we have a responsibility to develop alternative packaging making it easier for our customers to go green and to help them recycle at home

4046516 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4046517 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4046518 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4046519 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4046520 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4046521 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4046522 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4046523 were looking to build an online network of field agents wholl write articles and posts that explore a single topic of interest across science and natural and human history

4046526 dua golongan ahli neraka yang belum pernah aku lihat ialah satu golongan memegang cemeti seperti ekor lembu yang digunakan bagi memukul manusia dan satu golongan lagi wanita yang memakai pakaian tetapi telanjang dan meliuk liukkan badan juga kepalanya seperti bonggol unta yang tunduk mereka tidak masuk syurga dan tidak dapat mencium baunya walaupun bau syurga itu dapat dicium daripada jarak yang jauh
4046527 sesiapa yang melabuhkan pakaiannya kerana perasaan sombong allah swt tidak akan memandangnya pada hari kiamat
4046528 sesiapa yang memakai pakaian yang berlebih lebihan maka allah akan memberikan pakaian kehinaan pada hari akhirat nanti
4046529 allah mengutuk wanita yang meniru pakaian dan sikap lelaki dan lelaki yang meniru pakaian dan sikap perempuan
4046530 janganlah kamu memakai sutera sesungguhnya orang yang memakainya di dunia tidak dapat memakainya di akhirat
4046531 wahai nabi katakanlah suruhlah isteri isteri dan anak anak perempuanmu serta perempuan perempuan beriman supaya mereka melabuhkan pakaiannya bagi menutup seluruh tubuhnya semasa mereka keluar cara yang demikian lebih sesuai untuk mereka dikenal sebagai perempuan yang baik baik maka dengan itu mereka tidak diganggu dan ingatlah allah adalah maha pengampun dan maha penyayang
4046532 pakailah pakaian putih kerana ia lebih baik dan kafankan mayat kamu dengannya kain putih
4046533 haram kaum lelaki memakai sutera dan emas dan dihalalkan memakainya kepada wanita
4046534 rasulullah suka sebelah kanan dalam segala keadaan seperti memakai kasut berjalan kaki dan bersuci
4046535 apabila seseorang memakai kasut mulakan dengan sebelah kanan dan apabila menanggalkannya mulakan dengan sebelah kiri supaya yang kanan menjadi yang pertama memakai kasut dan yang terakhir menanggalkannya
4046536 ya allah segala puji bagi mu engkau yang memakainya kepadaku aku memohon kebaikannya dan kebaikan apa apa yang dibuat baginya aku mohon perlindungan kepada mu daripada kejahatannya dan kejahatan apa apa yang diperbuat untuknya demikian itu telah datang daripada rasulullah
4046537 pujian kepada allah yang mengurniakan pakaian ini untuk menutupi auratku dan dapat mengindahkan diri dalam kehidupanku dengan nama allah yang tiada tuhan melainkan dia
4046538 sebagai seorang islam sewajarnya seseorang itu memakai pakaian yang sesuai menurut tuntutan agamanya kerana sesungguhnya pakaian yang sopan dan menutup aurat adalah cermin seorang muslim yang sebenar
4046539 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4046540 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4046541 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4046542 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4046543 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4046544 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4046545 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4046551 jika cinta keduanya tidak berlandaskan ketakwaan kepada allah maka keduanya bisa saling bermusuhan kelak di akhirat apalagi jika cinta keduanya justru menyebabkan terjadinya perbuatan maksiat baik kecil maupun besar tentu kelak mereka berdua akan bertengkar di akhirat seseorang yang sangat mencintai kekasihnya sering melakukan apa saja demi kekasihnya tak peduli pada apa pun juga terkadang juga tidak peduli pada pertimbangan dosa atau tidak dosa jika yang dilakukan adalah dosa tentu akan menyebabkan keduanya akan bermusuhan kelak di akhirat sebab mereka akan berseteru di hadapan pengadilan allah swt inilah yang telah diperingatkan oleh allah swt dalam surat az zuhruf ayat 67 orang orang yang akrab saling kasih mengasihi pada hari itu sebagiannya menjadi musuh bagi sebagian yang lain kecuali orang orang yang bertakwa isteriku aku tak ingin kita yang sekarang ini saling menyayangi dan saling mencintai kelak di akhirat justru menjadi musuh dan seteru aku ingin kelak di akhirat kita tetap menjadi sepasang kekasih yang dimuliakan oleh allah swt aku tak menginginkan yang lain kecuali itu isteriku hidup dan mati sudah ada ajalnya allahlah yang menentukan bukan keluarga noura juga bukan hakim pengadilan itu jika memang kematianku ada di tiang gantungan itu bukan suatu hal yang harus ditakutkan beribu ribu sebab tapi kematian adalah satu yaitu kematian yang membedakan rasanya seseorang mereguk kematian adalah besarnya ridha tuhan kepadanya isteriku aku sangat mencintaimu aku tak ingin kehilangan dirimu di dunia ini dan aku lebih tak ingin kehilangan dirimu di akhirat nanti satu satunya jalan yang harus kita tempuh agar kita tetap bersama dan tidak kehilangan adalah bertakwa dengan sepenuh takwa kepada allah azza wa jalla

4046559 however its obviously a very tight race and in the end it will be votes and not nominations that win this election
4046560 the key debate for those who teach a level students and undergraduates is whether the pressure on teachers and lecturers to spoon feed a level students through exams means students fail to develop the desire to continue learning and the skills to learn independently
4046561 we urge the government to completely rethink the current targets regime as well as the curriculum and the current post 16 exams to make schooling more relevant so students leave school with the skills they need and a hunger to learn

4046569 dont worry about it youre meeting me now besides i have the sense you wanted to talk to me
4046570 i always wondered what would have happened had we met thats what brought me to this place
4046571 just the basics how to spin yarns whether its worth it to lead a life as a teller of tales
4046572 this could be a long night i dont suppose youve any tobacco its a bit hard to come by here
4046573 spinning yarns is easy enough all it takes is imagination youve got that or you wouldnt be here
4046574 of course it is why wouldnt it be what kind of youre serious arent you well hmm i dont know yes no maybe all of the above its as worthwhile as anything else i suppose in the end it comes down to what you want to do and if you can make a living at it i could thats the difference between me and a lot of others even those with talent i got paid
4046575 one of the all time best i often thought that if i could be anyone other than myself id liked to have been you
4046576 thats no good you cant be me you have to be yourself thats all any of us can do no matter where we are tell me do you enjoy your work
4046577 believing wont help youve got to know put it like this would you be happy as an engineer or gasoline boy
4046578 then youve answered your own question it doesnt matter if its a worthwhile life or not youve got it and youre stuck with it good luck
4046579 its not that bad youll get to create your own realities instead of living other peoples once in awhile you might make some money what more do you want
4046580 write about kingdoms to be won a damsel or two to be saved not too many just enough to make things interesting stuff like that always sells have some sword fights throw in some fencing terms and phrases in french thatll make your critics mad
4046581 a little wenching and carousing a bottle of wine now and again a good book of poetry a fight or two all those things would be good for most authors some more so than others makes for interesting reading
4046582 yes im meeting nick hes going to show me his unedited tales that should be worthwhile
4046583 dont let anyone tell you youre not any good none of my fans ever had to apologize whatever you can dream you can live so get out there and live
4046584 i havent signed anything in over 10 years i may be rusty
4046585 results suggest that respondents are confident their organizations will continue to grow but that access to equity funding will impact that rate of growth
4046586 i spent a lot of money on booze birds and fast cars the rest i just squandered
4046587 in grad school any subject is more interesting than the one you profess
4046588 sleeping with a skinny woman is like sleeping with a bag of antlers
4046589 once the condemnation of the majority of the human race to eternal torture is recognized as being an unjust exercise of arbitrary power it begins to be possible to see the god of traditional christianity as being an infinitely terrifying oriental despot ever concerned to manifest and exercise his power by insisting on total obedience and constant worship from his creatures
4046590 both sides agreed to redeploy the troops who are stationed in the pagoda near the temple to the lowest possible number in order to avoid confrontation with each other
4046591 the redeployment of the troops that we have agreed to will finish before the ministerial meeting on august 18
4046592 they were ambushed by insurgents hours before they opened fire on the bus the bodies of five civilians killed in the incident were brought to wanlaweyn
4046593 the driver told us that the ethiopian forces sprayed gunfire on the minibus it was dark and maybe they could not identify whether they were insurgents or civilians
4046594 it was a very important victory mishin is the world champion so beating him is an impressive feat
4046595 he won silver each time and now its time for gold this is his last chance for this medal
4046596 it was so silly i was so close to victory just three seconds until i would advance
4046597 the opponent made me sleepy then made a move im not used to
4046598 i feel no pressure now i will relax and just compete in the evening
4046599 the russians have started to withdraw the georgian police and special forces are taking control
4046600 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4046601 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4046602 we still have diplomatic relations with georgia we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia
4046603 but we wont directly talk to saakashvili we wont do that we offered him peace but not friendship
4046604 its my appeal that we should adopt a reconciliatory approach so that stability should return
4046605 we should all put aside our differences and work to make pakistan strong
4046606 pakistan is passing through a very critical moment in its history and our enemies are trying to weaken us externally and internally
4046607 our democratic coalition government has adopted a policy of reconciliation we should move forward for national progress
4046608 the period of oppression is over forever dictatorship has become a story of the past
4046609 committed to bringing relief to the common man to steer pakistan out of the current political economic situation
4046610 i am pleased to announce on independence day that the impeachment process is moving fast and is on the right track
4046611 the announcement will affect a number of people who have had meetings planned and i know quite a few people who have arranged meetings around the existing timetable
4046612 a months delay is neither here nor there as there are a number of high level issues that need to be resolved it will take quite a long time to resolve these issues even once the fsa has delivered the feedback paper
4046613 many believed that amanda bowes relinquishing her responsibility for the retail distribution review would result in a delay and have an impact on the timing of the next stage of the rdr it is no surprise to us or the rest of the market
4046614 the retail distribution review is one of the most significant projects in the retail agenda and the intention is that it will bring about lasting improvements for consumers and firms in the retail investment market
4046615 rightly jon pain views this important piece of work as one of his key responsibilities and wants to ensure that he is fully involved in shaping its delivery
4046616 hij was n van onze beste presentatoren iedereen in het bedrijf hield van giel en wij zijn natuurlijk erg verdrietig dat dit is gebeurd giel reedt altijd hard en we zeiden er steeds wat van maar het was gewoon het aard van het beestje
4046617 hij was altijd ge nteresseerd in de discussie rond de tafel het was erg fijn om hem als gast te hebben
4046618 giel speelde altijd al met bandjes toen hij een jaar of 8 was maakte hij zijn eigen radio shows voor de hele familie hij praatte de nummers aan elkaar en nam het op met zijn tape recorder die hij voor zijn verjaardag had gekregen
4046619 de isense is geweldig hij werkt net zoals een extra arm het is zo simpel

4046621 it is easy to underestimate the value of work carried out around the home which can easily be taken for granted as an unpaid occupation
4046622 our research identified a significant gap between what people say and what they do when it comes to protecting sensitive information online
4046623 everyone in the credit card industry knew that this day would arrive and expected this serious compromise to have happen before now
4046624 these arrests are a significant development in our fight against the organised criminal gangs responsible for this type of fraud
4046625 to date compromised chip and pin terminals have been found in less than 30 retail outlets throughout the uk together with the banking and retail industries we are working to ensure this figure is minimised
4046626 we are sending a very clear warning to fraudsters these crimes will not be tolerated and that we will continue to target them and disrupt their fraudulent activity
4046627 one way would be to use credit not debit cards as if the card details are compromised the fraudster can only steal the banks money by using a debit card a fraudster can clean out your bank account in a matter of minuets
4046628 it can take anything from 3 to 4 months for a bank to compensate you if your debit card is compromised in the meantime you will have your bills to pay
4046629 hows about this kick off with that joke about the guy who has a big orange for a head and
4046630 then you can round things off with a garfield cartoon or a far side one about dogs and cats
4046631 if mervyn king is determined to publish this god awful stuff every month can he at least get emo phillips to read it out
4046632 if i am going to lose my job and my house and be forced into intravenous drug use id prefer to hear about it in a weird funny up and down voice
4046633 archery would be so much more exciting if they had beer bellied cockneys shouting out the score like in darts
4046634 the archery would be monumentally more interesting and exciting if all the competitors were deposited in a forest and the last three standing could then have a shoot off against each others for the medals remember the olympic motto highest fastest strongest and bloodiest
4046635 i recently moved to the chips and it would appear rain capital of europe brussels
4046636 at my work people are carrying on as if the olympics isnt happening with nary a mention in the first week is this because the belgians are poop at everything or are they going to come into their own in the next few weeks
4046637 remove phelps from the equation and the americans are having a shocker in this olympics so far
4046638 once all the boats and cycles come home over the weekend its not inconceivable that we might catch them
4046639 wouldnt it be an altogether fairer system to organise the medals table by awarding say 3 points for a gold 2 for a silver and 1 for a bronze and then ranking countries according to the total number of points why should a country which has won one solitary gold medal and nothing else be placed above a country which has won for example 10 silver and 10 bronze medals
4046640 today has been a general and memorable discourse about the usefulness of medals table
4046641 so in this theme my suggestion and secret wish for the whole world to really remember these game in the true olympic spirit and not for the number of gold medals is that instead of the usual
4046642 it seems to me that swimming has far too many medals
4046643 if you check out the list of past winners of the 100m 200m and 400m at freestyle medley and butterfly the same names come up again and again solution get rid of the 200m in all events and the individual butterfly completely and since well all have a bit more time on our hands stick back in a non swimming event that we are really good at the 1km cycling then the world well my house will be at peace again
4046644 this morning japanese tv treated us to a look at the office where yesterdays japanese gold medalist ueno san in the 70kg womens judo works
4046645 i notice that the top nations in those games are barely registering on the olympics tally canada amp south africa are noticeably absent so far india is struggling with one gold australia and gb are not doing that spectacularly either is it because the standard in commonwealth sport is so abysmally poor
4046646 so far for me anyway its made like the british olympic team on the gold position on the podium and appeared only the once
4046647 the term the mexican wave has been on this blog a few times instead of just the wave as it is called in canada the us and some other places is there another kind of audience wave
4046648 blimey have they changed the rules i thought they were supposed to shoot at paper targets not at each other
4046649 if coastlines really were an indicator of beach volleyball prowess then greece 13 676km should be comfortably ahead of brazil 7 491km
4046650 canada 202 080km would of course be heading for gold though i guess ambient temperature might be an additional factor
4046651 yes were happy to acknowledge gbs improved showing in the pool just as were happy to acknowledge the wonderful performances of the chinese koreans and japanese swimmers and divers who all sit above or equal to the gb swimming team in the medal tally
4046652 we put chris martin in large pool full of octopuses the idea being to test whether they favoured their right or left feet
4046653 but only two of their eight legs were used for kicking four were used to slap him round the face and the last two to cover their ears
4046654 the good news is they play the bagpipes really well if we can get them to stop mounting them
4046655 if you really want your daughter dead of drugs and the terrorists to destroy our way of life then yes go ahead and buy some cheap shoes off an octopus in a market
4046656 the poor who sell their organs are being exploited whether by richer people within their own countries or by transplant tourists from abroad
4046657 the legacy of transplantation must not be the impoverished victims of organ trafficking and transplant tourism but rather a celebration of the gift of health by one individual to another
4046658 the declaration of istanbul on organ trafficking and transplant tourism
4046659 i think everybody has had an occasion where their physician did a test and they just didnt hear back
4046660 people identify that as a common experience the incident reports we received voluntarily from family physicians and their office staff detail what the problem areas are
4046661 theres a fair amount of risk and harm that results from testing mistakes and slips
4046662 one of the most striking and disturbing findings was that minority patients were nearly three times more likely to experience adverse consequences
4046663 while significant physical harm was rare adverse consequences for patients were common
4046664 this study strongly supports the need for office by office improvements in the overall testing process within primary care
4046665 since many errors are undetected or unreported we can assume this is an extreme lower bound
4046666 and cautions against the over reliance on current technological systems
4046667 we believe that crp plays an important causal role not only in cardiovascular disease but also in renal and inflammatory diseases based on our preclinical data and the safety and pharmacological data we will obtain from this study we plan to create a phase 2 development plan that evaluates several of the most scientifically and commercially attractive indications for isis 353512
4046668 crp is an excellent example of the power of our technology which enables us to efficiently develop drugs to any target and to select targets that provide the most significant therapeutic benefit in disease areas where new treatment options are desperately needed
4046669 immediately we flew in relief supplies red cross disaster experts and the cash needed to help our sister society the peruvian red cross
4046670 but the outpouring of kindness and generosity from donors has allowed us to stay helping those who lost their homes and communities recover beyond the first critical months
4046671 these activities help restore important community and social networks that are often stressed during a disaster
4046672 we even notice the impact among our volunteers now we recognize our stress and lift each others spirits using techniques we learned from the american red cross workers it really helps
4046673 after the staging step oncologists often monitor a patients cancer treatment for effectiveness or reappearance of a tumor
4046674 for many tumors pet scans are only a slightly more effective diagnostic tool in terms of sensitivity and specificity than ct scans or mris
4046675 so their use is being researched to discover if and how much they may improve patient outcomes
4046676 as we age hormone secretion and cell responsiveness decrease possibly due to loss of cell membrane fluidity or alteration of the membrane
4046677 animal studies have shown that omega 3 fatty acids may help hormone signals get into cells whose cell membrane has been stiffened by age
4046678 it is possible to achieve significant changes in the fat molecules in cell membranes after relatively short periods of changes in ones diet
4046679 we wanted to see if we could improve mental function hormone levels at rest and or under stress and immune function toward a pattern more like that of younger individuals
4046680 we concluded that a diet high in omega 3 increases insulin sensitivity and reduces inflammatory markers
4046681 however it did not alter endocrine responsiveness after eight weeks
4046682 clearly a diet rich in omega 3 fats is beneficial to ones heart health
4046683 this study along with similar studies in the future will shed new light and pave the way for preventative measures for heart disease
4046684 she is very beautiful and her accent is wonderful you know you would have a damn fine conversation with her
4046685 a gorgeous girl and we want her to really sex up coronation street since tina obrien left weve been short of a really beautiful young star
4046686 achieving the skin cancer foundation seal for our products is a prestigious and scientifically validating recognition
4046687 the daily moisture charge spf 30 and the face defense spf 15 exemplify our organization wide commitment to skin health we are honored to share this benefit with our customers
4046688 cangen is extremely pleased with the results thus far of this collaboration
4046689 together with our partners at dnp we are poised to introduce the first blood test diagnostic for early stage lung cancer
4046690 as we move forward with this new biotechnology we are excited about the prospect of being able to offer earlier lung cancer detection with greater accuracy
4046691 today marks an important chapter in our companys entrance into the global markets and we are looking forward to commercially launching sf 1019
4046692 malaysia is the first country to grant regulatory marketing treatment and distribution approval of sf 1019
4046693 immunosyn hopes to make malaysia a central distribution hub in order for patients worldwide to be able to receive the benefit of sf 1019
4046694 the healthcare spending of malaysians is incredibly high reflecting the trend of malaysians towards a healthy lifestyle
4046695 this is an exciting early stage development as this puts revenue producing capabilities within short term range for the company
4046696 diabetic foot complications pose a substantial problem in the malaysian diabetic population they are a major source of morbidity a leading cause of hospital bed occupancy and account for substantial health care costs and resources
4046697 the prevalence of foot ulceration in patients attending a diabetic outpatient clinic in malaysia has been reported as 6 foot complications have been found to account for 12 of all diabetic hospital admissions which in turn made up 17 of all hospital admissions at hospital kuala lumpur malaysia
4046698 it can be compared to treating people at the end stage of a medical condition such as after a heart attack or when they have stage iv cancer by then it can be too late
4046699 this represents a new direction in clinical staging and preemptive treatment the goal now is to provide early assessments and monitoring during a decline in function and an upswing in symptoms
4046700 were looking at changes in biological markers using tools like neurocognitive assessment brain mris and electrophysiology to see if we can predict who will become psychotic and who will not
4046701 we study brain changes and genetics we need this information because without it we dont know who to treat because we dont know who will become schizophrenic
4046702 were hoping that if you can improve cognition then you can prevent psychosis
4046703 when a patient is first diagnosed its a traumatizing event for that person and their family
4046704 we couldnt prevent the onset but we know the person has only had one episode and they are early on in the process so now they are at great risk for a relapse or reoccurrence we take the person and the family under our wing
4046705 this study reinforces that by utilizing dicer substrate technology we can knock down the expression of a targeted gene in a way that is highly selective specific and more potent than other rnai approaches furthermore our research suggests that aptamer dsirna delivery systems may offer an important new approach to treating hiv and potentially other infectious diseases in this particular study although the aptamer provided some inhibitory function when tested in this setting alone the dsirna chimeras provided more potent inhibition than the aptamer alone thus suggesting cooperative action between the dsirna and aptamer portions in inhibiting replication and spread of hiv
4046706 the goal of this study was to define modification patterns of 27 mer dsirnas that would be useful for research purposes and would remain active at most sites in different genes regardless of sequence context based on the chemical modifications we explored in this study it appears that the 2ome modification may provide more generalized protection from immune responses than other 2 modifications
4046707 modification patterns of this kind may be useful in therapeutic applications of dicer substrate processed rnai molecules we expect that more extensively modified sequences could be developed for specific sites that would have increased nuclease stability and yet retain high potency which are desirable for pharmaceutical applications such as we are pursuing at dicerna
4046708 dicernas dicer substrate technology offers a new avenue to harness gene silencing and address the entire transcriptome for drug development these studies add to the growing body of data that will allow us to maximize the potential of this technology to develop novel potent and selective drug candidates for important unmet medical needs
4046709 we are very encouraged by the significance of these findings including data in non human primates which continue to validate pcsk9 as an attractive target for a systemic rnai therapeutic approach given its ability to achieve acute and durable reductions in ldl cholesterol
4046710 pcsk9 is well validated based on human genetics but it has been a difficult protein to target using traditional drug discovery modalities such as small molecules and monoclonal antibodies thus rnai affords perhaps the only viable approach for new medicines targeting this key mechanism for control of ldl metabolism
4046711 there is a clear unmet medical need for novel agents that can lower ldl cholesterol and pcsk9 appears to be an excellent genetically validated target for disease intervention
4046712 based on its novel mechanism of action and pre clinical data to date an rnai therapeutic targeting pcsk9 has the potential to rapidly lower ldl cholesterol while possibly functioning synergistically with statins in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia

4046714 the mental health needs of returning servicemembers and their families have been a strong focus of our organization for several years now weve made a point of bringing this issue to our members attention and are committed to helping provide counselors with the resources they need to address this growing challenge weve offered multiple educational sessions on this topic at our conferences over the past several years and also offer ongoing access to publications and continuing education courses on our web site in addition we have advocated for federal laws that will provide military troops with greater access to mental health care
4046715 were pleased to have aca participation in this survey and we applaud the many efforts they have made to focus attention on this issue
4046716 like the aca capella has a strong interest in the issue of military mental health because mental health professionals and military personnel represent two of our largest groups of students we believe a big part of the challenge in meeting servicemembers mental health needs is making sure there are enough qualified professionals to address the need our online counseling and psychology programs including the only online caprep accredited counseling specializations make it more feasible to pursue advanced degrees in the mental health field

4046787 i was very shocked when i realized i was down i just thought i have to go back and try my best there was a very small chance to medal if i did everything perfect but it wasnt meant to be
4046788 i tried to console him and ask what went wrong

4046797 during the bid i was the secretary general of the bidding committee
4046798 i was confronted with many questions about the opening up and reform of china and i did say that the olympic games coming to china will help china to open up further and to reform
4046799 of course there are exceptions like in any other country some people are not satisfied that is true
4046800 i think a few a very few people come here to speak to be critical to dig into the small details
4046801 to find fault that does not mean we are not fulfilling our promise
4046802 the chinese team is responsible for a lot of peoples dreams
4046803 this year has not been very good for china theres been a lot of disasters so these olympic games theres a lot of pressure its impossible not to be nervous and its how to cope with the nerves is our job and right now i feel very excited
4046804 after the athens games i wanted to retire from the national team because i thought i was in very good shape back then if i couldnt win a gold medal then i thought i could never get a gold
4046805 extra training would not have had an effect i was worried that even if i could have adjusted myself to the best standards in 2008 i could not get a gold
4046806 but my coach huang yubin kept on encouraging me he took me on a vacation and told me that the 2008 games would be the greatest chance in 100 years and i should have a try at it he kept pushing me and then he kicked me to the highest position on the podium
4046807 i thought a month ago if i would get this medal i would be every emotional
4046808 but im really not because we won the team gold medal
4046809 he must be the most consistent gymnast and to do it in front of the home crowd with all that pressure thats just a great performance
4046810 actually i did not do any research in regards to the previous medals for france it was not part of my preparations i came to be a part of the final six on pommel horse that was the goal and that was my expectation
4046811 this medal it was so unexpected and i probably will not realize the significance of it until later
4046812 i definitely didnt have that fired up feeling that i had with the team but im really happy with how i did
4046813 i told these two guys when we started camp look one of you is going to make our team and one of you two is going to be our kicker for the entire year and thats what were looking for some stability because we didnt have that last year
4046814 we usually try to keep it on the field and everything
4046815 its tough sometimes you have a bad day and you get frustrated here and there but for the most part its been really good
4046816 once i step on the field and i think hes the same way you want to impress and perform
4046817 but he just doesnt have the personality where it would come to where i wouldnt like the guy we have a past as far as going to the same camps and i know his parents the business side of it of course i want to be the guy here at the end of the day but he is also my friend and i want to see him be successful as well
4046818 another thing that people arent talking about is we talk about it cause thats our job is what do we do if one of these cant make it
4046819 this is all a new experience for me so im just trying to take it all in stride
4046820 i cant really describe the feeling i would get if i won this job
4046821 were being told that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
4046822 we have consistently said that this is an internal matter for the pakistani people
4046823 whoever abrogates the constitution must be punished or we will never stop these dictators usurping power here
4046824 even in my dreams i never said i would have a bronze medal
4046825 my happiness is so tremendous at this time this medal it was so unexpected and i probably will not realize the significance of it until later
4046826 i thought it would be necessary for some of the other gymnasts to make errors
4046827 i came to be a part of the final six on pommel horse that was the goal and that was my expectation and i wanted to just have fun in the all around
4046828 but these are the olympics and anyone can make a mistake maybe then we can deliver a surprise
4046829 the names may change but the results must stay the same
4046830 since the last olympics weve had four more years to build we are ready we are very capable
4046831 i heard she wanted a rematch so i thought id come back and give her one
4046832 i know i can beat the best in the world and now i have the evidence to prove it so im ready to give her that rematch lets do it again yoshida
4046833 im going to close everything out close out the bright lights im not going to look for anyone in the stands
4046834 im going to go on that wrestling mat like i did for trials
4046835 i dont think theyre ready for the level shes bringing
4046836 i dont think honestly theres too many girls right now that when shes wrestling her best bring the game she brings
4046837 i can go back to juniors and beat up on the juniors
4046838 ive got to come together now and show it on the senior level on the big stage
4046839 even in my dreams i never said i would have a bronze medal
4046840 my happiness is so tremendous at this time this medal it was so unexpected and i probably will not realize the significance of it until later
4046841 i thought it would be necessary for some of the other gymnasts to make errors
4046842 i came to be a part of the final six on pommel horse that was the goal and that was my expectation and i wanted to just have fun

4046850 this photo is deeply offensive and racist its surprising that members of an olympic team preparing for the games in beijing of all places would show such poor judgment
4046851 the spanish olympic basketball team owes a full and unconditional apology to their hosts to their fellow spanish citizens and to the people that they have offended and disappointed with this photo
4046852 it is very unfortunate that this happened but i seriously question whether jose or his teammates realized at the time what harm might come of the organizers suggestion
4046853 jose calderon is far too classy to intentionally insult anyone there is no doubt however that better judgment could have been used by everyone
4046854 one of our sponsors asked us to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing so we made an oriental expression with our eyes
4046855 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as somewhat loving
4046856 from here i would like to declare that we have huge respect for the east and their people some of my best friends in toronto are from china anyone who would like to interpret this differently is absolutely confused
4046857 they were trying to be funny it didnt necessarily come across as such and i think they made the appropriate gestures to apologize and as long as they learn from it we can all move forward
4046858 stark saw that it was a red card and theres nothing i can do about it
4046859 its extremely difficult in the third game of your group to get a red card four minutes in
4046860 it makes it hard to play your game and the whole lineup had to be reshaped the whole mentality just went in the trash
4046861 i think stark maybe rushed his decision a little bit in showing the red card but then its behind us of course it changed the game completely but we have to look at the bigger picture
4046862 i had the psychological advantage because my opponent is stronger than me so i have no pressure
4046863 secondly my strategy is quite good i took advantage of my height and kept distance from my opponent
4046864 i thought the scoring was a little bit inconsistent especially in the third round
4046865 its not sour grapes i think billy did lose the bout but what better place for him to get experience for the london games in 2012
4046866 it was a relief because its been a long week and theres a lot of pressure on us

4047041 students cant learn and teachers cant teach in classrooms where kids are disruptive some teachers are afraid to restore order when needed because they fear legal harassment its unacceptable that a teacher would have that hesitation
4047042 ultimately we need parents to recognize that firm school discipline is in every childs interest and support teachers in doing whatever is necessary to maintain it but for now we need action to see that no students education is damaged by the bad behavior of anyone around him
4047043 in schools today teachers are protected from litigation when they hand out medicine but there are no protections for them when they try to prevent disruptive students from disturbing others who are trying to learn

4047052 while the nation faces a crisis in the housing industry my administration is working tirelessly to help kentucky homeowners who are affected by these tough economic times remain in their homes
4047053 with this information we will be able to identify what is causing the foundation of kentuckys housing industry to rot and discover how we can repair the damage before any more kentuckians are hurt we all have to band together to protect our families from the companies that prey on the desperate and unlearned
4047054 by providing these resources the protection center empowers homeowners to learn how to protect themselves and how to work their way out of bad situations

4047059 the reviewers from maine and those from aaas who were from across the country were uniformly impressed with the quality of the applicant pool
4047060 the competitive application process of the fund is extremely important because it encourages collaboration among our universities nonprofit research laboratories and for profit innovative businesses collaboration is proven to bring new technologies from the lab directly to the market such as our composite technology and its application today in our boat building industry
4047061 it is more important than ever that consumers be treated fairly and understand their credit card terms so that they can manage their finances accordingly

4047066 each one percent of improvement would mean over 100 million new dollars to hire more teachers pay them better make class sizes smaller reduce the cost of textbooks and so on thats a huge opportunity and we must seize it
4047067 this is a modest proposal but we want to do whatever we can to support teachers and their commitment to students
4047068 as schools refocus their spending away from overhead and into the classroom we hope eventually to make out of pocket teacher spending unnecessary

4047119 id certainly trust what icc security expert reg dickason says after spending some time with him so ill have to wait and see what he says
4047120 it is obviously tricky because if you are in a position like me having only played a dozen or so internationals you certainly worry about giving your place up and not winning it back
4047121 inside me i think i would not have a problem id trust in them but then your family is saying you must be crackers and your girlfriend is saying i dont want you to go

4047140 artinya sungguh akan datang pada manusia suatu zaman yang pada waktu itu orang tidak memperdulikan lagi harta yang diperolehnya apakah dari jalan halal atau dari jalan haram
4047141 ayat 130 surat ali imran hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu memakan riba secara berlipat ganda untuk mejelaskan bahwa praktik memakan riba secara berlipat ganda itu akan terjadi secara leluasa yakni apabila manusia tidak mempedulikan cara mencari harta serta tidak membedakan antara yang halal dan yang haram
4047142 sesungguhnya islam pertama kali muncul dalam keadaaan asing dan nanti akan kembali asing sebagaimana semula maka berbahagialah orang orang yang asing alghuroba

4047156 we were a very young team and we did not lose our nerve did not panic
4047157 in the end maybe our technical superiority allowed us to score two goals that is a massive advantage for the second leg but we will be on our toes
4047158 they imposed a very physical game on us with man marking all over the pitch they did that with a lot of belief and spirit
4047159 they have given so much in the first half they could not keep the same pace and tightness in their marking
4047160 you saw a performance of great spirit and arsenal were rattled they know they have been in a game
4047161 it just showed our inexperience in europe in key moments and key occasions that we lost this game
4047162 we have a hell of a mountain to climb now but we just need to put in another good performance
4047163 proceed from the assumption that to be respected we have to use brute military force
4047164 its not the best result we had the intention of scoring but it was not to be
4047165 but there are still 90 minutes left the next game will be very different and will be played in different circumstances we will play in front of our fans and in the vicente calderon we are sure that we can get through
4047166 we have to have patience and take advantage of our chances
4047167 in the first leg of the copa del rey with valencia and in the uefa cup tie with bolton we also had a player sent off we have to learn think and be intelligent
4047168 alexander called me on tuesday and told me that magath called him in and told him about celtics interest
4047169 he said celtic wanted him and asked how he might feel about that alexander told him he was open to all possibilities but that scotland would not be his first choice
4047170 other big clubs are also interested but celtic are playing in the champions league the only concern for the player would be the scottish league
4047171 we also have other possibilities but those clubs are still deciding celtic are talking to wolfsburg already
4047172 i can confirm ive had contact from another scottish club who made a bid for the player this week
4047173 the jets game means a lot to me especially after the way last season finished
4047174 that was very disappointing and definitely stupid and id like to just erase all memory of that really
4047175 its been mixed emotions watching the matches ive got my good friends playing at the olympics and im so happy for them to be there representing australia
4047176 but at the same time i know that i should be there with them and i would be if i didnt do what i did in the grand final
4047177 its tough to take but ive only got myself to blame for it all im looking forward to getting past it now
4047178 i train with him every day and weve become very good mates in the few weeks hes been here
4047179 hes always full of advice not only with goalkeeping but just in life in general hes a very smart man and hes passed on a lot of advice to me in the short time hes been with us
4047180 there was a time there where i thought everything was against me
4047181 well have to stay very concentrated there keeping in mind that this team won 5 0 against celtic three years ago
4047182 but were obviously in a good position to go through and in two weeks well be even fitter
4047183 we always bossed the game on the whole it was a good performance
4047184 we played a good game we werent lacking in almost anything
4047185 we created several chances and didnt risk much at the back
4047186 were satisfied but we mustnt think too much about this result we must keep going we need to focus immediately on the return game
4047187 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4047188 lets not talk about that and just hope it continues
4047189 they did have some good at bats made me work and put the bat on the ball
4047190 i was just trying to make pitches when i needed to
4047191 hes one of the best pitchers in the big leagues
4047192 we were behind 4 0 by the second inning both games
4047193 its frustrating to play so poorly today we just didnt do anything good

4047197 the timing has been perfect for ford to do this
4047198 we were probably the first mainstream brand to support him
4047199 we like to think we cemented him as an athlete to watch now everyones talking about michael phelps and what he has achieved in these games
4047200 hes competed against the past hes competed against the history books hes competed against time expectations and everyone who came before him
4047201 michael really embodies what the spirit of this campaign is about
4047202 and because he embodies a lot of the same characteristics of our brand this spot helps in building the visa brand overall
4047203 we had planned if he was successful in breaking the world record to record that ahead
4047204 were continuing to evaluate all opportunities to reinforce our partnership with michael

4047208 for too long wielded a dogmatic veto over any discussion of limiting abortions
4047209 not because of your position on abortion but despite it
4047210 wars of choice capital punishment hunger homelessness health care and refugees
4047211 because they think you not only defend partial birth abortion but also are against lifesaving therapy for newborns surviving an abortion attempt
4047212 can you just simply affirm your conviction that any newborn even after an abortion attempt should be given effective life sustaining treatment
4047213 you may find that the position of most american men and women is quite different from narals
4047214 with your commitment to reasoned evidence based and respectful discourse are you able to challenge your party to welcome pro life catholics into its supposed big tent
4047215 i think since 2004 weve really been talking to the democratic leadership about the importance of trying to expand the big tent of the democratic party
4047216 there will be a place for pro life democrats at the democratic convention as well
4047217 i cant see him getting up there and not talking about being pro life it just wouldnt make much sense for him to speak
4047218 casey symbolizes the pro life cause his name is associated with the issue that would be the whole point of having him speak
4047219 we need to provide more support and options for women to carry to term instead of treating abortion as
4047220 theres absolutely no truth to it whatsoever colin powell will not be at either convention theres absolutely no truth to this

4047227 somos un equipo joven aunque los jugadores supieron mantener la calma y al final aprovechar la te rica superioridad t cnica para hacer dos goles es una importante ventaja para la vuelta pero hay que completar el trabajo en la primera mitad ellos tuvieron buenas ocasiones porque les entregamos el bal n despu s supimos reaccionar y nos llevamos un gran resultado
4047228 creo que debimos haber marcado alg n gol en la primera mitad cuando se tienen ocasiones hay que saber aprovecharlas posteriormente perdimos la concentraci n en dos ocasiones y lo pagamos eso es lo que pasa en europa ante grandes equipos como el arsenal tenemos que aprender de nuestros fallos para ir cogiendo experiencia en todo caso no le puedo achacar nada a mis jugadores

4047304 people in the know know what a dynamic leader he is and what an accomplished governor he was
4047305 most of the country doesnt know exactly who he is and so i think this is an amazing opportunity for him to be introduced to a wider group of people
4047306 in his very person he suggests dynamism an ability to look forward to the future
4047307 for them its kind of doing an obama type thing
4047308 young and interesting and doesnt look like a typical republican
4047309 the keynote is that time when you can really come in in primetime and put your best party face on
4047310 and in general present the personification of the party as it stands today
4047311 to set the tone to in a way capture the spirit and the essential elements of what is going to come out of the convention
4047312 it is in general supposed to be painting the face of the concerns of the party
4047313 and what does it mean to you the people who are watching at home

4047324 half of louisiana is under water and the other half is under indictment
4047325 over the course of many decades louisiana and new orleans have earned a reputation as being exceptionally tolerant of corruption
4047326 this fueled the demise of the local economy as it drove many companies away and kept them away
4047327 the assumption has been that if you want to do business here you need to set aside extra money to grease the wheels
4047328 we have some issues with corruption and bureaucracy but no more than any other urban environment
4047329 we have promised an end to corruption and incompetence in state government make no mistake about it this is a massive first step

4047340 a growing number of countries have expressed interest in nuclear power programs as a means to addressing climate change and energy security concerns
4047341 these countries regard nuclear power as an essential instrument in reducing dependence on fossil fuels and hence greenhouse gas emissions we reiterate that safeguards nuclear safety and nuclear security are fundamental principles for the peaceful use of nuclear energy
4047342 its a fact that nuclear energy today is based on risky reactors leads to proliferation and security hazards and produces long lived deadly nuclear waste with no solution for its safe disposal
4047343 we need solutions based on renewables and energy efficiency to defeat climate change and ensure true energy security

4047404 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
4047405 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
4047406 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems

4047417 if there is one issue that should have been taken to the united nations security council or the international court of justice it is that of missing pakistanis
4047418 some may say that it is irresponsible to make such predictions pending further detailed study to be sure of every point however we will never be certain about every detail and it would be irresponsible to remain silent in the face of what we already know
4047419 lack of political will and the greed of special interests
4047420 simply enforcing the standards of the magnuson stevens act and the us national marine fisheries service would result in major improvements in us waters within a decade

4047456 i end life on the screen by calling into question the notion that we are at the end of the freudian century for me this challenge is deeply felt some say we are moving from a psychoanalytic culture to a computer culture but the reality is more complex the people who do best in this brave new world the people who make the most of their lives on the screen of having multiple identities on the internet are the ones who approach technology in a spirit of profound self reflection
4047457 we had a good first half growing momentum with customers led to revenue growth above the market in all our major geographies

4047467 every u s and french airman who took part in this deployment is better for the experience
4047468 training with the french air force provided us the invaluable opportunity to learn from each others operational experience improve our combat skills and strengthen the bond of friendship between our great air forces and our great countries
4047469 the french visit provided an excellent opportunity to strengthen our social relationship and enhance future relations
4047470 there should be as many combined operations as possible before there are lessons learned in combat
4047471 the cooperation between france and the u s goes all the way back to world war i

4047477 a team comprising of community development workers cdws councillors and mecs visited the different shelters to inform the displaced people about the closure of shelters
4047478 we also used the opportunity to reassure them that as government we are confident that safe conditions exist for foreign nationals to continue living in the province

4047515 the fact is florida is a diverse state that is becoming even more diverse we know that most of these health disparities are prevalent
4047516 but when you look at a poor less educated population the mortality rates are higher
4047517 many of the chronic diseases that we have found in the community can be prevented or controlled with more health education
4047518 we have to start giving people the tools and we havent been doing it
4047519 je nai pas fait ce film juste pour changer de genre jai tout simplement t captiv fascin par cette histoire comme vous je lesp re je ne m tais dailleurs m me pas rendu compte que je navais jamais rien fait dans ce style jai trouv que cette histoire tait presque impossible raconter et je me suis vraiment impliqu dans ce projet pour cela
4047520 vous savez plus je vieillis plus je suis conscient de ce qui me ressemble je me connais de mieux en mieux dans ce film il y a des pisodes proches de ceux que jai v cu moi m me ainsi que toute l quipe car nous venons tous de foyers clat s
4047521 le film est tr s proche de la r alit il ny a que quelques changements mineurs notamment par rapport mes parents ou au personnage de brenda lorsque jai vu pour la premi re fois c tait compl tement surr aliste javais vraiment limpression de replongez dans ma vie plusieurs dizaines dann es en arri re ca fait un dr le deffet
4047522 je nai pas voulu faire un r le plus l ger ce qui mint ressait surtout dans ce personnage et dans ce film c tait toute la dynamique familiale il y a des choses qui mont profond ment touch dans les th mes d et bien sur j tais incroyablement attir par le personnage de frank abagnale qui parait totalement surr aliste c tait tellement incroyable de penser tout ce que cet homme avait r ussi faire dans les ann es 60 quand je choisi un r le je le choisi par instinct
4047523 je pense aussi que chaque r le est exigeant et demande une concentration propre et une motivation r elle
4047524 jaime travailler avec de bons acteurs peu importe quils soient des supers stars ou pas
4047525 je pense qu 16 ans on a des r ves plein la t te pour moi c tait de faire quelque chose qui me passionne et darriver le faire bien je r alise donc mon r ve avec ce m tier
4047526 mes r ves sont devenus r alit s puisque je voulais faire des films a a toujours t mon but dailleurs 12 ans je faisais d j des films en 8mm alors que j tais boy scout
4047527 quand javais 16 ans je r vais d tre soit agent de voyage soit biologiste soit acteur mais je ne pensais pas que lon puisse r ellement tre un acteur professionnel finalement je ne suis pas agent de voyage mais jai un m tier qui me permet de voyager
4047528 moi aussi figurez vous que je voulais tre agent de voyage h las le r ve ne sest pas r alis et finalement je me retrouve acteur et je vais avec mes talents de nations en nations de pays en pays rires
4047529 je ne ressemble pas vraiment frank je nai ni son courage ni son culot je lai rencontr pendant deux jours avant le tournage et je trouve que cest vraiment un acteur tr s accompli il sait mettre le bon costume prendre laccent quil faut et utilise tr s bien son instinct pour manipuler les gens
4047530 quand truffaut est revenu de son tournage avec spielberg il nous en a en effet beaucoup parl il avait ador travailler avec lui en dehors du fait quil ait pass beaucoup attendre car c tait un tournage tr s long d aux nombreux effets sp ciaux du coup je mattendais avoir un tournage interminable mais finalement ce fut le film le plus rapide tourner que je nai jamais fait
4047531 spielberg est un cin aste incroyablement disponible il prend en compte tout ce quon lui sugg re sur un plateau et quand il est content dune proposition ou dune sc ne il saute en lair et vous prend dans ses bras ce nest pas du tout le genre de r alisateur tre carr et rigide
4047532 je crois en la collaboration sur un tournage car on ne peut pas tre cin aste et inflexible un peintre peut l tre mais pas un r alisateur sur par exemple jai beaucoup travaill avec leo avant le tournage on sest vu une fois par semaine pendant quatre mois

4047547 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4047548 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4047549 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4047550 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4047551 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4047552 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4047553 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4047554 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4047555 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4047556 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4047557 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4047558 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4047559 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4047560 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4047561 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4047562 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4047563 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4047564 buy according to little something dr seuss they simply need an one word to give those one thing step 1 never ask a yes or no question q do you think the first meeting with a prospective client should be a bombard one before and after reaching for the telephone to make a prospecting call
4047565 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4047566 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4047567 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4047568 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4047569 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4047570 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4047571 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4047572 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4047573 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4047574 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4047575 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4047576 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4047577 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4047578 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4047579 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4047580 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4047581 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4047582 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4047583 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4047584 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4047585 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4047586 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4047587 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4047588 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4047589 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4047590 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4047591 the key linguistic debate has been whether to reduce the number of abortions or reduce the need for abortions

4047595 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4047596 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

4047598 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4047599 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4047600 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4047601 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4047602 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

4047606 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4047607 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4047608 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4047609 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4047610 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4047611 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4047612 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4047613 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4047614 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4047615 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4047616 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4047617 alles in allem sind die zahlen trotz der probleme im trading segment immer noch recht gut ausgefallen

4047636 we have to do everything so people understand that this is a real campaign and not just a conceptual art piece

4047641 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4047642 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4047643 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4047644 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4047645 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales

4047647 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4047648 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4047649 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4047650 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4047651 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4047652 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4047653 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4047654 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4047655 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4047656 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4047657 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

4047701 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4047702 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4047703 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4047704 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4047705 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4047706 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4047707 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4047708 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4047709 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4047710 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4047711 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4047712 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4047713 an enchanting story of faith and family that is as enlightening as it is encouraging

4047757 this is the first year that we did the patient safety and satisfaction analysis
4047758 the major finding was that hospitals that invest in it also have higher patient satisfaction levels
4047759 the thing that we have to be careful about though is that association is not causality we dont know that it caused the higher patient satisfaction it may be that hospitals that are good at hospital improvement are good at a lot of things
4047760 you get the sense that organizations that take a holistic approach are successful
4047761 the patient safety analysis combined with the five year analysis of quality continues to build the case for the appropriate use of it as part of the quality and customer service success of organizations
4047762 well continue to do the survey because its truly the only national inventory of what hospitals are using and how theyre using it it provides a benchmark group on the successful use of it so it serves as a resource for every hospital to see an in depth analysis of their hospital compared to others
4047763 plus were keeping the importance of it front and center for the entire health care executive team

4047767 we do have credible reports that russia has taken actions that violate the cease fire agreement and thats what the president was referring to
4047768 i cant get into specifics but we do have those reports and were concerned about them and we are working to get concrete information its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
4047769 it is very difficult to get accurate in real time in a crisis that is fast moving
4047770 this is a motorized conflict in a relatively small area and that means the situation on the ground can change very quickly
4047771 i think this is a significant lack of policy and analysis
4047772 i think the administration has most of what they need
4047773 im sure we have a lot more information than theyre discussing publicly
4047774 weve started conversations about it and i think in the next 30 or 60 days well be able to talk completely about that
4047775 i think that john kerry is going to win the election the senator from massachusetts is going to be president of the united states and he is doing exactly what he should be doing

4047800 if we want to give our kids all the opportunities they need to experience amateur sports so that we can have a flourishing sports culture so that we can achieve nationally and internationally then we need to make an investment
4047801 and by hosting the pan am games it allows us to make that kind of investment
4047802 first of all i want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the two individuals who lost their lives
4047803 whats important for us to do right now is to allow the investigation to take place lets await the outcome of those investigations and then lets draw what lessons we might from that terrible experience and see what changes if any we need to make to ensure it doesnt happen again
4047804 something that we often lose sight of is that canada has a very strong brand in the international community so ive discovered that there is a lot of support for us

4047825 mahatma gandhi was also a husband father a family man though his sacrifices have been chronicled on screen before we would also like to highlight the sacrifices made by his family a story largely untold we would also be shooting on the actual location to give authenticity it deserves
4047826 we were very lucky not to concede a goal we did not play well and the performance was poor but the result was good
4047827 playing the second leg at anfield has to be a massive difference sometimes you dont have to say too much to the players because everyone knows it was a very bad performance
4047828 it was a bit of a surprise how we played because we had been doing well in pre season and had a lot of confidence the only positive is that we did not concede
4047829 liege were very aggressive and we could not keep the ball or pass our control was bad and we did not play well except pepe he was my man of the match pepe is very good at penalties and that is really important you always have confidence over penalties with him in goal
4047830 we will have to win at anfield but well have more people available we have a lot of players away or injured and the competition for places needs to improve
4047831 gerrard couldnt start and he is a player who can change a game and if you have two or three players of this level on the pitch it is different
4047832 i have been really pleased with the commitment of the players in pre season but this game was different it was difficult and we didnt play well
4047833 fabio aurelio and skrtel have been training and when they are available we will have more options argentina play holland in the olympics too so one player will return earlier if you have more players competing for places it is better for the team
4047834 i would put chelsea manchester united and liverpool as favourites again to win the premier league but regarding arsenal they also have a great team but im not sure if the group has enough experience and quality to win
4047835 i see nobody else to win the premier league but tottenham surely have the quality to fight for a top four finish i cannot really say who the surprise team will be but year after year we always wait for a better newcastle they are a top club they have huge support and they have good players so we wait for more from them
4047836 gareth bale has signed a new contract that will see him commit his future to the club until 2012
4047837 the only thing i can say is that hes a winner and hes a person who tries to make sure that all the players feel comfortable around him said melchiot i think those are probably two of the biggest parts of him no matter what happens he always wants to win
4047838 when steve bruce came everybody started looking at different things and he shook the team up and put the discipline right some of the guys probably had the situation where they maybe had the sun above their head he took the sun away and made sure that everybody worked a bit harder
4047839 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
4047840 political stability in my view can only be brought through a reconciliation approach as opposed to confrontation
4047841 the era of repression is over forever dictatorship has become a tale of the past
4047842 we were a very young team and we did not panic did not lose our nerve
4047843 in the end maybe our technical superiority allowed us to score two goals that will be a massive advantage going into the second leg but we will be on our toes
4047844 they imposed a very physical game on us with man marking all over the pitch they did that with a lot of spirit and belief they had given so much in the first half they could not keep the same pace and tightness in their marking from then on we looked comfortable
4047845 we needed to be patient and not make mistakes at the back we were so young in the middle of the park for a game of that level and you could be worried but i had confidence in them
4047846 you saw a performance of great spirit and arsenal were rattled they know they have been in a game
4047847 we are so disappointed but proud of the performance it just showed our inexperience in europe in key moments and key occasions and thats why we lost this game
4047848 we have a mountain to climb now but we just need to put in another performance this team will learn a lot and be better for it

4047945 crisis has dealt a setback to us efforts to draw georgia and other former soviet states into the western sphere of influence and plunged an already fraught us russian relationship into deeper disarray

4047951 appears to have all but given up his bid to reclaim two disputed regions on the russian border
4047952 with scant leverage in the face of an emboldened moscow
4047953 is expected to cancel an upcoming naval exercise with russian navy vessels and to press nato likewise to prohibit a russian warship from joining a separate alliance exercise
4047954 warned that russia risks international isolation if it persists with the fighting
4047955 mulling responses to russias attacks on georgia that range from cancelling multilateral naval exercises to reconsidering moscows place in global bodies
4047956 this isnt 1968 the predecessor state of russia the soviet union didnt care about its international reputation because it wasnt attempting to integrate into international organizations it wasnt attempting to be a part of the prosperous and forward looking europe the russians have said that they do want to be a part of that prosperous and forward looking international community and frankly theyre doing great damage to their ability to do that
4047957 suggested yesterday that an apparent cease fire in georgia came about because moscow feared it would be banished from western dominated international economic and political institutions if it did not stop its aggression in the former soviet republic
4047958 one month ago secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in tbilisi georgia for a high profile visit that was planned to accomplish two very different goals
4047959 she warned saakashvili not to get into a military conflict with russia that georgia could not win
4047960 rice struck a different tone one of defiant support for georgia in the face of russian pressure
4047961 exploited recent political turmoil in pakistan to strengthen its foothold along the countrys border with afghanistan a top us counterterrorism official said yesterday in an assessment that also warned of a heightened risk of attack during the upcoming us election season
4047962 the loss of key leaders to us strikes osama bin laden continues to enjoy a haven in the border region and has managed to deepen alliances with a wide range of islamist groups from south asia to the middle east
4047963 said much of al qaedas resurgence was made possible by a disastrous cease fire that mr musharraf brokered with tribal leaders in september 2006 yet the grim intelligence assessment mr gistaro presented on tuesday indicated that american spy agencies believed that the qaeda threat metastasized long after that cease fire ended
4047964 went further than director of national intelligence michael mcconnell in describing recruitment of operatives to attack the west
4047965 said gistaros unclassified remarks were based on existing intelligence estimates and open source reporting
4047966 have devoted nearly half their airtime to defending the groups legitimacy this defensive tone continues a trend observed since at least last summer and reflects concern over allegations by militant leaders and religious scholars that al qaeda and its affiliates have violated the islamic laws of war particularly in iraq and north africa
4047967 tortura cerca de la villa ol mpica gu a a los campos de trabajo forzado de china
4047968 cualquier periodista que viaje a china necesita tener acceso a toda la verdad de lo contrario se van a ir con solo la mitad de la historia

4047974 algunos observadores extranjeros estimaron que los adherentes a falun gong constituyen al menos la mitad de los 250 000 prisioneros registrados
4047975 desde la aparici n en 1999 de los primeros alegatos de estremecedores m todos de tortura y muertes en custodia hasta la evidencia m s reciente de sustracci n de rganos de prisioneros de conciencia los miembros de cipfg han solicitado repetidamente permiso para ingresar a china e investigar las acusaciones de abusos
4047976 sin embargo en todas esas ocasiones estas solicitudes fueron denegadas y esa es en parte la importancia de esta gu a ya que provee informaci n a periodistas que viajen a china para que aprovechen esta escasa oportunidad de acceder a un pa s para realizar una investigaci n independiente

4047983 against georgias internet infrastructure began as early as july 20 with coordinated barrages of millions of requests known as distributed denial of service or d d o s attacks that overloaded and effectively shut down georgian servers
4047984 as it turns out the july attack may have been a dress rehearsal for an all out cyberwar once the shooting started between georgia and russia according to internet technical experts it was the first time a known cyberattack had coincided with a shooting war

4048001 usually anywhere from 30 to 60 per cent of the amount paid for real estate deals in our country is in the form of black money
4048002 a significant portion of this could be in fake currency
4048003 easy availability of fake currency and the huge black money we have
4048004 unless that happens it is very easy for an individual to pump a few lakh rupees into the official economy every few days
4048005 random checks across india in currency chests and bank branches should be the first step
4048006 then wherever we find a significant presence of fake currency we have to carry out intensive combing

4048015 he confirmed this in writing to the swimming federation weve also spoken with the national olympic committee and they have underlined to us that all their athletes compete here in the right spirit against athletes from any nationality
4048016 we take both the athlete and the national olympic committee at their word on this
4048017 its not the first time and unfortunately it probably wont be the last time either
4048018 we are very sorry that the athletes are involving politics in sports i think the water in the pool and the water in the sea are just water and they are for sport not for politics we dont have anything against iranians just the extreme iranian regime

4048021 ok show us this stinking pile of shit now so we can get it over with and go back to hating george lucas
4048022 reserve days will be used to try to complete the scheduled races in the opening series
4048023 this is a matter of establishing personal relationships of planting our flag and make it known to everybody that we are serious and determined
4048024 the fact that we recently received the support of the federal government was absolutely critical and vital to making sure this is well received
4048025 if we want to give our kids all the opportunities they need to experience amateur sports so that we can have a flourishing sports culture so that we can achieve nationally and internationally then we need to make an investment
4048026 and by hosting the pan am games it allows us to make that kind of investment
4048027 first of all i want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the two individuals who lost their lives
4048028 whats important for us to do right now is to allow the investigation to take place lets await the outcome of those investigations and then lets draw what lessons we might from that terrible experience and see what changes if any we need to make to ensure it doesnt happen again
4048029 something that we often lose sight of is that canada has a very strong brand in the international community so ive discovered that there is a lot of support for us
4048030 theres more work to be done obviously were going to have make a formal presentation in acapulco in some point in time but there is a warm receptivity shall i say for toronto and region hosting the 2015 pan am games
4048031 we all have success only when we realize our own dreams
4048032 will something be done ahead of the second leg certainly yes but before saturday no
4048033 if you look at the number of players we had out you can say it was very positive for us
4048034 es ist nicht sicher dass die kftc einer m glichen transaktion zustimmt auch ein vertragsabschluss ist noch nicht sicher
4048035 i was adopted too i cant give you any information about your birth parents but i can give you the url to a website that helped me out a lot
4048036 there is no doubt that the situation in the air travel industry is serious and probably the most difficult it has ever been
4048037 the cats of new zealand will just have to be judged by someone else
4048038 i never got an allowance any money i wanted i had to work for
4048039 the players will just have to accept what happened here and we mustnt lose sight of our future objectives the next step for them is the full national team and theres no doubt in my mind that weve gained an awful lot in terms of experience in this tournament
4048040 we know we didnt come away with the results wed hoped for and youre always going to get criticised when you lose but this is only our second appearance at the olympic games and we were in a very tough section a lot of sides are used to competing at this level but its tougher for us and even though no one wanted this to happen its not really a surprise
4048041 we werent overawed and we suffered two honourable defeats you also have to remember that italy are one of the strongest teams in the world and while our finishing wasnt good enough it has to be said we didnt have the best preparation some of our best players only joined up with the squad at the last minute and we paid for that
4048042 before the last game we spoke to the boys about the importance of being here unfortunately we didnt get the result we wanted but experiences like this will stand us in very good stead for whats lies ahead theyll really benefit from it
4048043 its a shame we couldnt bring some joy to the honduran people but you have to understand that we can learn a lot from this for the future
4048044 im getting on so for me playing in the olympics is just something i can be proud of for them though its another benchmark in their personal development and theyll get the benefit of it in the future
4048045 i see the sword of damocles is right above your head
4048046 ik ben goth ik ben punk ik ben een technohead
4048047 the relief and rehabilitation process might take longer than the security operations
4048048 our army engineers are ready to help in the rehabilitation efforts including in rebuilding hundreds of houses destroyed and damaged during the conflict
4048049 the next task would be to help civilian agencies in handling the displaced people
4048050 the security situation has improved but it will probably take a bit of time before people feel secure enough to return home en masse
4048051 we have to be looking ahead to people having to potentially rebuild their lives a lot of houses villages have been destroyed
4048052 some of them need a little counselling most do not a lot of them are used to it its not the first time that this has happened
4048053 its a very murky underground that most people dont know exists
4048054 as soon as we start doing this i guarantee well find less of them because theyre going to get smart and change the way they do business
4048055 then well be back to tracking them down and putting it all together like a puzzle and thats when it gets real messy
4048056 they shut down at one location move across the street to another change the name and its basically the same individuals
4048057 this underscores the difference between responsible operators which are our core members and the unlawful rogues who imperil public safety
4048058 i would like to think if somebody saw that bus and knew there was an out of service order for angel tours they would have connected the dots and said hey we think weve got a problem here and looked at it
4048059 there is a deficiency in budget and manpower within the fmcsa as there is with a lot of government agencies and there are just so many companies out there

4048075 the recommendations in our report are aimed at benefiting both landlords and tenants by enabling them to use existing legal processes more productively thereby more fully realising the intended impact of housing legislation
4048076 implementation of these reforms would not only improve rental conditions for tenants but also help to build the reputation and professionalism of landlords
4048077 more broadly it would encourage institutional investment in the provision of rental accommodation enhancing the important role of this sector in the wider economy

4048081 we have today agreed that we will initiate 80 million of water buyback earmarked for south australia
4048082 we will also now conduct a queensland water tender from those who hold water entitlements in queensland
4048083 extending the existing commitment of 34 million to 40 million
4048084 that is 400 million allocated now for the purchase back of water entitlements in the northern basin from queensland and nsw down to the menindee lakes
4048085 theres been some challenge to the accuracy of the murray darling commission numbers
4048086 we will commission one of the independent accounting houses of the world to separately and independently audit the accuracy of the murray darling basin commissions numbers
4048087 in other words where you have defined and discrete irrigation communities the commonwealth is prepared to step in and buy back the entitlements from that entire community
4048088 finally cabinet agreed to work with state government to co fund the purchase of appropriately located irrigation properties and their water entitlements to enhance environmental outcomes across the northern basin
4048089 these are practical measures which are part of a long term plant to deal with a highly stressed water system and climate change

4048095 only yesterday the firm cairn formally informed us thatgas reserves at sangu are being exhausted fast and the fieldmay not be able to produce any gas after the end of next year
4048096 we have been frustrated by this information but will sitwith cairn next week to try to sort out the problem
4048097 it will be possible to increase production to supply upto two years if we are allowed to invest 10 million more forwell intervention and installation of gas compressors atdifferent wells
4048098 you filed on july 21 before the office of presiding justice conrado vazquez a pleading denominated as interpleader what rules are governed by this interpleader petition
4048099 if the presiding justice is not a court then why did you file the petition
4048100 ah so now its not a letter anymore but a memorandum which is it you said you memorized the irca internal rules of the court of appeals and yet you dont know the rules of court
4048101 we are not talking about the substance it was made to appear that there was a transcript made on the deliberation when it fact it was drawn from his memory
4048102 you say you prepared it out of memory you must have a very photographic memory because page three of the transcript has 225 words i counted it page four has 454 words fantastic memory
4048103 i told her that i will get it back which i did get it back she was with me in the decision beforehand shes a very nice lady before
4048104 why are you stressing that she is a nice lady before or after or whatever
4048105 she simply asked can i read it to me it was a very harmless request
4048106 when i gave her vidal the copy there was no rollo involved and no official receipt meaning it was unofficial
4048107 she being a nice lady you cannot refuse her but you told her to sign it
4048108 i only gave her vidal an hour or two to read the decision and i had to get it back immediately
4048109 you are under oath there was no request never never did i request you to allow me to have a peek at your decision it has all the earmarks of a final decision you carry it in an expensive looking bag it also has the earmarks of a final decision as a matter of fact there are three copies of the decision and there is also a certification that i concur in that decision
4048110 your series of lies only pinpoint to your lack of credibility
4048111 looking worried and asked if i signed it the document
4048112 after the close of officer hour he came back looking worried and asked me if i signed it i said yes and he left at once but with instruction that he will pick it up the next day now i have a reason to believe that that is a final decision and he is just weaving his lies in order to cover up and escape
4048113 people were passing out and getting physically ill we decided to end it before we risked turning into a horrible new story about how video games ruin peoples lives none of us doubt that pandemonium warden can be killed we just call into question exactly what the development team thinks is reasonable from human beings

4048119 the developers have really taken care to provide extensive depth and content which could make this game one of those that stays on gamers hard drives for a long time
4048120 in elven legacy weve focused greatly on making the plot intriguing and nonlinear our games are already known for their rich tactical opportunities which usually come highly rated by players this combined with our improvements in the ai and interface allows for this game to appeal both to fans of turn based strategies and to newcomers to the genre

4048123 i write to place on record the appreciation of the peoples progressive party to gen aronda nyakairima the chief of defence forces and the updf for the contribution you have made to the rooting of multiparty democracy in uganda
4048124 i am referring to your recent address to the students of makerere university in which you assured the people of uganda of the position of updf on the future multiparty elections come 2011 and beyond
4048125 we have also written back to him and talks are still going on
4048126 he has not fulfiled the conditions he has never completed the payment of sh3b we are seeking your intervention
4048127 the title was given to him by the uganda lands commission the issue is very controversial
4048128 the matter is taking long this is government land and should be protected
4048129 what do i do if they cant call for a meeting to sort out the issue they keep writing to us and we write back but we dont hold any meetings
4048130 we thought gacaca would bring the problem and its seriousness to the community
4048131 our system can be better adopted by an african country
4048132 it was something we thought we would not have achieved in a short time because the population was divided along ethnic lines but over eight years rwandans are speaking with one voice
4048133 we are willing to engage in discussions with unionbancals special committee which has been our policy all along and there is no change to that
4048134 is seen as an attempt to raise the price of the tender offer
4048135 we are fully ready for the ceremony our men have been deployed to the area i will advise the militants to stay off the ceremony in their own interest
4048136 you know that we have a joint committee that has been working on it and it will be like overflogging the issue
4048137 as i said in some of the interviews the issue of bakassi is a very delicate issue we must handle it with a lot of caution i listened to a professor of law analyzing the thing and i cannot but agree with him
4048138 we have to choose between being a bad boy of the international community by reneging on the handover i believe that there are a whole lot of things the government can do it can still even by being seen to be abiding by the law enter into some form of negotiation
4048139 because we have already been assured contrary to speculations that that part of bakassi is not really very heavily laden with mineral deposits as alleged
4048140 what actually are the issues is number one the welfare of our people in that place whether government has done enough to rehabilitate the people and cushion their sufferings
4048141 the item that consummated the agreement spelt out that on account should the cameroon constitute an impediment to nigerian military forces having access or exit from the bakassi into nigerian waters
4048142 that has been the major security issue that was raised and that has been addressed in the green tree agreement
4048143 one other point that people have spoken about is the treaty and the domestication processes like this are not things you can complete in a jiffy
4048144 when you hand over you have to take care of creating or renaming the bakassi local government as enshrined in the third schedule of the constitution and initiate the process of domesticating the treaty because actually the government could have gone ahead to implement the icj judgement without treaty but since the green tree agreement has been brought in that treaty aspect is to be handled by the national assembly
4048145 i believe that this hand over can never be said to have been completed until all these processes have been completed without the amendment of the constitution i believe the president is a man that is committed to the rule of law he has a judgement on his laps
4048146 nigeria is a signatory to the icj nigeria is a responsible member of the international community nigeria is an aspiring member of security council so we have to put all these into a basket we have boxed ourselves into a tight corner
4048147 what the president is doing is being careful by making sure that we dont jeopardize the overall international interest and obligations of nigeria on account of this unfortunate but avoidable mess in bakassi but we have already found ourselves there nigeria initiated the legal action
4048148 we took the matter to the icj if we did not believe in the authority of icj we should not have gone to court in the first place another view is that having gone to court and seen the way it was going we should have pulled out but we did not do that
4048149 we stayed there and the judgement landed on our lap and we woke up and this is a delicate matter and nigeria should see it as such
4048150 there is nobody who is happy that any territory of nigeria is going away i know that even when southern cameroon left there was a hoopla in the country
4048151 so i believe we have watched what is happening between georgia and russia and i believe that having gone through a bitter experience of war in the country no nation wants to avoid war at all cost but every nation wants to be sure that you fight only wars that are necessary
4048152 i am not happy that we are losing bakassi and other villages and towns in borno state its only natural but then what do we do
4048153 we went to court to the level of international court of justice and then we lost the case
4048154 to be fair to this government what can it do can this government abrogate that agreement remember it is a country that went to the international court of justice and we lost that case what do you expect nigeria to do
4048155 our history and the israeli history are different the environment that the israelis and palestinians are living in and the nigerians and cameroons is completely different so dont compare us with the israelis
4048156 when you say that you only lose a territory through war that is a completely wrong and myopic thinking
4048157 let us face it let us be sympathetic with this government this government met something on ground it has to conclude and you know government is a continuous thing i do not expect this government to say that they wont go through with this green tree agreement government does not operate that way
4048158 i dont think that court has jurisdiction to make that statement look i dont know which court is higher but common sense will show that international court of justice is higher than this court which gave the injunction
4048159 i think nigerians are very nice people they are the nicest people on earth they are very forgiving i think they should be able to forgive all the mistakes that the previous government has made so that we can move on the people of bakassi the people of cameroon remember we are all the same people but for the treachery of the berlin conference but whatever happens we all have to move forward

4048205 the house of representatives had passed the same figures however a seven man committee was set up by the senate to harmonize differences in the allocation to ministries and parastatals

4048207 today we have to bring up the numbers of our members of the constitution review committee to 44
4048208 so we now have 44 members because there was need to take care of some special interests and then of course as the senate president explained the deputy senate president was mistakenly taken as a nominee for enugu state
4048209 that was not the practice in the past the practice has always been that the chairman is a nominee of either the senate or the house of representatives which has also been corrected in the lower chamber
4048210 and that is why enugu state has now been given an opportunity to bring its own nominee so the enugu nominee came on board and six additional nominees to take care of special interest bringing them to 44 instead of 37
4048211 take off now will depend on the chairman because the house has 41 so we are expecting that the house will also beef up their own to 44

4048221 american airlines procedure allows for an evacuation when there is smoke in the cabin of an aircraft
4048222 those procedures also allow for flight attendants to initiate an evacuation the flight attendants acted appropriately to evacuate flight 31 and in fact the evacuation was accomplished quickly exactly according to procedure and with only very minor injuries which are common in slide evacuations

4048225 preliminary air traffic control atc information provided by the federal aviation administration faa revealed the airplane was at 9 200 feet heading southeast at 1448 when the pilot reported that he was encountering severe turbulence and intended to reverse direction to divert around the weather
4048226 radar data indicated the airplane continued on its southeasterly heading for about another minute and then made an approximate 270 degree left turn to a westerly heading the airplane continued for about three more minutes until the last radar hit was observed at 1453 in the vicinity of the accident site

4048229 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
4048230 the previous policy allowed active military personnel traveling on duty to travel with up to 190 pounds of luggage at no charge including a 100 pound checked bag a 50 pound checked bag and a 40 pound carry on bag
4048231 only one other airline waives first and second bag fees for off duty active service members and no airline allows as much free baggage by weight as american airlines
4048232 we always understood that soldiers traveling on duty were reimbursed by the military for the fees on required excess baggage however after recently hearing of the burden the military reimbursement process put on soldiers traveling to war zones the choice for us to forgo payment for a third checked bag from the department of defense was clear
4048233 we appreciate and marvel at the bravery and sacrifice our military personnel exhibit daily

4048269 i cant swim faster than kosuke but it could have been possible to get a better result
4048270 and in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about others
4048271 we swam together and i felt like we were training
4048272 those things are in the past now and we must look forward
4048273 i want to thank the fans for their reception against wisla i hope that this season we can enjoy a successful campaign with our new players
4048274 the best is yet to come because we will all continue to work hard
4048275 we played a good game we werent lacking in almost anything
4048276 we created several chances and didnt risk much at the back were satisfied but we mustnt think too much about tonights result we must keep going
4048277 we need to focus immediately on the return game four goals can be enough to go through but only if we play the return match with the same intensity and determination
4048278 we are willing to engage in discussions with unionbancals special committee which has been our policy all along and there is no change to that

4048303 we have seen a prolonged fall in kpit cummins infosystems and then at lower levels there is a really good consolidation if you look at the last five six weeks of data an ascending triangle pattern is being formed yesterday its closing price was rs 67 it hasnt made much of progress today but this stock has a possibility to move up towards rs 77 as an initial target and in case it succeeds in going beyond rs 77 then rs 84 is the likely target for this stock
4048304 on the downside there are two support levels to keep in mind one is rs 65 and another one is rs 60 so definitely some buying can be done and we are close to these support areas for people who are comfortable holding a stock for more than a month i would suggest that they could do part buying at current levels and part buying near rs 60 and have a stoploss point below rs 57 so they can take advantage of any volatility in a market to get properly positioned and then book some profits near rs 75

4048315 when i was three or four my dad mike took me to tazewell country club and i hit balls around while he played
4048316 about four years later we moved to bluefield virginia and my mom sloane and linda taylor helped start the blue ridge junior golf tour i played in the brjgt for several years
4048317 this year i havent played in as many tournaments as in the past but ive practiced nearly every day
4048318 im really looking forward to the pocahontas because its a great tournament and its being played on my home fincastle country club course
4048319 in this tournament you have to compete against the course and play smart
4048320 throughout the round ill be thinking fairways and greens hit fairways and keep the ball below the hole on my approach shots
4048321 making the right decisions is important if you can plan a shot or two ahead of where you are you can save some strokes
4048322 hes a nice guy furman is a good school and they have a very good golf program
4048323 everybodys a little nervous but it was a good experience a great atmosphere
4048324 i dont think its something unique to be satisfied with just making it there
4048325 i think we should set goals to achieve a little higher a little different
4048326 just being a more physical football team coming up and hitting people
4048327 we havent been too good at it the past few years wed like to do that in order to be a better team
4048328 and its something as a player you want to do if you get a big hit youre physical it gets the crowd into it the team into it momentum in the play will follow
4048329 and when he gets into a competitive situation he gets into a football game he is so very focused on that and its going to last hes going to stay out there hes one of these athletes that its impossible to get him off the field unless hes injured so badly you have to carry him off
4048330 hes going to play as hard as he can for as long as he can and that type of leading by example helps the entire offense the entire defense everybody on the football team
4048331 weve got a good number of seniors and hopefully if we can work hard and the younger guys will mature quick well be o k
4048332 the older guys we have to work hard and get in 48 minute shape
4048333 the younger guys got to mature so they can get ready and coming in we can rely on them too
4048334 theyre a good bunch of workers and us older guys have to try to lead them by example and i hope that theyll follow
4048335 whether its out here on the field in the classroom or in your free time on saturday night youve got to do the right thing
4048336 its a lot of fun a lot of responsibility but i try not to think of it as too much just lead my team
4048337 i try to be laid back because generally youre looked at as the leader
4048338 so if youre laid back then theyll calm down too
4048339 i think his attitude kind of like a teacher in a classroom
4048340 his attitude develops a climate for the team and if hes positive and hes confident then that makes the offense a lot more confident
4048341 youve got to keep everybody in line from snap to huddle and everything
4048342 youve got to know about everybodys position youve got to know where theyre supposed to be you have to help them when they have questions and just instill confidence in them that they can do the job
4048343 itd be great to get back there especially with last year and it would be a whole lot of fun
4048344 the playoffs are three four months away and right now were worried about the scrimmage tomorrow
4048345 football is big in bluefield and blacksburg is just as big on football
4048346 i was in born in bluefield west virginia and i moved to blacksburg when i was a year and a half
4048347 i dont really remember much but i have been back there a lot
4048348 ive still got some family that lives in bluefield and down in keystone
4048349 its great to know that i was from somewhere else
4048350 i am from blacksburg but it is a great feeling to know that i am from somewhere else and i came from somewhere else and not just from one area i still have a lot of relatives there i go back and visit from time to time
4048351 i like how it says on hokiesports com that im from bluefield and not blacksburg that is my hometown
4048352 one of the linemen on the opposite team fell down and i was blocking a guy and my leg kind of swung over and got caught underneath him and it kind of twisted it
4048353 it was very frustrating it was my first injury i have ever had
4048354 its been a long process i didnt know how to deal with it at first
4048355 after a while i just got myself motivated listened to what the doctors told me and what my family told me and moved on with it and tried to make myself better
4048356 i was starting but right now i am just trying to get some playing time this year
4048357 it was very frustrating i knew coming back i was going to have to work my way back into it
4048358 i dont expect to come back and start greg and andre and drag have done some great preparation this summer and im been working on my knee throughout the summer playing time is all i want to get this year and hopefully just be on the field
4048359 its just been a great experience its a great program
4048360 throughout high school i knew where i wanted to come i wanted to come to virginia tech coach frank beamer has done a great job with this team and the special teams
4048361 virginia tech is always in the record book for something like consecutive bowl games and having won in a lot stadiums so i wanted to be a part of this family its been a great experience
4048362 ive been running since june 1 so for about two months im still rehabbing and trying to get it back in shape and ready for the first game of the season
4048363 each day my knee is getting better and thats all i can hope for is for it to get better and hopefully be out there on the field in the first game
4048364 the first couple of days were kind of rough trying to get back into football shape but i think as the weeks progress on my knee will get a lot better after i take a couple of hits on my knee in the fall ill feel a lot better about my knee
4048365 bluefield is really big on football especially at graham high school
4048366 i remember playing against ahmad bradshaw and id say if i had stayed down there instead of coming up here i probably would have been playing for graham also
4048367 we played at mitchell stadium and its a wonderful high school stadium
4048368 the atmosphere for a high school stadium is just amazing you wouldnt expect that at a high school level especially at a 2 a school
4048369 i loved the stadium it was a great atmosphere and it was always a good game with graham each year we never played bluefield we thought about it but there were just too many people in our district so we didnt have much left for alternate games
4048370 i think we can be pretty good we have a lot of potential and a lot of young guys that were really good in high school
4048371 i think this year with how young we are in some positions that these guys are going to step up and play really well for us this year
4048372 we did lose a great senior class last year that went into the draft but we still have a lot of guys that were juniors and sophomores last year that have some game experience and can step in for them and fill in really well
4048373 all i can do is just keep working hard and get my knee better each day
4048374 hopefully by the first game ill have the opportunity to get on the field

4048378 coach smith kind of has a big mouth i love him to death
4048379 i didnt really say that but i got a kick out of it
4048380 theres a lot of popping up front there is definitely some pressure coming not an all out rush but definitely some pressure
4048381 but its almost like i have more time because of the blocking scheme up front
4048382 i dont know maybe my high school team wasnt that great at blocking but ive got a good thing going right now
4048383 i try to be confident because thats one of the keys to getting off a good punt
4048384 i didnt really know about it until midway through my senior year
4048385 then my coach told me it was a shock to me thats crazy

4048394 its been a change playing every day but i love it and im happy im here and im having a great time so far
4048395 ive been real happy ive thrown probably 150 innings with the college season and this season
4048396 im just trying to keep doing what i was doing in school and get better and get ready for next season as well
4048397 i was a starter in school so i was used to throwing on a pretty scheduled basis
4048398 im throwing out of the bullpen and im just starting to get used to that and i kind of like it it a different change for me but i enjoy it
4048399 i am a four pitch pitcher and i feel like ill have the opportunity to be a starter
4048400 thats what i think theyre going to try to do with me next year but being that i can come out of the pen or i can start is good i can do either one
4048401 i had been talking to some people and kind of had a pretty good idea that i would probably be drafted
4048402 i was just trying to finish up my last season of school but i was pretty excited about the draft though
4048403 i just wanted to play i wasnt worried about what round i went in it didnt matter to me i just wanted to get my opportunity and i got it and im excited to be here and im having a great time it always has been a dream to play professional baseball
4048404 we were so excited when we found out we got drafted by the same team and then once we found out we were both coming here to princeton we were real happy
4048405 coming in here with somebody you knew it kind of made it a lot easier for us but weve kind of branched out and met new guys so its good i love it
4048406 i think i have a better feel for it just because im from college and im older
4048407 i think going out and just working hard every day not leaving anything behind is a big key to that
4048408 i think were the youngest team in the league and actually i enjoy it because i think i can help some of the younger guys a little with things and with being away from their families
4048409 theyre not used to it so its a change for them
4048410 its harder for them than it would be for me i like being here and helping them its just a good experience all around for me
4048411 i think it helps that were competitive with each other like the pitchers and everything like that but also youve got to do what youve got to do to get there
4048412 working hard for yourself and doing everything you have to do is the biggest thing for me to try and go out every day and work as hard as i can and not give a day away
4048413 im starting to enjoy it its different from where i am from
4048414 its smaller and im starting to get used to it and i like it
4048415 i love playing baseball every day so i love it
4048416 its fine its just a knee dont care if i get a scar there

4048425 we were prompted to this action after meeting les crozier at the salvation army who began working at the hope centre recently he has been doing a similar experiment with his family to find out first hand the type of foods served up in a food parcel
4048426 like les we realise we dont walk in the same shoes as people using the food bank but having an experience such as this may provide us with new insights into the types of food parcels we offer the food we request from donors and the time we expect a food parcel to last for

4048444 in western europe for instance 25 per cent of all people who are on the internet are actively reviewing or commenting about consumer products online
4048445 in the past the web page for a company might have been considered the homepage for a brand
4048446 if you think about it now when searching google and you search for that brand or that brand category thats really in a new way the new homepage for a company
4048447 if there were 10 results on that google page number 10 would be 3m but the nine above it would be social media blog posts consumer sites videos all kinds of stuff
4048448 if you think about someone who blogs or tweets or posts a picture 99 per cent of the time the reason theyre doing that is they want to be heard they want to share their opinion they want to share their ideas

4048606 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments
4048607 operators need to take better control of their network assets so that they can offer a bespoke service to each user on a case by case basis
4048608 in a competitive european market where operators are increasingly trying to differentiate their service and the many millions of corporate subscribers are becoming increasingly international operators surely have no choice but to ensure they maximise all mobile broadband revenue opportunities whilst offering subscribers the best possible service

4048695 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body

4048702 most of our efforts go to promoting confidence in the three legs of the criminal justice stool police courts and prisons

4048710 we have to work to change the political culture of the land
4048711 edutainment is all about using the performing arts to package a message
4048712 a significant development and maturity demonstrating that we are prepared in a non partisan way to give credit where it is due and ensure that future generations can dispassionately judge from the facts make their own analysis and arrive at their own interpretation of our history
4048713 brought to an end the life of a man who had to his credit a distinguished academic career he earned the accolade as a luminary in the legal profession a leading fighter against colonialism and in the struggle for guyanas political independence
4048714 few individuals in guyanese history more so political history have generated such controversy as linden forbes sampson burnham
4048715 the fundamental contention is that a major obstacle to the attainment of such a national consensus is the interpretation of political economy events spanning the four and a half decades from 1953 to the present more pointedly an integral element if not the important factor is the interpretation of the reality of burnhams and his partys rule put another way the basic argument is that any project aimed at national reconciliation and the forging of a broad based consensus for better and more effective governance in guyana is vitally predicated on a coming to terms with burnhams legacy it necessitates a frontal frank and dispassionate assessment of that legacy stripped of the partisan and deeply personal animosities that have so far governed so much of the commentary and analysis of that era and that in fact influence for the worse the behaviour of the respective leadership of the main ethnic groups in the society
4048716 whether we accept it or not guyana is a nation in deep crisis every day we move closer to the brink we have basically two options available to us one option is to sit back and do nothing and witness the steady deterioration into chaos and self destruction the other is to accept our responsibility determine what is required enlist all the professional and other support that is needed and work diligently to ensure that guyana takes its rightful place respected among all the nations of the region and the world the question is whether we have the vision and will to find permanent solutions
4048717 i rise in this debate to give support to the call for due recognition for linden forbes sampson burnham for his extraordinary and outstanding career as a guyanese leader
4048718 was a dominant figure in the politics of our country that his was an extraordinary career that stood against all others challenged only by the no less extraordinary and outstanding career of cheddi jagan whom it appeared faith required to endure and outlast him
4048719 for many years burnham was a dominant and dominating figure in our politics for many years he was striving to stride and was striding over guyana like a colossus
4048720 fascinated and captivated by the youthful cheddi and forbes heralding revolution heralding a new state new relationships between people promising new possibilities
4048721 for a guiana scholar a lawyer to have mixed so closely and familiarly with workers was at that time unprecedented in our country and ran counter to the prevailing socio cultural prejudices
4048722 a visionary and an extraordinary statesman and yet also to just as many as well he was the villain
4048723 burnham was undoubtedly an outstanding student a great orator a gifted lawyer a visionary and wise politician
4048724 that an objective assessment of the man cannot be complete if we attempt to airbrush away his blemishes and buff only his accomplishment the same is true in the reverse were we to diminish his many accomplishments and dredge to the fore his mistakes and blemishes as if to suggest that these were the only defining characteristics of his life
4048725 over time experimented we have critically supported we have condemned we have killed and we have defamed each other sometimes not realizing that we were acting out a script handed to us by our colonial masters and the superpowers
4048726 our presence is not to indulge in hero worshipping but to show that in our leaders both past and present we can find both good and bad we in the afc believe that we cannot move forward unless we confront our ambivalent past not by conflating it and pretending that the good and bad were fused to produce a perfect state rather by disaggregating that past and separating the ignominious from the honourable
4048727 due recognition to the service of mr burnham to the national assembly and guyana by requesting the government to have prepared and published a collection of his speeches spanning his tenure in the national assembly for display in the library of the national assembly
4048728 calls on the government to designate a state institution to be responsible for historical research and documentation to chronicle and archive all of the works of each of the presidents of guyana for the benefit of future generations of guyanese
4048729 less racist than they are less corrupt than they are and less numb to certain things as they are
4048730 we hope that he accomplishes his goal which is to achieve the olympic qualifying time during his race and we know that he will do us proud by giving his best effort
4048731 but we have to quench those desires to make sure we fullfil the role we have been tasked to fill
4048732 having reached a stage of mental or emotional development characteristic of an adult
4048733 welcomed home with a steel band procession from the cheddi jagan international airport timehri to georgetown
4048734 most were minors and all were male poor black and pessimistic about life in guyana
4048735 street police pounced on her and issued an 80 fixed penalty
4048736 i am not a person who throws litter on the street i am a 65 year old woman and i cannot afford to pay 80
4048737 i put my cigarette on the ground and stood on it and as i was picking it up to put in the bin i was approached by two men who told me they were giving me a fixed penalty for dropping my cigarette on the ground because this was a littering offence
4048738 i explained i was just putting it out so i didnt set the bin on fire he told me i should have just put it in the bin and if it caught fire then that was not an offence which i cannot believe and i dont think the fire officers or police would agree
4048739 i didnt do anything wrong and if the men had waited one second they would have seen me put the cigarette in the bin
4048740 people should be clear that throwing down a cigarette butt is littering and no different from dropping a crisp packet or sweet wrapper
4048741 the council will always do its best to stop littering in whitehaven and the rest of the borough it is a growing problem and it makes our towns look unattractive and dirty we do what we can to give visitors and residents a pleasant environment
4048742 before we issued any fines we did lots of educational work in the community explaining why we dont want our streets filling up with litter and that cigarette butts are in fact litter
4048743 there isnt a sign on each building saying dont litter but we would expect most people to realise they shouldnt
4048744 i heard that several people had been fined in what appeared to be a purge by enforcement officers that day
4048745 sir during a short visit to cumberland i stayed for a few days at the flourishing town of maryport i was charmed with the views of the solway and the distant hills and thinking of them as a sign of prosperity i could be tolerant even of the smoky chimneys
4048746 i was a little shocked however to find some of the streets ill paved the gutters running filth and the air tinted with evil odours
4048747 it is impossible for me to leave the neighbourhood without doing something to show how such an abnormal state of affairs impresses the mind of one used to better things
4048748 which in essence is to defend sellafield to deny any unauthorised access to the nuclear fissile material on the site and should the occasion arise to recover control over any lost material we will make sure we are trained and resourced accordingly
4048749 not necessarily we will continue with our patrolling activities on and off the site it is already a visible presence in that the aim is to deter any hostile reconnaissance from terrorists and to provide an important element of reassurance to the local communities
4048750 it is my policy for firearms qualified officers that he or she should certainly carry arms depending on the duties
4048751 i hope the message the community from seeing an armed officer is that by being highly trained and armed they are better able to provide the kind of protective security this provides
4048752 hopefully the public will appreciate the reason why they are carrying arms
4048753 it is an unfortunate by product of our times that there is a very clear intent by al qaeda to detonate a nuclear weapon they have made that very clear from our perspective we need to make sure we do everything we possibly can to prevent them from obtaining certain fissile material from sellafield to further that end
4048754 to coin a phrase from dick cheney americas vice president its the one per cent doctrine if theres a one per cent chance of it happening that is one per cent too many
4048755 we are not in the business of wanting to take that risk nor is the government so we must do everything possible to protect the public from that eventuality ever arising
4048756 you stop it in a number of different ways good leadership is absolutely essential there has to be a clear understanding of the threat of roles of people and good training
4048757 from what ive seen already there are extraordinarily high levels of training commitment and professionalism also by the staff who play an invaluable role supporting police officers on the front line
4048758 we are constantly looking at the latest tactics and procedures al qaeda are using to make sure we have the right levels of protective security to meet the threat
4048759 there is an emergency plan to combat any potential terrorist threat we have a regular programme of exercises against a number of different scenarios these are run hand in glove with the site operator and cumbria constabulary so we make sure we are fully up to speed with each others procedures
4048760 exercises are one thing but we have some really good examples in cumbria of how we have coped with the real thing from the carlisle floods to the grayrigg rail crash with terrorism we have to think sometimes of the unthinkable all sorts of different scenarios
4048761 ive just been to sellafield with richard and seen the quality of training it really is first class stuff including the firearms skills
4048762 yes our officers are up for it we train for it talk about it i am confident that working with the cnc we can cope with a range of threats right across the piece
4048763 we are always on the alert it is important to have the right leadership which we have so i am absolutely confident we would respond to anything
4048764 its conceivable i am not in the business of giving guarantees but you have to understand we have defence in depth so we feel very confident that greenpeace or any other activists would not be able to access very sensitive areas of the site that contain dangerous radioactive material
4048765 we would also look to cumbria constabulary to provide us with the support we would need straight away to manage such an incident
4048766 any sort of penetration of the site would be bad and potentially embarrassing but there are so many different layers of protective security that i feel very confident that greenpeace would find it extremely difficult if not impossible to penetrate the inner areas
4048767 good question anyone who has ever had to use a firearm in anger will know exactly how to deal with it
4048768 encouragingly we are beginning to recruit an increasing number of ex servicemen and women who have been in places like iraq and afghanistan they are proficient in the use firearms
4048769 training of officers is being done in light of the changing environment to make it as relevant as possible to the kind of threat they might face we are looking at the kind of tactics for police officers like ourselves spending more time on the ranges and i have already noticed improvement in the level of skills
4048770 if he or she believed there was an immediate threat to life or possibly injury a method of last resort there are sensitive areas of sellafield which do require protection
4048771 we have a very clear government structure and legal framework in which to work everything we do is in the same way that any police officer authorised to carry arms does we can only operate within the law
4048772 away from the nuclear licensed site our officers also have the full powers of a cumbria police authority constable thats up to five kilometres and anywhere else they may need to go to protect fissile material
4048773 i think the two go hand in hand any unauthorised access to fissile material can potentially cause loss of life
4048774 it was a bit of a wake up call for everybody the type of terrorist threat we now have is different from anything weve had before weve all had to move on to a different footing
4048775 i have the personal experience of being in places like iraq recognising a very determined well resourced highly trained and equipped adversary potentially there is no end in sight for a long time we need to adjust to this new threat to configure and posture ourselves accordingly this is essentially what we in the cnc are doing we are fully plugged in and enmeshed in the intelligence work of cumbria
4048776 most recently i had almost 18 months in iraq a lot of the work there was counter terrorism and counter insurgence related its an experience i can draw on particularly in bringing home to police officers what the threat may look like
4048777 yes in an earlier life while i was in the army serving in northern ireland
4048778 i dont think thats fair to ask id rather not answer the question
4048779 openness is what we aim for short of wanting to protect some of the operational issues but on a day to day basis we are as transparent as we possibly can
4048780 one of the gratifying aspects of coming up to sellafield is to see just how good the relationship is between the constabulary and the site itself you get a real sense of community people working towards a common purpose at no stage do you get a sense of the police being seen as something anyone other than terrorists of course should be even slightly worried about our officers and staff have family members working at sellafield and everyone is completely part of the community a great example
4048781 what it means for us professionally is how our two forces work together how we respond to the threat
4048782 international terrorism poses a threat to us all we have seen a number of recent high profile cases before the courts terrorist training camps in the lake district so it has a real dimension for cumbria thats why our two organisations are so keen on the work we do together at the site sellafield and in the community to make sure we are all in a position to respond and protect the people of cumbria
4048783 we believe that this will save substantial sums of money that we now spend on police details
4048784 we feel it is a reneg on the governors promise
4048785 he came into office pledging to put 1 000 police on the street this is going to take 1 000 police off the street we think that public safety will suffer in the long run

4048920 we owe a lot to the indians who taught us how to count without which no worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made

4048939 sebaik baik wanita adalah yang menawan hati mu bila engkau pandang taat manakala engkau perintah dan menjaga hartamu serta memelihara kehormatan diri nya ketika engkau tidak ada di rumah
4048940 dan barangsiapa yang men taati allah dan rasul nya mereka itu akan bersama sa ma dengan orang orang yang dianugerahi nikmat oleh allah yaitu nabi nabi para shiddiiqiin orang orang yang mati syahid dan orang orang shalih dan mereka itulah teman yang sebaik baiknya

4048966 reached out to woods representatives to express her regrets for the comments
4048967 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4048968 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4048969 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4048970 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4048971 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4048972 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4048973 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4048974 all these areas we controlled since 2003 but now they are coming and attacking and now they are in the control of the government
4048975 they are readying to move to other places the government is cheating us and cheating the international community they are going to destroy all the places to control them
4048976 government soldiers are shooting randomly in the area civilians have been killed and are missing some have fled
4048977 government forces and arab militia are moving north the government is conducting the second round of ethnic cleansing in northern darfur i call on the international community to stop the killing of civilians
4048978 the movement is still in pursuit of enemy forces at various locations
4048979 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4048980 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4048981 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4048982 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4048983 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4048984 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4048985 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4049025 we have to note that there have been enormous steps forward in a number of areas
4049026 manifest failure of the chinese government to keep their promises
4049027 im not asking about how well the games are being run or how wonderful the games are
4049028 are you embarrassed by china i dont think anyone thinks you have answered the question
4049029 the olympic games is largely about the athletes and they have given us extremely strong feedback about how things are going
4049030 are the ioc embarrassed about the chinese governments record on human rights one more chance
4049031 we have to note the enormous steps in the wider area the world is watching and the ioc is appraising
4049032 people enjoy more freedom people are living a good life everyone is happy thats a fact
4049033 of course there are exceptions like in any other country but they need to take the legal process and procedures to resolve any issues we cannot allow this country to be in chaos
4049034 but there are a few people who have come here to peek to be critical to dig into the small details and find fault
4049035 this does not mean that we are not fulfilling our promises over human rights to the ioc the whole country can see how can china has developed how china has genuinely welcomed the world to enjoy everything with us
4049036 i did not promise that china would promise to do whatever with the games in china i did not say that he said

4049047 this is actually really interesting this month by my count we have 11 advisories covering 26 vulnerabilities
4049048 there were originally supposed to be 12 advisories but it appears as though the windows media player update was pulled since this was originally marked critical its not good that its pulled
4049049 its like a being given a treasure map thats half completed
4049050 reguly added pointing out that microsoft appears to be playing catch up by issuing such a large patch slate
4049051 also four of the 12 advisories had vulnerabilities that had already been publicly disclosed and one half of those publicly disclosed vulnerabilities are already being actively exploited
4049052 looks like summer vacation is over a little early for network security professionals after a light july the august patch tuesday will be a very busy one
4049053 the critical updates will affect both desktops and servers so it departments will need to quickly and carefully assess which patches should receive priority
4049054 the five critical patches need to get installed as soon as possible this month
4049055 all of these patches can affect client by attack vectors that are used in day to day client side computer use visiting an evil web site or by opening an evil document
4049056 continuing the ongoing trend attackers are increasingly targeting common users and tricking them into accessing a malicious web site or opening an unsolicited document
4049057 todays bulletins mostly deal with user driven applications such microsoft office including word excel powerpoint access and others such as internet explorer outlook express and windows messenger this is something people need to be aware of and prioritize more sooner than later

4049140 we really had a great time and we cant thank you enough for letting us use your apartment it really is home from home with all the comforts isnt it well situated too bang in the central algarve with great beaches interesting places to visit and high quality restaurants where the only difficulty is which one to choose those stretches between fonte santa almancil and vale de lobo have some great eating places plus there are plenty of more simple alternatives all within striking distance
4049141 the apartment was very accomodating and comfortable a great location with a fantastic pool and the ability to explore the algarve
4049142 fantastic time had by all the apartment was superb and very comfortable a real home from home will definitely come back again and will recommend to our family and friends

4049144 i was confronted with many questions about the opening up and reform of china and i did say that the olympic games coming to china will help china to open up further and to reform
4049145 of course there are exceptions like in any other country some people are not satisfied that is true
4049146 i think a few a very few people come here to speak to be critical to dig into the small details

4049159 now the new gis office in the it department can deploy desktop server and mobile gis software quickly and uniformly throughout the enterprise without worrying about software license procurement
4049160 without this program we would be unable to deploy gis to all of our departments and develop the gis based applications we need
4049161 i would like to showcase what gis can do to enhance operations and the running of the city
4049162 we use it right across everything from operational to commercial
4049163 we use it to plan land use studies and centrally control vehicle movements for building management and leaseholds and demographic data on passengers and employees
4049164 its been an open ended software system thats grown with us and weve been able to upgrade the functionality as the airport has grown
4049165 for employees it helps plan shift patterns and transport links into the site and for passengers it helps understand how and when they travel and their spending power
4049166 the package gives us the ability to amalgamate database tables and land diaries and were able to show them on a map
4049167 it allows us to create address lists of people who live within our sound insulation grant areas and it gives us a good neighbour policy that keeps them informed
4049168 we hope to be working with the transport infrastructure fund and the greater manchester passenger transport executive on transport networks
4049169 we instantly understood the beauty of the survey analyst solution that incorporates cadastral editor and the cadastral fabric data model
4049170 these tools including the least squares tool permit better maintenance of the spatial integrity of our data it gives us sound analysis of measurement data from a wide variety of input sources including cogo tools and or survey data collectors with varying accuracy and reliability the result is a more realistic modeling of the world of cadastral data
4049171 its about truly being able to do parcel maintenance in a very efficient fashion as well as keeping an eye on accuracy
4049172 we can better maintain focus on keeping that base data as precise as possible because we build so many things from it were able to do this very effectively without wasting a lot of resources

4049335 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4049336 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4049337 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4049338 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4049339 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4049340 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4049341 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4049342 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4049343 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4049344 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4049345 one of the obvious things that sun could do in the python world is to make python a supported language in the netbeans ide netbeans has really nice support for ruby and javascript so why should python be left out
4049346 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4049347 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4049352 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

4049358 from the answers of the minister it is clear that he does not know what is going on in the police against the background of more than r1 2 billion worth of claims against the police made last year which the taxpayer has to pay the answer shows incompetence
4049359 wrongful arrests and assaults are direct proof of insufficient training and ignorance if he doesnt know the details how can he take any action to rectify the situation
4049360 the ministers answer is very disconcerting and gives police members a free mandate to act illegally against the public
4049361 those incidents that have occurred have attracted a lot of media attention
4049362 rightly they are concerned we must never dismiss this but we must not overstate it as well
4049363 why is there still a prevalence of racism in schools
4049364 south africa by and large had a very successful programme of integration in schools post 1994
4049365 while we have had incidents that are highly undesirable and certainly need firm action taken against them let us look at the other side of the coin schools that might have been seen historically as a huge challenge to deracialise have been extraordinary shining examples
4049366 it was not part of any policy or regulation in the system what we were recognising were isolated incidents
4049367 against that background i think that what the schools have achieved has been remarkable
4049368 but then we have schools where there are only black pupils and black teachers and they have little experience of dealing with people of other races cultures and backgrounds
4049369 federal courts have declared the health care system in californias 33 state prisons to be poor
4049370 that way you can try your own well do 10 different things but all in miniatures we also do miniatures at brunch

4049380 my hometown news wrote this nice little article about an award i recently won
4049381 when we had originally written the song i really didnt like it at all
4049382 it just sort of came together and became one of my favourite songs
4049383 and i just did it with some kids who were out of ryerson and put it online eventually perez hilton posted it on his site and then it sort of snowballed from there
4049384 refrain from organizing and joining in illegal gatherings and refrain from receiving donations sermons and preaching from overseas religious organizations and groups that have a purpose
4049385 loved this pen used it to mark all my golf balls first time i used identi pen my friend tried to tell me that the ball that was hit the longest was his but the ball had my marks on it thanks identi pen
4049386 identi pen is the best ball marking pen i have used ive scrubbed it in the ball washer fished it out of a water hazard beat it around for a couple of rounds and the mark survives also it doesnt color the face of the club
4049387 great pen for many uses i used identi pen to mark my golf balls and to identify some of my equipment additionally i used it for my childs school items the pen provided a clean permanent and quick drying mark each and every time
4049388 i found identi pen to be a very practical item to test and keep in my bag the two tip widths allow me to be creative with my personal logo i have used it to mark my golf balls and so far the color has remained vivid which is no small feat here in the northwest
4049389 the united cerebral palsy of los angeles was delighted to receive identi pens from sakura of america identi pen was provided to golfers to use while participating in this successful fund raising golf tournament
4049390 i think it is a bit far fetched to always try to seek out a relationship
4049391 chinese artists who were working overseas have started to move back to china and hope to get more attention during the olympics
4049392 by 2000 people began to realize that there was not that much art available from the 1980s and 1990s so the value would be important and we saw many new collectors
4049393 the district has become a fashionable spot with a fake art feel

4049405 when benjamin kleibrink won the gold medal and started celebrating i anticipated that he would make his way over to his coach

4049456 as one of the 100 most technologically significant products introduced into the marketplace over the past year
4049457 as users of the anasys nano ta product we have seen the benefits of localized thermal measurements however this uses an afm platform which is not as common or as easy to use for those in the bulk thermal analysis community the vesta provides an easy to use platform for non afm users to benefit from localized thermal analysis
4049458 vesta is the first tool to enable bulk thermal analysis users to make localized thermal property measurements with ease of use through push button control
4049459 anasys has engineered a thermal probe based metrology tool which uses an optical microscope platform instead of an afm this makes vesta very easy to use and removes the major obstacle to the adoption of localized thermal analysis in the pharmaceutical sector

4049485 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias budget and immediate cash needs

4049497 this attack comes after a chain of unsuccessful attacks targeting the military which all could be interpreted as the vengeful acts of extreme islamists
4049498 although a political agreement was reached in may in the country the understanding remains transitory and superficial
4049499 issues have not yet been handled with depth and the instability witnessed in tripoli is a proof of that

4049575 avneet needs experience and i think she was not prepared enough of course no one expected her to win a medal but she was not in the best shape of her shooting career and it was a very okay sort of performance
4049576 i expected her to shoot 580 plus she was under pressure and this is surely disappointing when you see her score below her ability
4049577 you have to understand that avneet needs to go a long way and this experience is part of her growth and i feel anjali has one more olympics in her and she is still capable of doing well
4049578 it the olympics is a big competition everyone is trying to win and i have worked hard at it at sydney i was new and didnt realise what it was at athens i was too serious and time just wasnt on my side after athens i almost quit

4049793 i was wondering how people on this forum built their net worth
4049794 in the process the government would destroy student communities as well as the local economies that provide for them
4049795 many business corner shops food mini markets and bars included would collapse and students themselves would be robbed of one of the most valuable social experiences a young person can have between living at home and the outside world
4049796 many of these entail expensive modifications to a property and if future housing trends are going to squeeze out the typical terraced private student let then a lot of that work will have to be reversed
4049797 property values will plummet and investments in those areas will start to look shaky meanwhile the local economies that sustain student life will systematically fold up
4049798 and for what reason students usually cant wait to leave halls of residence after their first year and an estimated 75 per cent prefer the independence of sharing a house
4049799 a large part of the university experience is living away from home for the first time and learning self sufficiency and thats what the private rented sector provides
4049800 but caroline flint wants to reduce that provision take away their freedom and herd students back into purpose built barracks
4049801 for all those reasons she cannot be allowed to succeed

4049933 and in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about others my coach said to me that we will have two chinese swimmers in the final so you dont need to force yourself to win gold you just need to try your best
4049934 the pressure was much less we swam together and i felt like we were in training
4049935 i dont know whats veal is that cow yeah veal
4049936 she would drive by and say nice things to us about how we ride
4049937 after a couple days she came up and asked us if we wanted to help her make a skate park because her son had died and that was his biggest wish to have a skate park for myrtle creek
4049938 he was involved in a previous effort to build one that had failed and his parents wanted to donate money for this one
4049939 the hardest part was working with the city and getting the rules of the city and the rules of the skaters to work out
4049940 they presented well they took criticism well they really learned something there
4049941 they have well deserved pride and it will continue for decades to come
4049942 ya loh wah imagine jae yenn having her own clothes line
4049943 then her boutique and clothes line can be named yenn ie
4049944 wahh i help her settle all the paper work and laws to abide then you help her design her shop
4049945 but what i can do she also can do ah i know i help her advertise
4049946 i can think of no justifiable reason why the former nccu leadership would have completely ignored and failed to abide by the appropriate approval process in creating this program such action is contrary to all university policy to say the least it is very disappointing
4049947 bishop long and i didnt talk about the establishment of this program
4049948 we saw it as an opportunity to partner with bishop eddie long and also to provide educational opportunities in what would have been a new market to n c central university
4049949 i will restate what i have previously stated on one point i learned of the affair only a few weeks ago and had previously presumed that the tabloid stuff was all bogus
4049950 the most shocking thing was seeing him on tv give these half truths these half baked answers
4049951 i wish for the well being of everybody involved you know both families i wish he would have just come clean
4049952 rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to conduct a normal life
4049953 generally we played well those first two games but losses are always losses and there is always a fear that we dont recover
4049954 anytime that we have yao on the floor and he is healthy and able to play we feel confident
4049955 our perimeter shooters opened a lot of room for me
4049956 they knocked down every open shot in the first three games i cannot let them down i have to do something
4049957 but the second quarter we played too casual we played without discipline we didnt battle for rebounds
4049958 we relaxed too much we started thinking that game was over but i remember too well that this season that we have played angola twice the first game we lost and the second game we had some problems
4049959 i rischi per la stabilit dei prezzi restano chiaramente orientati al rialzo nellorizzonte di medio periodo e sono aumentati negli ultimi mesi
4049960 sj lland er interessant for os og vi vil ogs gerne tilbage til k benhavn p et tidspunkt men lige nu har vi ikke s konkrete planer
4049961 efter de to f rste vest for storb lt kan det godt blive til stationer st for storeb lt hvor er det for tidligt at r be vi er klar til at g i gang men de sidste tilladelser mangler behandlingen tager lidt l ngere tid i jeblikket fordi de mange kommunesammenl gninger giver ekstra papirarbejde
4049962 det betyder at vi kan spare en del p el regningen
4049963 wie wird der k nstler denn an den werbeeinnahmen beteiligt
4049964 was macht die gema mit youtube und den urherberrechtlichen gesch tzten inhalten schreibt ihr briefe
4049965 wir sind tats chlich in verhandlungen mit den gro en portalen zum beispiel mit rapidshare
4049966 we only have the rights to show programmes on the iplayer for up to seven days after the original transmission date so unfortunately it looks like weve missed our chance with this episode of the adventure show ive been in touch with the people who schedule the programmes for the iplayer and have asked what will happen and how we can avoid this happening again when i get an answer from them ill let you know and will also publish the information on the outdoors site
4049967 but then thats a warning color that its poisonous right
4049968 yeah but its poison is like lethal to other animals not humans
4049969 daniel i sure hope you know what youre doing and not be so engrossed and get stung by that little beast
4049970 jade wasnt sure when she was first approached because she was worried about how the indian housemates and public might react
4049971 she was really upset about everything that happened after the scandal last year she really wants to clear her name and prove to everyone that shes not a racist
4049972 i will be able to empathise with the people in the house better because i have been through the experience and i know what they will be going through at that point of time
4049973 so i think it will be easier for me to relate to them and we are all human beings so i think im going to try and make it hosting bigg boss entertaining with a human touch
4049974 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4049975 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4049976 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4049977 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4049978 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4049979 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4049980 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4049981 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4049982 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4049983 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4049984 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4049985 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4049986 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4049987 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4049988 it was like a dream everybody stood up to applaud and it was so satisfying to see your maiden work receive such appreciation i am humbled
4049989 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4049990 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4049991 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4049992 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4049993 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4049994 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4049995 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4049996 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4049997 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4049998 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4049999 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
