3950004 i know what kind of talent patterson has so id like to give him a chance up here
3950005 the coaches at triple a raved about him so this will be a good opportunity
3950006 hes been one of our best baserunners defensive players and offensive players
3950007 i cant really grab a bat so thats probably why im not playing
3950008 im used to usually having hamstring problems not this little stuff that i cant really control

3950012 hes not afraid we all know that he just gets overwhelmed with aggressiveness by looking and watching i dont think its fatigue hes had days off
3950013 im just giving my best and thats the attitude im try to carry every day
3950014 nothing much else i can do its all about winning what i do personally i couldnt care less as long as we play well as a team and win ballgames thats the most important
3950015 i picked it up wrapped it and never even noticed
3950016 she opened it on christmas morning she put it on and our son noticed it was wrong
3950017 we go to about three games a year and no one ever even mentioned it
3950018 it must have been one of those other countries that has an airborne laser like um new zealand
3950019 one doeth good to oneself by being contented with simple things and free from craving for worldly posessions
3950020 one doeth good to oneself by renouncing desire for luxury and ease and enduring hardship
3950021 one doeth good to oneself by giving up social intercourse and dwelling alone in solitude
3950022 four fifths of the troubles in this life could be avoided if people would just sit down and keep still
3950023 das ist f r die athleten die gr te katastrophe die passieren konnte ich komme gerade von den sportlern f r die gerade die welt zusammen gebrochen ist nach dem auftritt im vorlauf und der art und weise wie sich der vierer hier pr sentiert hat ist es nat rlich doppelt schwer das nun f r uns alle zu verdauen es war richtig dieses projekt so am 8 november auf den weg gebracht zu haben so muss es auch weitergehen
3950024 we dont have the agility of gymnasts the power of a weightlifter or the endurance of a marathoner but we have more agility power and endurance than any gymnast weightlifter or marathoner we do your stuff almost as good as you you cant do our stuff at all and we do stuff neither of us does way better than you can
3950025 we dont have the agility of gymnasts the power of a weightlifter or the endurance of a marathoner but we have more agility power and endurance than any gymnast weightlifter or marathoner we do your stuff almost as good as you you cant do our stuff at all and we do stuff neither of us does way better than you can
3950026 now on to the in4mation tees these tees raise a lot of eyebrows but that s what streetwear does if done properly it get s people talking and thinking the average person may look at these tees and say they are reckless some may say they are borderline genius we have both shirts in men amp women i ll explain the first one the first one just shows a picture of a bloody nose with powder and a mouth some people may look at this and say that it promotes drug use but on the sleeve it says blow blows sick
3950027 we see enormous growth potential in the future and have solid strategies in place to support our goals
3950028 the impact of department stores tightening inventory levels gives us just as much opportunity

3950030 his amendatory veto of the generic drug bill along with others he has issued will set in motion a process that house speaker michael madigan d chicago has followed for a decade because he believes governors sometimes abuse their authority in changing legislation what hes concerned about is a preemptive strikes by the governors office on the work of the legislature said madigans spokesman steve brown
3950031 i think that the lack of clarity from the court decisions may mean that its time for a second crack for the judicial branch maybe we ought to invite the question before the courts whether this particularly amendatory veto for example does go beyond the scope of that authority provided in the constitution for that reason i would suggest that an eye vote may help us answer this question that has been so contentious between the two branches ever since 1971
3950032 there are bounds beyond which a governor cant go but this particular issue before us isnt one of them
3950033 the governor has complete opportunity to be able to take bills like that and rewrite them and in this particular case expand them and widen them and the general assembly can then choose to approve or not approve or ignore what i did to the credit of the house of representatives they acted on it and they voted in favor of that health insurance expansion and its pretty good
3950034 in my mind i think madigan has the better argument because madigan has a long history as somebody whos very concerned about legislative process
3950035 from 95 through 98 jay dee was my go to guy for hot beats and remixes he was always making beats always so there was a select amount of tracks that he composed for me during that time only they never got used when i finally met illa j last year i gave him a cd containing those unreleased beats
3950036 so back in the day in detroit i was just a little kid sitting on the stairs in our house watching him make those first beats for slum village so i always felt my brothers tracks and had an instinct for what i wanted to do over them
3950037 one of the things i learned from my brother is that you dont get that much time so make the most of it
3950038 there has been significant snowfalls with strong winds and widespread avalanche activity is expected on all aspects and elevations

3950042 like always there are always tougher times than others but i think we worked through everything pretty well i like this group so far

3950047 sending a strong message that we in government mean business when it comes to identity theft
3950048 there are constant reports of security breaches and certainly thats cause for concern

3950065 part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups hispanics in particular

3950252 on so many of those records the sound of that weeping guitar is what you hear long before you hear hanks voice
3950253 don told me that one time when he was recording with hank fred rose took his hands and put them out just past the treble strings and said don play up here
3950254 it was freds belief which proved accurate that a high whining sound would cut through the noise of a typical roadhouse or bar where people would be talking dancing and carrying on
3950255 hank sr was always my favorite artist and is still my favorite artist so youd have to say don helms was right there with hank in my mind i think all the sidemen that hank used back in those days were the finest musicians in the world and don was the standout player you heard him more than anyone except the fiddle its a sad thing to see them all go
3950256 i told rodney i heard don play the other day and i just think it would be so authentic and great if we had him play on it
3950257 i dont have any idea if thats the last thing he ever played on it very well could be

3950274 no provision of this act or any amendment made by this act shall be construed as clarifying or implying that internet bets or wagers other than sports bets or wagers which were accepted subsequent to october 13 2006 are in violation of federal law
3950275 federal internet gambling prosecutions have involved sports betting creating a lack of authoritative court decisions on the applicability of other federal criminal statutes to internet poker and casino style gambling
3950276 previous federal case law re mastercard 2002 made it clear that existing federal criminal law wire act of 1961 applies only to sports wagering and not to internet poker further the uigea itself states no provision of this law shall be construed as altering limiting or extending any federal or state law thus h r 6663 only confuses a clear judicial standing on this matter
3950277 the poker players alliance has argued the ban does not apply to internet poker because poker is a legal activity
3950278 so if the alliance supports the new bill and accepts the exemption it would be like admitting that poker is illegal
3950279 people in congress are still trying to eliminate sports betting on the internet when it is very clear that millions wish to exercise their rights as americans and bet online

3950305 mo has the ability to space the floor hes shown himself to be a good shooter
3950306 i like him hes a competitive player that can make big shots and one of those guys that is capable of rising to important times and obviously we want to be playing in those times
3950307 all these guys are very excited they respect mo as a player and theyre looking forward to playing with him
3950308 i think this is a move to be able to get a talented young 25 year old point guard that can be part of the future
3950309 his most productive days in the nba were just a few short years ago when he had ray allen on one wing and rashard lewis on the other wing

3950318 this is about what the car represents and thats really struck a chord

3950328 certainly with the unknown nature of the social security system there could be some dire straits out there ahead
3950329 theyre trying to make ends meet i know many individuals who have children of their own and theyre trying to pay the grocery bill and take care of the gas pump and everything else
3950330 start as young as you can save as much as you can and i realize lots of people its paycheck to paycheck but if you can just find those little things to cut out that you dont need to have and save it can make a huge difference

3950334 were not going to be putting any name plate on it until we can be rest assured it meets all of our standards
3950335 that has been the biggest delay in that product program it did not meet our standards

3950345 all members of the tribes to the 1851 fort laramie treaty have the right to fish within the 1851 treaty territory which includes all of south dakota from the east bank of the missouri river
3950346 in the tradition of gandhi and martin luther king russell means the chief facilitator of the republic of lakotah is organizing a group of lakotah indians to enter sheridan lake recreation area near rapid city south dakota refuse to pay the admission fee and fish without paying the license fee means claims that lakotah retained the right to fish and pass in the 1851 fort laramie treaty territory and that those rights continue today and backed by article vi of the constitution of the united states of america
3950347 the event which is being billed as the lakotah freedom fishing day is about much more than the admission fee or the fishing license fee it is about getting the south dakota and united states governments to follow their own laws
3950348 after having been an occupied nation for over 150 years we have asked the united states government to leave our country meanwhile until the united states government leaves lakotah territory we will take every opportunity to insist it follow its own laws and that its states do the same
3950349 according to the civil right act federal marshalls should arrest any state official who tries to stop lakotah from entering the park and fishing however if the united states ignores its own laws to deny lakotah rights it will certainly not be the first time
3950350 it is however understood that in making this recognition and acknowledgement the aforesaid indian nations do not surrender the privilege of hunting fishing or passing over any of the tracts of country heretofore described
3950351 it is hereby expressly understood and agreed by and between the respective parties to this treaty that the execution of this treaty and its ratification by the united states senate shall have the effect and shall be construed as abrogating and annulling all treaties and agreements heretofore entered into between the respective parties hereto so far as such treaties and agreements obligate the united states to furnish and provide money clothing or other articles of property to such indians and bands of indians as become parties to this treaty but no further
3950352 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
3950353 to somehow suggest obama is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in montana running for president is absurd
3950354 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight
3950355 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3950356 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3950357 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3950358 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3950359 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3950360 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3950361 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3950362 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3950363 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
3950364 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
3950365 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
3950366 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
3950367 but then they disappeared again and this time there were carcasses
3950368 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded
3950369 the frogs have really been hit by a one two punch
3950370 although its more like a one two three four punch
3950371 our work needs to be seen in the context of all this other work and the news is very very grim
3950372 nobel laureate aleksander solzhenitsyn accuses u s nato of encircling russia
3950373 though it is clear that present day russia poses no threat to it nato is methodically and persistently building up its military machine into the east of europe and surrounding russia from the south
3950374 this involves open material and ideological support for color revolutions and the paraxodical forcing of north atlantic interests on central asia
3950375 all this leaves no doubt that they are preparing to completely encircle russia and deprive it of its sovereignty
3950376 never betray in any way the multimillion russian population in ukraine and renounce our unity with it
3950377 foreign policy considering our current situation and possibilities is being conducted sensibly and ever more forward thinking
3950378 but owing to the heavy burden left by his predecessors an awful awful lot in russia has yet to be lifted up from decline the overall state of peoples lives remains hard and chaotic
3950379 this is new york and if the jets go 10 6 and lose in the playoffs it wont be great season itll be here we go again

3950426 i am clear we are going in the right direction its a great club and a big club i want to move it forward
3950427 my part of the club has not changed to any great extent we are interested in good players at the right price
3950428 people might have been concerned that maybe funds wont be available for me to bring players to the club i have been reassured that is not the case we are actively pursuing players
3950429 i had a meeting with all the players the other day and the contents will remain private
3950430 but basically we needed to make the group aware that i am in charge and will make decisions that will affect players
3950431 if players leave then that decision will be mine and mine solely thats where we are and i think everyone understands the situation

3950459 cdhps seem to influence people because of the higher out of pocket costs but not by making people more informed health care consumers
3950460 we did not see more use of health information higher generic drug use or more comparison shopping in terms of diagnostic tests as predicted by proponents what we did see was that people were two to three times more likely to drop off drugs that treat certain chronic illnesses
3950461 there may end up being higher health care costs in the long run so these consumers may be making short sighted cost saving decisions that may have higher cost and unfortunate health ramifications

3950472 we have discovered a tiny specialized computer inside a primitive round worm
3950473 this computer does some nice calculus differentiating the rate of change of the strength of various tastes the worm uses this information to find food and to avoid poisons
3950474 in effect they have two nostrils or two tongues but they are so close together that it is really like having one nostril or one tongue and yet they find their way around quite effectively
3950475 we knew from behavioral experiments that nematodes were doing the same thing that humans were doing but only from the view of behavioral responses we didnt know what was going on in the brain
3950476 at this point we wanted to know if these neurons really are controlling behavior if asel really signals that things are getting better then if you could artificially activate asel the animals ought to go straight like a human going directly toward the pizza
3950477 conversely if you activate the aser the animals ought to turn to find their goal
3950478 we have discovered a tiny specialized computer inside a primitive round worm
3950479 the computer calculates the rate of change of the strengths or concentrations of various tastes the worm uses this information to find food and to avoid poisons
3950480 there are strong indications that a similar device exists in the human nervous system

3950510 the numbers to me were not a surprise they were consistent with others numbers id heard
3950511 this is a call to urgent action on the reduction of air pollutants and we need a strategy across the country that reduces the emissions that are causing this critical literally speaking critical health problem

3950517 funding costs for the banks across all sources had probably fallen by about 25 to 30 basis points in recent weeks he told a federal parliamentary committee hearing in sydney
3950518 people have been pushing the banks to give more commitment to the fact that they would follow the reserve bank when the reserve bank cuts interest rates
3950519 the banks have responded to that quite cautiously and have been quite non committal
3950520 my guess is really whats happening here is the banks are saying well its unreasonable for them to give commitments when they dont know when the rba is going to move or by how much
3950521 thats why we now find we are in a position to cut interest rates mr battellino added
3950522 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late mr battellino said
3950523 overall when we look at all the evidence which we have its reasonable to conclude that the australian financial sector is competitive and that it stacks up quite well across a range of international benchmarks
3950524 our view is that these recent events are cyclical in nature and do not represent permanent change to the structure of the market in the sense that when markets settle we expect securitisation to pick up again mr battellino said

3950530 have the gardenia the price is 16 05 20 86 for 10 ml 2 09 for the shipping its gorgeous
3950531 i am sure youll love the gardenia i have been blending some nice floral and fresh scents with it one will be in the samples and the good thing about it is that you dont need to put many drops
3950532 ive been meaning to ask you about the gardenia oil i recently bought you see i wanted to find out more about gardenia and checking around and reading i found out that the yield of the oil or absolute from the flower is something like 1 kg oil from 5000 kg of the flowers how could the price of the oil you sent me be correct given that it is the real thing are you 100 certain that it is the natural absolute of gardenia far be it for me to question you as i know you are in the business a lot longer than i am so i hope you dont take offense to me asking you as there is none at all intended i just had to ask you i hope you dont mind
3950533 you are correct about the yield of 5000 kg of flowers to produce 1 kg of oil but where there is a huge difference with lets say rose for instance is that tiare flowers which is the tahitian name for gardenia tahitensis are found in very very huge quantities in tropical countries plus they are much easier to extract than the rose the reason for the cheap price is that my supplier owns a distillation factory directly in the country india in this case so it is direct from the producer
3950534 enjoy working with this gardenia i just love the results i get with it
3950535 sorry about my long delay in responding to your email thanks for going to all the trouble of writing it took me so long for one reason i didnt know what to say to you but saying nothing is not good either i have to tell you that i dont buy what you are telling me i am not saying that you are telling me stories as i dont think that but i just dont believe what you believe to be true
3950536 the main reason is the price but the smell is also suspect to me and i noticed that first it smells like a synthetically produced oil i buy lots of absolutes oils and concretes straight from the producers growers and while the price is lower than if i was buying it second or third hand there is never that much of a difference the best price i was given for pure rose otto straight from the producer rose grower is 35 00 bps per 10g not including shipping and i found out that that is the going rate unless you are buying it in very very large quantity the price above is if i buy a kilo which cost me 3 500 00 bps as i said before the yield of absolute from the gardenia flowers is very low 1kg from 5000 kg of flowers even if there are lots and lots of flowers the yield output stays the same in fact the yield of otto from roses is higher that that of the absolute from the gardenia flower gardenia absolute is very rare as not a lot of producers will bother with such a low yield oil i hope you dont take this personally as i do not mean to offend you at all i have to be honest and tell you what i think and the conclusion i have arrived at or else i am not being true to you
3950537 i am sorry to hear about your opinion i prefer not to take your word against my suppliers word and will proceed to a refund onto your paypal account immediately i never had such comments from anyone before and i know who i deal with and what i use for my perfumes i would never put the credibility of my long term supplier in doubt however i think you should get your facts and suppliers right gardenia absolute is not rare it is heavily produced in indonesia sumatra and india and maybe get to smell a real tiare flower from tahiti where by the way they do produce an absolute from tiare flowers called extrait de tiare in french the supplier is a major uk based company and would not take the risk to sell crap to anyone particularly as their biggest clients are organic certified and ecocert companies the synthetic smell is probably the solvent used for the extraction although knowing tiare flowers since i was a child i beg to differ with your interpretation this is not honesty ruth this is slagging off someone and sentencing someone without waiting for all the facts maybe your suppliers do rip you off after all
3950538 the chemicals given in bold are generally used in synthetic formulations but without a comparison scan of the real thing you can not be sure there is nothing listed that would be impossible in a plant extract but just very unlikely at those levels

3950549 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3950550 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3950551 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3950554 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3950555 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3950556 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3950557 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3950558 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3950623 begging for help and the va kicked him to the curb
3950624 more than five years after the start of the iraq war we should have the resources in place to treat the psychological wounds of war as well as we do the physical ones but we dont
3950625 when someone with a history of depression ptsd or other psychological wounds walks into the va and says they are suicidal it should set off alarm bells we cant convince veterans or service members to get care if they think they will be met with lectures and closed doors
3950626 time and again it has taken leaks and scandals to get the administration to own up to major problems at the va from inadequate budgets to rising suicide rates and its response to rising costs has been to underfund research and cut off services to some veterans service members and veterans need more than an 800 number to call
3950627 the facts show va lacks consistent and complete policies and oversight on the subject of suicide as va leaders confirmed during the trial in the lawsuit veterans brought against va
3950628 because va failed to start collecting national suicide data until after we filed our lawsuit
3950629 if va looked determined if there was a suicide problem and if va found there was a suicide problem then va would be forced to address the suicide problem vcs believes that congress should order va to collect robust suicide data so that va doesnt change their mind or somehow lose the data
3950630 there is an epidemic of suicides among our veterans especially our younger veterans
3950631 the evidence of this was presented by the cbs evening news and the university of georgia in their november 2007 report indicating veterans are twice as likely to complete a suicide than non veterans even worse and an ominous indicator of the severity of the iraq and afghanistan wars on the minds of our veterans younger veterans aged 18 to 24 are between three and four times more likely to complete a suicide than non veterans of the same age veterans are screened for pre existing conditions before entering the military and their suicide rate should be lower not higher
3950632 the va may not be meeting all of the needs of the nations veterans
3950633 congress the secretary of the department of veterans affairs the adjudication system within the va and the federal circuit
3950634 va remains mired in crisis as shown by vas refusal to provide care to lucas senescall jonathan schulze and jeffrey lucey
3950635 if there is not substantial improvement soon at va such as reducing waiting times for treatment and disability benefits as well as immediate care for mental health emergencies then the crisis will continue to deteriorate further
3950636 the ultimate person responsible is president george w bush he had no plan to occupy iraq for five years other than to escalate the violence and no plan to care for our veterans other than to conceal the casualties now our veterans are returning home and we must act where president bush and his incompetent political appointees failed
3950637 given that we are having more and more compensation seeking veterans id like to suggest that you refrain from giving a diagnosis of ptsd straight out
3950638 we really dont or have time to do the extensive testing that should be done to determine ptsd
3950639 is the fact that were stopping suicides good news or is the sheer number bad news and is this more than weve ever seen before it might be something we drop into a general release about our suicide prevention efforts which as you know far better than i prominently include training employees to recognize the warning signs of suicide
3950640 our suicide prevention coordinators are identifying about 1000 suicide attempts per month among the veterans we see in our medical facilities is this something we should carefully address ourselves in some sort of release before someone stumbles on it
3950641 vas own data demonstrate 4 5 suicides per day among those who receive care from us
3950642 several veterans expressed to my staff their frustration after receiving a diagnosis of ptsd from a team member when they had not received that diagnosis during their compensation and pension examination
3950643 this situation was made all the more confusing and stressful when a team psychiatrist correctly told them they were displaying symptoms of combat stress but did not meet criteria for the diagnosis of ptsd
3950644 in retrospect i realize i did not adequately convey my message appropriately
3950645 my only intent was to improve the quality of care our veterans receive
3950646 once again vas political appointees were taken to the woodshed by an alert congress for repeatedly failing our veterans
3950647 remains disappointed that the va leaders selected by president bush lied again to congress when said that va has enough resources to assist veterans during the hearing the temple texas ptsd director who is not a political appointee dr norma perez told congress that veterans were scheduled only for a half hour psychological assessment for ptsd claims she said some veterans require a more complete assessment that could take up to three hours this was a stunning admission that va lacks the proper number of mental healthcare professionals to accurately and consistently evaluate veterans seeking healthcare and disability benefits for ptsd
3950648 right now va is treating 325 000 iraq and afghanistan war veterans including 133 000 for mental health problems
3950649 there are long waits to see doctors 25 percent wait more than one month according to vas inspector general and even longer waits to receive disability claims the average wait is a staggering six months according to the veterans benefits administration
3950650 we can do this by welcoming home our veterans in our communities our workplaces and our religious institutions
3950651 the power to proceed because their structures and procedures violate both the uniform code of military justice and the four geneva conventions of 1949
3950652 no civil court justice or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider any claim or cause for action whatsoever relating to the prosecution trial or judgment of military commission s including challenges to their lawfulness
3950653 attorney general wants new declaration of war allowing indefinite detention and concealment of torture
3950654 an enormous executive branch power grab authoriz ing indefinite detention s through a new declaration of armed conflict
3950655 that will hide the bush administrations past wrongdoing an action that would undermine the constitutional guarantee of due process and conceal systematic lawless torture and abuse of detainees
3950656 the last gasp of an administration desperate to rationalize what is a failed legal scheme
3950657 but there is no reason to think that congress will assist him
3950658 wont fall for this latest scheme to suppress its wrongdoing
3950659 no need to invent yet another set of legal rules to govern the detention and trial of prisoners held on national security grounds and the rules that mukasey is proposing are fundamentally inconsistent with
3950660 michael mukasey is not fit to be attorney general because he supports torture illegal spying on americans and limitless powers for the executive branch
3950661 firmly against mukaseys nomination our country cannot afford to make compromises to our laws our morals and our humanity any longer
3950662 what mukasey is doing is a shocking attempt to drag us into years of further legal challenges and delays the supreme court has definitively spoken
3950663 have done their best to deny due process and prevent the courts from reviewing the legality of the detention of the men in guantanamo congress should be a part of the solution this time by letting the courts do their job
3950664 mukasey seeks law on detainees congress is urged to limit rights of terror suspects in light of a rebuke by the supreme court
3950665 reaffirmation of something that was enacted in legislation after september 11 2001
3950666 was right in stepping forward to say that someone has to take responsibility for the consequences of the supreme courts 5 4
3950667 congress to give one court jurisdiction over all detainee cases
3950668 bog down into a babel of conflicting procedural and legal rulings
3950669 la intervenci n soterrada permitida por el presidente de la rep blica leonel fern ndez y las autoridades competentes aunque se diga que es colaboraci n entre gobiernos democr ticos y concepci n global de la justicia
3950670 este repudio y esta indignaci n se potencian cuando la injerencia y la presi n que la acompa an provienen de un r gimen criminal torturador promotor del terror de estado y del paramilitarismo comprometido en masacres espeluznantes y estrechamente asociado a los carteles de drogas y los planes de guerra de ee uu en la regi n
3950671 en despachos militares palaciegos y judiciales a instancias del r gimen colombiano
3950672 poner cuanto antes en conocimiento del pa s tanto los pedidos de las autoridades colombianas como la postura oficial
3950673 claridad responsabilidad renuncia al ocultamiento y a las tratativas a la sombra del silencio de esos pasos
3950674 ponerle fin a la fase secreta de esta trama seudo judicial asumiendo cada quien sus responsabilidades frente a la sociedad
3950675 i dont think that any of us are particularly happy to raise fares now
3950676 i hope the community at large understands this is something we do with a heavy heart
3950677 this isnt going to fix it and if we raise it again it isnt a fix
3950678 if it got to around 5 one way then id consider buying a car
3950679 his amendatory veto of the generic drug bill along with others he has issued will set in motion a process that house speaker michael madigan d chicago has followed for a decade because he believes governors sometimes abuse their authority in changing legislation what hes concerned about is a preemptive strikes by the governors office on the work of the legislature said madigans spokesman steve brown
3950680 i think that the lack of clarity from the court decisions may mean that its time for a second crack for the judicial branch maybe we ought to invite the question before the courts whether this particularly amendatory veto for example does go beyond the scope of that authority provided in the constitution for that reason i would suggest that an eye vote may help us answer this question that has been so contentious between the two branches ever since 1971
3950681 there are bounds beyond which a governor cant go but this particular issue before us isnt one of them
3950682 the governor has complete opportunity to be able to take bills like that and rewrite them and in this particular case expand them and widen them and the general assembly can then choose to approve or not approve or ignore what i did to the credit of the house of representatives they acted on it and they voted in favor of that health insurance expansion and its pretty good
3950683 in my mind i think madigan has the better argument because madigan has a long history as somebody whos very concerned about legislative process
3950684 the world jewish community is calmer now about president chavez he has demonstrated that is a great friend of this community
3950685 join in on the work together with presidents lula da silva and cristina fernandez of brazil and argentina to achieve the eradication of anti semitism in latin america and the need to put an end to all types of discrimination in latin america
3950686 vi skulle vilja ha biljetter till i kv ll och till i morgon kv ll
3950687 do you feel that you could do that i mean i dont see you doing that ive always felt that that is something im just born with and im not sure you are
3950688 the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
3950689 to show to russia that we can come to the aid of a european ally and that we can do it at will whenever and wherever we want
3950690 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3950691 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3950692 we were unhappy with the initial actions of the american officials because they were perceived by the russians as green lines basically but this one was very strong
3950693 we wont be protecting the airport or seaport but well certainly protect our assets if we need to
3950694 to continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
3950695 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can invade its neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3950696 this time of year is kind of what i call the dog days of food donations
3950697 we average about 250 300 families come through the food pantry each month
3950698 the food pantry has helped me when ive been in need and when im trying to help somebody in my family or some neighbors
3950699 if i had to cook the rice make the meat cook some vegetables in here buy a head of lettuce or a watermelon and a canteloupe for one person this would go to waste i wouldnt be able to keep it that long
3950700 the other side of this is that ive got four trucks on the road every day diesels now nearly 5 a gallon and i deliver half of the food
3950701 our biggest challenge is to make sure the food keeps coming in
3950702 so this is really more economical for me and at the price of things yes it does help

3950712 i dont agree with how the lex blames it all on bd haters
3950713 i think its much more than that it was lex haters
3950714 from what i understand the hacking had nothing to do with the books but rather the manifesto that the lexicon recently put up which pretty much took away posters freedom to share their true opinions on the book
3950715 i dont agree with what the hacker did but at the same time i think the lexicon is taking things just a tad too far the manifesto isnt the first time they have tried to take control of the fandom
3950716 i received a call monday saying i could qualify for the tickets if i do 12 hours of volunteer work for the obama campaign between now and friday the 15th
3950717 to work 40 hours at my job get to and from work get to and from the campaign office and complete the 12 hours in three days would be next to impossible
3950718 people who read are the ones wholl care about me love me still and who mm yes i know im bitchy will be on my side
3950719 the first defendant and the second defendant were notified of the listing today
3950720 it would appear at this stage there is no appearance
3950721 i see no reason why the court shouldnt act in accordance with the wishes of the parties judge emmett said
3950722 the same corruption issues have arisen in several previous icac investigations into railcorp
3950723 to deal with these serious issues the final report in this series will canvass all of the corruption prevention issues raised during the various segments of the current investigation
3950724 there remains a substantial amount of cash unaccounted for which was apparently spent on shopping restaurants holidays and gambling
3950725 it is an indication of the strength and quality of australian higher education that we perform so well in world class competition
3950726 in the future we can expect to see chinese universities bulking larger in the top 200 and then the top 100 as the hyper investments in research and development of the past 10 years begin to bear fruit in stellar research performance
3950727 full funding of research currently under discussion is very important because it means research no longer has to be subsidised from resources generated by local and international students
3950728 were certainly seeing some cooler temperatures associated with the dry south westerly airstream

3950733 to me the most attractive thing about him is his versatility hes 6 6 215 pounds with a 6 11 wingspan he can definitely expand his game hes fundamentally sound he can put the ball on the floor and guard multiple positions
3950734 im honored to be recognized by the coaches in the league
3950735 i showed them what i can do and i guess they trust me to play at that level
3950736 her contributions have been numerous not just on the court but with her leadership ellens a winner and its rubbed off on everyone else in the program
3950737 we battled our way to come away with two wins i was pleased with the fight and the scratch and the claw to get a victory
3950738 we have to get ready i know that reitz is very good i dont know they have any weaknesses theyre good enough to play with us
3950739 i think we have our identity i also think we saw an opportunity slip away that we thought we could do something with i think the players will dedicate themselves a little more than normal in the off season
3950740 canadians put way more pressure on professional sports do we value amateur sports in our country yeah i think we do but dont think we invest in it really heavily yet
3950741 its like i imagine being a man its like being kicked in the nuts repeatedly thats how bad it feels you feel like you want to curl up and die
3950742 despite some bright spots our summer olympic team is not very good
3950743 diving is not here to support canada on its own
3950744 the games have just started people are still training for their events theyre still competing and the medals are going to come
3950745 i think any time you put up 10 runs in a game its a good one
3950746 any of the eight guys could be on the podium i have to calm down go relax and get focused
3950747 the first fencer i fought had a very strong technique which better suited my fencing style i prefer attacks which give me more time to react
3950748 the italian sanzo in my second bout was very fast and because of his style i had little time to react he dominated throughout the competition
3950749 so you must be pretty disappointed world ranked before this event and yet something happened
3950750 come 2 dress 2 impress b c we stay clean in this bitch

3950776 la rivoluzione arriva nel momento in cui la crisi assume caratteristiche catastrofiche spiega il rapper ma non siamo lontani da quel momento
3950777 la vera rivoluzione come ci insegna la storia scatter quando la smetteremo di sentirci semplicemente scocciati dallo stato delle cose puntualizza frankie e quando caduti talmente in basso non avremo altra scelta che ribellarci e cercare quindi di ripristinare i valori che fino a poco fa erano le vere cose che contavano e che ci guidavano
3950778 la musica arte e in quanto tale ci aiuta a vedere con maggiore chiarezza la realt che ci circonda larte infatti rappresentazione della realt e proprio secondo lo stesso principio lo scrivere una canzone diventa strumento per rappresentare il mondo con uno sguardo pi attento e disincantato
3950779 allepoca con quelle parole avevo voluto esasperare la descrizione di quelli che benpensano ma oggi quella finzione stata addirittura superata dalla realt stessa
3950780 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me if you have known me you will also know my father
3950781 if you want to know god you can only do it through me period
3950782 what room do you have to talk you probably dont know anything about other religions
3950783 this is ultimately what i like about the born again lifestyle even though i see fundamentalist christians as wild eyed maniacs i respect their verve they are probably the only people openly fighting against americas insipid oprah culture the pervasive belief system that insists everyones perspective is valid and that no one can be judged
3950784 oh look they are in their 40s and they act like children ha ha ha ha ha ha
3950785 does anyone give a shit about those fucking losers anymore
3950786 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
3950787 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3950788 during the preseason ill always talk to the other quarterback before or after the game and were all asking hows the arm holding up
3950789 i was getting sacked earlier in the game holding the ball and the falcons tried to rip it out and i held the football in
3950790 that put a hole in the forearm muscle tore it and that put all the stress on the elbow
3950791 thats why on the little throw to brad the ligament went
3950792 you take one of the premier quarterbacks out of the game your team is going to struggle
3950793 we always believed you have to be good up front and your running backs set the tone
3950794 the other defense gets tired and our defense stays fresh it makes it fun
3950795 manny has certainly picked up the personality of this team
3950796 people were eager for a superstar which we had not had here since mike piazza left
3950797 hes got something special hes got a personality hes got a presence
3950798 hes got enthusiasm for the game and hes got some style and cachet to how he does it
3950799 theres no question theres been a different feel in the stadium since hes been here the superstar player is adored in many places here particularly
3950800 i went through all this when i did barry bonds contract in 2002 he signed a five year contract for 90 million when he was 38 and mannys only 36
3950801 in boston you can go in the green monster not here
3950802 mannys always smiling he likes to hug people do those funky handshakes
3950803 thats something the dodgers didnt have that helps because it encourages bonding
3950804 he brings a light in here he gets us loose and ready for the game
3950805 hopefully he stays here for a long time and i can keep learning from him
3950806 weve had our injuries but everyone goes through injuries we should have the talent to withstand injuries
3950807 the good teams overcome it thats why i will never write off the yankees
3950808 this underscores the emphasis weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player
3950809 its been a team effort all year i expect it to continue
3950810 at first i tried to just shove it in real hard and push the refrigerator door closed
3950811 it was too tall so i had to lower the shelf a notch
3950812 you put the bucket in your lap and eat right over it
3950813 that way you catch and save all the little fried bits and eat them when youre out of chicken
3950814 i could hear everything fall out when i shut the door i think because its slanted
3950815 sometimes when you leave me my body just wants to cry and cry
3950816 as i say even if you know who has gone
3950817 on the campaign trail john mccain likes to brag about chairing the senate indian affairs committee that investigated criminal lobbyist jack abramoffs role in the republican culture of corruption
3950818 but that is not stopping john mccain from raising campaign cash with one of abramoffs closest business partners scandal plagued conservative activist ralph reed
3950819 that democrats who appear on the colbert report enjoy a significant increase in the number and total amount of donations they receive over the next 30 40 days when compared to similar candidates who do not appear on the show specifically democrats who come on the program raise 8 247 more than colleagues who dont do so on the 32nd day following their appearance

3950825 jump out and if you can fly ill let you back in
3950826 give me a challenge and ill meet it with joy

3950841 they do not seem to be based on any solid evidence
3950842 our experience from over 10 years of gm cultivation shows that gm technology has been found to deliver real environmental and economic benefits
3950843 at a time when demand for food and fuel is rising and in the face of growing environmental challenges we need to find ways to feed an ever increasing global population
3950844 even for a prince whos a long established champion of organic farming and critic of gm crops these are comments which verge on the extreme
3950845 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3950846 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3950847 that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3950848 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness

3950857 from the moment that sarah first announced that she was assembling the tour the media began to nibble
3950858 she painted a picture of lilith fair as petty and utterly lacking in any community and described the press conferences as having an underlying sense of competitiveness which resembles the uncomfortable alliance of a nato meeting
3950859 vowell accused sarah and company of nailing a pretty pink sign to their cute clubhouse marked no boys allowed
3950860 ouch she winced ah i was so naive about the role of media darling i had never been in that position before i didnt understand that you get pushed up there and then punched down in the muck thats the muck

3950911 should be opened to the community making trinity a centre of family activity as it had been in the past
3950912 we have been receiving e mails from all sorts of people thanking us for organizing the centre more than ever there is a real need to provide convenient close to home learning opportunities at affordable prices
3950913 we have structured classes in a variety of progressive sessions so that people can participate in what is affordable to them
3950914 we had opened a little new section for small trailers and tents we staked out seven lots
3950915 its been a challenging year for farmers in some respects
3950916 rain is good but this year its been a case of too much of a good thing
3950917 shop early morning and we hope for more product to meet the requests this week

3950919 we would think that the b i a as a courtesy would have followed up on them of the public notices
3950920 we tell them they can stay at the best western eat at boston pizza and enjoy the shopping
3950921 a vision at that time to reach out and minister to the people of shelburne but the congregation went through a difficult time in the early 1990s and attendance declined dramatically
3950922 worshipping at a variety of rented facilities after the sale of this building with access only on sunday morning for a few hours made it difficult for the grace church to establish any kind of permanent ongoing programs
3950923 the outlook and atmosphere in the church has changed significantly as new people are beginning to attend
3950924 we are looking forward to the day when our new facility will be built and we will have the ability to minister to all ages for christ and his kingdom here in the shelburne area
3950925 within the denomination of the church of the nazarene as to how to make sure in its next 100 years that it stays true to its holiness biblical roots
3950926 grace church in shelburne has met the challenge of staying true to its biblical roots through its affiliation with different denominations through its first century of existence it is my prayer that the passion of a holy lifestyle and desire to remain true to the bible will remain strong throughout the coming century should jesus tarry in his second coming
3950927 i will keep up these challenges forever i think they are very healthy for both of us this show has seriously helped us out
3950928 we dont need visas to transit through dubai flying through the us is much harder we need visas and we have to line up for interviews at the us consulate
3950929 he was great he really made us think and told us when something was bullshit

3950931 it is ms wangs position that ms ev like all of us has the right to expect her lawful power of attorney prepared when there was no doubt as to her capacity to be honoured and those who maintain they are acting out of her interests and fail to protect those interests at the ccb and in the courts need to be appropriately dealt with within the rules of the court
3950932 could it happen at one of the small storage facilities here

3950934 but we have to balance it with the ability of what seniors and others who have to take a taxi are able to pay
3950935 hopefully that will help the taxi companies keep the rates current
3950936 the increases have to be as high as we proposed
3950937 there can be vouchers given to senior citizens for a discount but the increases have to be higher the people depending on the business to make a living just arent going to make it otherwise
3950938 if the companies dont receive an equitable increase we wont have four cab companies to choose from in this town
3950939 can we phase this increase in or is the need immediate
3950940 is the one to be in its like the masters in golf
3950941 we are very pleased with the success of this years championship
3950942 in particular it was encouraging to see that about one third of the saturday night audience had never previously been to the championship we couldnt do this without the people who have been attending for many years but we need to attract new people as well this continued success means that our rotary club will be able to this year fund numerous charitable projects both in the local community and around the world
3950943 is the priority to get traffic through fast or is to get traffic through with minimal effects on wildlife

3950950 i cant keep doing this keep chasing through the darkness to discover what might just be a wild search for nothing
3950951 theyll never let you publish your findings no one will ever believe you its too fantastic
3950952 anyone who even believed would never think to look in canada the land of innocent bystanders i didnt think of it myself until i started watching canadian television and catching the news up there their head of state is nearly as bad as any of the rest he is somewhat impeded by the canadian nature but if he gets in during their next elections he wont be any better than the rest i was sure he was one of them weve got to prove it scullery weve just got to i know im right about this theyre based in canada but they went too far they took a canadian they were bound to make a mistake somewhere along the line
3950953 but look over there heres a bonus we didnt expect
3950954 and our newly intensified arms development program is in full swing
3950955 but what about environmental concerns on the location of the mines there are valuable sources of water and a sensitive eco system in most of those regions
3950956 and we are conducting several studies to concur that minimal damage will be done to the eco systems
3950957 we have allowed ten years or so for them to be completed
3950958 but construction on the mines is meant to start straight away
3950959 i should like to bury something precious in every place where ive been happy and then when i was old and ugly and miserable i could come back and dig it up and remember

3951054 cities are huge richly detailed artifacts that are often required in digital productions and modeling them with existing tools can take many years
3951055 cityengine addresses these previously unsolved modeling problems by offering several procedural modeling tools for generating large scale urban layouts as well as a unique shape grammar for the efficient creation of detailed building models with these tools users not only experience a faster modeling experience but one that allows them to create cityscapes that have never been seen before
3951056 i think one of the advantages of cityengine is that you can model very high res models or low res models for a web application or previsualization for example
3951057 spatialize and present information and theories about how the city looked on june 21 320 a d which was more or less the height of its development as the capital of the roman empire
3951058 cityengine is a perfect match for the rome reborn project
3951059 our project involves the complete virtual reconstruction of the city at its zenith under emperor constantine when it had about one million residents to build by hand the corresponding 7 000 apartment buildings family houses public buildings and temples would have taken us forever but cityengines power and flexibility made the process amazingly quick without sacrificing detail or quality this allowed us to concentrate on modeling the unique monuments the cityengine also helps to quickly change the model as new scholarship or discoveries warrant
3951060 the good thing about the procedural approach is that you always can change things without losing anything you have done before
3951061 so for a typical application example you have modeled a building design in a very very detailed way and then afterwards the art director or project director changes the massing of the whole thing and suddenly decides that now the skyscrapers have to be bigger in the procedural approach you just have to change one parameter and the skyscrapers are bigger the whole detail is still there everything is correct the procedural modeling approach is really that you have a very flexible model which you can change after two days or after one month
3951062 after the rome building designs had been specified in the cityengine generating and exporting the entire city model took exactly one hour and 55 minutes thus rome actually was built in one day or at least its digital counterpart was

3951126 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos

3951130 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3951131 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3951132 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3951133 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

3951144 seek help in patience and as salat and truly it is extremely heavy and hard except for the true believers in allah those who obey allah with full submission fear much from his punishment and believe in his promise and his warnings
3951145 those to whom the people said surely men have gathered against you therefore fear them but this increased their faith and they said allah is sufficient for us and most excellent is the protector so they returned with favor from allah and his grace no evil touched them and they followed the pleasure of allah and allah is the lord of mighty grace it is only the shaitan that causes you to fear from his friends but do not fear them and fear me if you are believers

3951164 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3951165 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3951166 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3951167 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3951168 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales

3951170 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3951171 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3951172 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3951173 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3951174 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3951175 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3951176 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3951177 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3951178 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso

3951193 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3951194 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3951195 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3951196 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3951197 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3951198 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3951199 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3951200 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3951201 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3951202 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3951203 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3951204 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3951205 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3951206 this is how it should be done cause this style is indentical to none
3951207 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3951208 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3951209 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3951210 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3951211 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3951212 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3951213 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3951214 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3951215 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3951216 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3951217 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3951218 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3951219 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3951220 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3951221 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3951222 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3951223 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3951224 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3951225 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3951226 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3951227 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3951228 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3951229 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3951230 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3951231 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3951232 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3951233 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3951234 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3951235 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3951236 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3951237 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3951238 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3951239 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3951240 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3951241 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3951242 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3951243 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3951244 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3951245 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3951246 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3951247 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3951248 en un mundo que nos quiso convencer de que se hab an acabado las ideas siempre han transformado la vida de las sociedades
3951249 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3951250 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3951251 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3951252 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3951253 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3951254 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3951255 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3951256 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3951257 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3951258 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

3951260 as a first step it is long past time for the senate to pass the broadband data improvement act s 1492 which would improve our nations broadband data collection and provide funding to states for public private partnerships to increase broadband deployment and adoption
3951261 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
3951262 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl cable modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
3951263 it does suggest that diversity in this country is hitting the whole population more rapidly especially in the younger population
3951264 we have all these set notions of who works in what area and what type of person is employed in certain areas
3951265 even if we had not projected an increase in immigration the natural increase of the hispanic population is quite a bit higher than the non hispanic population

3951343 meskipun para dokter pernah mengganggap bahwa masalah masalah seksual bersumber pada sebab sebab psikologis dewasa ini tumbuh kesadaran bahwa lebih dari separuh kondisi kondisi ini berkaitan dengan penyakit penyakit fisik atau efek efek samping obat
3951344 jika anda mencurigai bahwa obat yang anda minum menyebabkan masalah masalah seksual di mana pasien sangat sering menghubungkan hal ini secara tepat sangat penting untuk mengutarakan hal tersebut kepada dokter anda
3951345 sering masalah ini menjadi ringan atau paling tidak banyak berkurang dengan memberikan obat yang berbeda kepada pasien atau mengurangi dosisnya
3951346 tidak ada garansi bahwa setelah dokter memberikan resep alternatif masalah masalah anda akan lenyap efek efek samping seksualnya belum diteliti secara luas
3951347 kadang kadang para pasien yang mencurigai bahwa sebuah obat menimbulkan masalah masalah seksual akan mengatakan
3951348 tapi ini berarti anda sedang mempertaruhkan nyawa anda sendiri jika anda tidak meminum obat obatan untuk jantung atau obat obatan untuk tekanan darah anda akan mengalami stroke atau serangan jantung dan ini satu hal yang tragis anda tidak akan meninggal namun anda juga tidak akan bahagia dan yang pasti anda tidak akan mampu melkukan aktivitas seksual

3951364 re price unfortunately he can only get a silver i spent three days covering 2007 world champion roberto cammarelle from italy and he cannot be beaten by anyone here he sparred and knocked out a professional us fighter recently in the worlds top 20
3951365 nice one pricey by dispatching the russian in the second round hell keep himself nice and fresh for the next bout could he be in with a shout for the gold
3951366 isnt david prices knockdown of islam timurziev a carbon copy of audley harrisons first match in sydney against a russian losing the fight left hander i feel a shirley bassey song coming on
3951367 never mind emma pooley i tt ed it down from the olympic sports centre cluster very 1970s to get to the last 10 minutes of the argentina v serbia footie and the south americans only went and greeted me with a large slice of goal pie i was so happy i thought id stroll across the road to see david price in action hes on next that will be 16 sports and 20 venues in just over 12 hours im going to lie down afterwards for a day and a half
3951368 this must be david price now hes fighting a russian and that blokes wearing red
3951369 hows about we start a new sport murray bashing wed have no end of people who could win a medal in that wonder if they were the same people who were championing him less than two months ago
3951370 i feel sorry for jamie murray getting knocked out i dont have the same feelings for andy i doubt even an olympic medal would put a smile on his puss
3951371 this is meant to be text commentary can you get back to reporting please
3951372 is your lunch monitor the same chris bevan that made my friend jen drink balsamic vinegar to cure her hiccups in glasgow eight years ago
3951373 re 1332 medal is not a verb you win a medal you dont medal
3951374 terrible tactical error by the british swimming coaches with that relay leave your best swimmers out at your peril the girls knew it too
3951375 what on earth were the british swim team thinking we dont have the depth of usa to allow the luxury of a b team what must the rested swimmers in the village be feeling
3951376 been to 14 sports and 16 venues but hit a dead end when i went to the water polo as i just missed the last game and there was nothing going on ive got half an hour of boxing left and one hour of football so i should get to see a bit of argentina v serbia
3951377 i imagine a helicopter would taste better than cottage cheese given that it can also fly i think that makes it a winner
3951378 re 1259 comment they are poor examples as you are comparing like with like a better example is comparing cottage cheese with a helicopter
3951379 mr dirs i think you will find kent is the garden of england and essex is its compost heap
3951380 re 1243 whos george and why is he allowed to enter people into the games
3951381 hes a strange animal that bevan used to play football with him runs like a duck
3951382 with one mistake each theres still a chance dirs or bevan could sneak a text commentary bronze being british though its more likely theyll finish fourth and fifth despite beating the british record leaving us celebrating mediocrity once again
3951383 i beat him so i feel like i can beat anybody so bring it on
3951384 see 1216 five gold medals for steve redgrave over 16 years a feat unsurpassed by any other athlete yep we sure do have a ridiculously low benchmark for our sporting heroes in britain
3951385 i note that chris bevan is your 30 minute lunchtime fill in is he on work experience what does he do for the rest of the day
3951386 why do people in our country delude themselves with theories that steve redgrave is the greatest olympian redgrave is a great olympian but he is definately not the greatest and there is quite a few ahead of him in that category our level for great achievement benchmark in this country is ridiculously low
3951387 that lead is nothing in these conditions so there is still a long way to go
3951388 can you tell me why there isnt a spare seat at the womens beach volleyball
3951389 why cant all the worlds ills be determined by two women from each protagonist playing in the sand
3951390 if every soldier in the world put down his weapon and picked up a woman what a peaceful world this world would be
3951391 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpretated as an affectionate gesture
3951392 now is the moment to enjoy and to be happy and proud that i won i am very proud to go home with two medals
3951393 re phelps trivia phelps has exactly the same number of medals as his age when he was 13 incredible
3951394 vamos rafa an olympic medal hopefully gold for nadal will make an already incredible year for him that little bit more special really hope he can pull it off he deserves it
3951395 is there some kind of comp to produce the most pointless phelps medal haul stat if so i have a contender phelps now has 13 olympic medals thats one for every letter in his name
3951396 fantastic news about the rowing hopefully the ladies can bring home the gold in the quad too
3951397 michael phelps has won more gold medals in his life than mexico has ever won in all their olympics combined and hes only 23
3951398 chinas culture and history has always been based on honour discipline and obedience us westeners find it hard to comprehend that this is also implemented within chinas sports body maybe its time for us to keep an open mind on the matter and accepting that those cultural differences instead of brandmarking it
3951399 i think you are being a bit naive if you think we can invest in sport in the same way as the chinese they are willing to sacrifice the livelihood and welfare of their people in order to excel at the olympics i dont think that is what sport should be about
3951400 if michael phelps was a country he would be fourth in the medal table
3951401 guess what another gold medal on its way for china liu chunhong has just smashed the world record in the snatch in the womens 69 kg class lifting 128 kg clean and jerk to come and she leads by a massive 13kg ioc president jacques rogge is here looking suitably impressed as he presses the flesh with assorted dignitaries
3951402 the point is that other countries should raise their game to beat china if this country realised there are more sports out there than just football and put as much money into those sports as football then great britain would be leading the medal tables
3951403 you just have to make it hurt imagine a friend sitting on your wheel shouting at you
3951404 is there any point in even trying to compete with china in anything
3951405 have you seen page 75 of todays daily mail the aussies say we brits only win in sports that involve sitting down
3951406 did you see the aussie coachs comment about brits and soap in 2012 we ought to house their athletes in wormwood scrubs
3951407 i do wish people would stop calling phelps the best olympian ever yes he is brill but steve redgrave is still the best because he won his medals consistently over twenty or more years which surely shows more stamina to keep coming back
3951408 cummings is leading the mens tt dont think we should get to excited about it though
3951409 i raced as well as i could theres no secret you just have to make it hurt imagine a friend sitting on your wheel shouting at you
3951410 no you just have to ride like you never have to breathe again
3951411 can you tell me at what distance are the archers shooting at
3951412 it has been a morning of smashing what i thought were unbreakable records britain are progressing all the time but so are the rest of the world
3951413 phelps amp spitz both getting the medals in swimming does suggest that its easier to get multiple medals in the sport as to the greatest given that their medals included the premier medals of all the 100m jessie owens and carl lewis have to be up there
3951414 michael phelps brilliant at what he does greatest olympian no sir steve redgrave brilliant olympian yes greatest ever no daley thompson the best olympian ever thompson excelled in 10 different events whereas the above only excelled in their own specialized event not only that but he did it twice who could possibly claim a greater achievement
3951415 with phelps only at the age of 23 surely the best is yet to come from him when phelps does hit his peak hell be even more unstoppable than he is now a very scary thought
3951416 if phelps does get 8 golds in this olympics i dont think there will be any argument against him being the best ever olympian
3951417 phelps greatest olympian ever although he has won more golds than anyone else not many sports allow you to win more than 1 can you not say redgrave is better as he won over more olympics which is harder to keep it at the elite level for so long
3951418 has the pool water been mixed with energy tablets these performances are out of this world well done to all performers
3951419 what a race from bernard fantastic time from the frenchman
3951420 i cannot take this responsibility please let me do anything else ill fetch coffee ill make photocopies
3951421 we previously had terms they had to be renegotiated until they were renegotiated the deal wasnt going to go forward
3951422 although i was not conscious at the time that my actions were improper upon further review and reflection i believe that i did in fact err in certain respects
3951423 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
3951424 and received assurances from president medvedev that russia would uphold its commitments
3951425 we saw looting with our own eyes they were taking household items loading electric heaters bicycles and carpets
3951426 ive played it since i was 5 but now ive lost interest
3951427 ping pong became a popular national sport because of politics
3951428 but nowadays i think even pool is more popular than ping pong
3951429 i am now recognising in both the one dayers and the tests i am one of the more senior players and that i need to go out and play like that
3951430 its an exciting thing for me to be seen as one of the senior players and to go out there and have a responsibility to deliver its a role im looking forward to having for a while to try to lead by example
3951431 its something i want to do as i have played enough test matches i have made a switch in the batting order from five to three and there is an opportunity to cement my place
3951432 it has been like that in the one dayers for a while and it is something i have enjoyed and i have been able to be very vocal in team meetings
3951433 hopefully it will be the same in the test matches and my performances against south africa the form team in world cricket show i have improved this summer i am desperate for that to continue
3951434 the ability is in the dressing room to win the ashes i dont think anyone would doubt that
3951435 the one thing we need to do as a side which we havent done too well is to be consistent
3951436 we scored almost 600 at lords and then followed that up by scoring 200 twice in the first innings of the next two tests
3951437 mental health and psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents globally have received little research attention even though mental health problems are one of the most significant contributors to the global burden of disease
3951438 little is known about the efficacy of mental health interventions for children exposed to armed conflicts in low and middle income settings childhood mental health problems are difficult to address in situations of ongoing poverty and political instability
3951439 no changes were found on the other outcome variables traumatic idioms depressive anxiety symptoms and functioning the latter for boys
3951440 we hypothesize that these results may show that psychosocial interventions alone are unable to reverse the challenges to psychosocial well being presented by chronic poverty and political instability
3951441 in short a school based psychosocial intervention was able to moderately reduce ptsd symptoms retain hope and improve functioning for girls and retain hope for boys affected by communal violence in a low income context
3951442 further adaptations and research to address the full range of post traumatic outcomes and functioning are necessary
3951443 this is a serious condition because it can go on to cause a lot of major joint damaged and destruction
3951444 this will help to reduce some of the swelling and decrease some of the pain associated with that swelling
3951445 kashmiris will continue to agitate peacefully and we should not give indian oppressors any chance to use brute force
3951446 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3951447 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3951448 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3951449 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3951450 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home

3951458 repudiamos esos actos criminales y le exigimos al fiscal de distrito jaime sol s que esclarezca estos hechos que ofende a la nobleza de nuestro pueblo de humildad de hermandad con nuestros pueblos latinoamericanos

3951464 were very hopeful hell make it in time for dortmund
3951465 luca needs some more time we dont want him coming back too soon and then picking up another injury two weeks later
3951466 they are two completely different games that cannot be compared to each other
3951467 it is always good to start a season with a victory but we know full well what we have to do
3951468 this would be my first ever post to this site
3951469 the body doesnt look exactly like people thought it would because the has been the model in our minds however this looks as if it is an actual apelike primate indeed the gorilla like facial features the robust lack of canines and the grinding surfaces shown in the teeth suggest a bulky vegetarian with a mixture of higher primate characteristics every alternative must be explored including comparing it to known costumes could it be an elaborate hoax more physical examinations of the body must take place
3951470 not definite yet but is one of the people they are seriously looking at
3951471 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3951472 his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him
3951473 bigfoot seekers including a redwood city man who released a documentary titled
3951474 i think youll find that this is the real deal barrows said of the alleged discovery
3951475 boy buggering in both islam and catholicism is okay with the pope as long as it isnt reported by the liberal press
3951476 ragheads are boy bumpers as clearly as they are women haters it all goes together
3951477 after he married terrahsa didnt john kerry begin practicing judiasm he also has paternal grandparents that were jewish what religion is john kerry
3951478 anybody ask why hellary couldnt keep bj bill satisfied not lesbo or anything is she
3951479 it doesnt matter if my suppoting facts are wrong my thesis stands on its own absurdity
3951480 one must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star
3951481 the legislators of mauritania support the change that occurred in the interest of the mauritanian people
3951482 we regret that all of the attempts made by members of parliament and other well intentioned people failed to lessen the stubbornness of the former president who did not listen to his constituents
3951483 i think this is an argument the coup leaders are making to justify themselves and what they did but it doesnt conform to reality
3951484 we see it as more students who will eventually have access to institutions
3951485 i have a zero threshold for insignificant facts i will cut people off if they dont answer my question
3951486 being a state senator where i have a forum to criticize him
3951487 when youre down there at the capitol every day and youre frustrated sure you think about it
3951488 now im home with my wife and kids and my frustration level isnt pegging out at 110 percent
3951489 i lose my temper i cuss im prideful im arrogant i can name 50 sins i commit everyday i wish sometimes i could be more humble i really do
3951490 we lost a very important symbol of our nationalism and our cultural heritage
3951491 o mahmoud o darwish in our hearts you will live
3951492 liberated the old arabic poetry from its constraints and made it accessible to a big audience
3951493 that channel that shows crappy chopped up prints of 70s movies
3951494 providing educational and professional development opportunities helps companies attract top performers maximize productivity and boost retention efforts
3951495 employees who take full advantage of the resources available for learning remain intellectually challenged and increase their ability to take on greater responsibility at work
3951496 interpersonal skills are vital as the workplace becomes increasingly collaborative
3951497 classes that offer instruction on how to communicate more effectively can be especially useful for career advancement
3951498 in an uncertain economy people grow more concerned about job security and proving their worth to employers
3951499 this pressure to perform may result in rivalries between employees
3951500 a bit of healthy competition among staff can increase motivation and productivity but just as in sports the overall results of the team are what count too much intramural competition creates tension and stands in the way of collaboration
3951501 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3951502 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3951503 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3951504 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3951505 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3951506 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3951507 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3951508 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3951509 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3951510 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3951511 i am announcing that i am separated from lisaraye mccoy misick
3951512 i am committed to dissolving the marriage amicably i believe that this is a private matter and will have no further comments i hope that our privacy will be respected
3951513 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3951514 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3951515 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3951516 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3951517 i would love them unconditionally if they wanted to but i would just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3951518 i was shocked a little bit shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling but im sure my boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3951519 god has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something if this hadnt happened i would never have been able to get back with my daughter and have this relationship i have with these two little boys
3951520 i found this fellow in on a mushy slimy rotting mushroom near a small pond or seasonal pool in mixed woods
3951521 there are way too many milk snakes and black snakes in the walls to make visitor
3951522 the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry
3951523 the right to transfer for all classroom teachers executives and principals
3951524 schools out west will simply not attract enough candidates or quality candidates
3951525 hydrogen does but its not stable biodiesel is not consistent and with gas you really have to build boats to suit and its not safe
3951526 lpg becomes an issue as fumes sink and hang and become very volatile
3951527 solar and hydro can be used to look after bits and pieces like domestic power but not to propel the boat
3951528 natural gas vaporises into the air but you dont get enough oomph out of it
3951529 for a trawler with the capacity for 25 000 litres of diesel to convert to gas would see the equivalent capacity of 5 000 litres
3951530 all this climate change stuff will force it to happen
3951531 we are really grateful he could do so many loads today
3951532 the success of these skips is phenomenal and everybody is so happy to have this opportunity
3951533 when we first walked though it was a garbage dump and now its like natural bushland except for some cars which are quite an eyesore
3951534 we are going to try to get council to do a kerb side pickup once or twice a year like they do in the cities
3951535 well also be asking for bins at the bus stop in west street and bank street
3951536 without vera and her tenants group committee we wouldnt be doing it
3951537 were pretty chuffed that theyre being filled up so quickly
3951538 i felt absolutely privileged to receive the award it was a wonderful experience
3951539 i didnt know the ceremony would be just for me you assume that if something is organised at government house then all the people receiving the award would be there her excellency is a pretty busy lady
3951540 it was an honour to meet and talk with mrs bashir she was really nice and very down to earth
3951541 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
3951542 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
3951543 aku menyayangi keluarga ronson mereka sangat dekat di hatiku dan aku sangat menghargai apa yang telah mereka lakukan buatku hubunganku dengan samantha adalah masalah pribadi
3951544 itu adalah langkah awal dari sebuah perkencanan ia ibarat seorang anak kecil yang tengah dilanda cinta monyet
3951545 aku tak pernah berkirim pesan maupun email pada senator obama dan aku menawarkan jutaan dolar bagi siapa saja yang bisa memberi bukti soal kabar miring tersebut
3951546 dia juga muslim yang baik tapi soal jodoh tuhan yang ngatur
3951547 pastinya perempuan dan muslim yang bisa menjalankan islam dengan baik untuk itu kita wajib memilih namun bukan berarti pilih pilih
3951548 there certainly was a definite cockiness that democrats felt once they regained control of congress and ive also felt it was a misplaced cockiness
3951549 youve got a lot of conditions that are similar to 1932 and similar to 1980 a very unpopular president and the party brand badly hurt
3951550 but we wont know if its going to happen until late
3951551 i dont think you see leads in presidential races over 5 points in this day and age hes averaged leads of 3 points since spring the key is that obama hasnt closed the sale
3951552 it wasnt until reagan reached the threshold that he was able to close the sale
3951553 there is something about obama that is causing something of drag
3951554 this may sound kind of harsh but if the democratic nominee were a white male from a red or purple state the theory would be dead on that this would be set up there would be a very very high probability for a democratic landslide
3951555 youve never had a young guy win by such a large margin post war
3951556 as always he is holding his cards close and waiting for more information
3951557 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
3951558 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
3951559 i have voted for members of both parties in the course of my adult life and as i said earlier i will vote for the candidate i think can do the best job for america whether that candidate is a republican a democrat or an independent
3951560 he has energized a lot of people around the world and so i think he is worth listening to and seeing what he stands for
3951561 he likes and admires john mccain and that would be a factor in anything he does if he decides to get more involved
3951562 and likes him and is looking for a reason to vote for him he hasnt found it yet
3951563 i will ultimately vote for the person i believe brings to the american people the kind of vision the american people want to see for the next four years
3951564 a vision that reaches out to the rest of the world that starts to restore confidence in america that starts to restore favorable ratings to america frankly weve lost a lot in recent years
3951565 signal that choice sends about the character and judgment of the candidate
3951566 jag vill ha kvar herrfotboll i os under 2000 talet har turneringarna ofta varit lysande ett f r vm med ppnare spel
3951567 j mf rt med sin namne sk despelaren r den 26 rige australiern brad pitt n got tyngre och har ett mer rrat ansikte
3951568 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
3951569 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3951570 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
3951571 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3951572 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3951573 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
3951574 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
3951575 he controlled what they ate what they did he controlled pretty much everything
3951576 i asked did you go to help and they looked at me like it was the strangest question dad pretty much did whatever he wanted to do
3951577 the victims of this type of abuse theyre made to believe theyre not worthy of anything that this is what they deserve
3951578 its amazing they were not allowed outside they were simply not allowed to go near the door it all goes back to the control thing
3951579 i think its just hitting her what she is going through
3951580 theyre going through all that as a team trying to figure out if favre or aaron rodgers was the man while weve got the same team we had all offseason im glad they got all that darn press cause when we go down there itll be the kids first start and his first damn loss
3951581 but they don t understand that brett made those guys better than they were he has the game all figured out and you ve got to factor all that into the equation brett favre would throw the ball when the receivers hadnt even made their cut yet and it would be there waiting for them those guys had it good people think its the system but it aint no damn system brett favre just knows where his guys are going to be at all times and i dont think aaron rodgers has got that yet
3951582 one thing ive noticed while picking through the depressingly long list of botched drug raids the cops always shoot the dog
3951583 jen i love you your always crazy and interesting your so intelligent and no matter how you feel that your life has changed and taken a different path than you may have originally planned for i know in the end your gonna be great and successful in everything that you do cant wait to see what happens
3951584 this program has operated under the radar without accountability criteria application standards or even an application form for far too long
3951585 the bill i will introduce in september and the proposed resolution sr 61 will help to prevent these abuses in the future
3951586 this program has been used as a secret slush fund for the benefit of a few politically favored cities
3951587 this practice has to stop state aid must be awarded equitably whether through the special municipal aid program rural policing education aid or regular municipal aid given our current financial circumstances this is no time to play favorites
3951588 muhammad ali made in miami explores the critical role that miami played in the evolution of one of the most significant cultural figures of our time muhammad ali ne cassius clay the film chronicles cassius clays arrival in miami in the fall of 1960 fresh from earning a gold medal in the rome olympics his life in overtown a neighborhood that was considered harlem south and a vibrant center of black entertainment and commerce and his affiliation with the famed fifth street gym in miami beach over the course of the next few years coinciding with the height of the national civil rights movement clay evolved both professionally and politically piling up victories in the ring and adopting the black separatist teachings of the nation of islam as muhammad ali made in miami makes clear it was in this period that cassius clay became muhammad ali
3951589 this is very bare bones and very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
3951590 you showed the sign where it said stun gun in use and you just change the word gun for bolt and its a meat processing plant
3951591 were going to have the community and the media come out and view the place
3951592 to take a cheap shot at me as if helping a struggling democracy is somehow wrong
3951593 at all sort of critical moments when there have been repeated russian provocations randy was a calming influence

3951596 o sovereign lord must i be defiled by using human dung for i have never been defiled before from the time i was a child until now i have never eaten any animal that died of sickness or that i found dead and i have never eaten any of the animals that our laws forbid
3951597 you may bake your bread with cow dung instead of human dung
3951598 smoke smoke smoke that cigarette was a 1 hit on billboard for six weeks in 1947 and was the first million seller for capitol records

3951611 the retailer will make its largest investment yet in the country since it started operating in brazil fourteen years ago

3951614 be able to take his growing pains out on the local fairy tale inhabitants as he protects his castle and lands
3951615 my positions on handling sex crimes have always been influenced by input from the attorney general and states attorneys and i want to make sure we provide them with the tools they need thats why im endorsing their recommendations on special investigative units expanding use of dna tests for identification and admitting prior sexual misconduct in court proceedings
3951616 im particularly pleased that these law enforcement leaders joined my call for full staffing of special investigative units they have proven to be very effective at helping to obtain convictions and longer sentences vermonters are still waiting for an answer from governor douglas on why state troopers have not been transferred into these critically important units
3951617 because of the severe consequences that can result from early release of sex offenders this extra layer of deliberation and justification is appropriate
3951618 prevent child abuse vermont has already been targeted for cuts several times by the douglas administration so im concerned it will be attacked again it is an important program and we must not let that happen i also believe other sex abuse prevention programs should be held harmless in the budget process
3951619 these are important steps we need to take to strengthen our approach to preventing and prosecuting sex crimes i am open to making other changes and look forward to the recommendations that will be made at the end of the senate judiciary committee hearings
3951620 israels services in central america have been considerable including nicaragua under somoza guatemala el salvador and honduras and now apparently costa rica since it began to draw closer to u s policy in the region
3951621 israel has found itself in an awkward position as a result of its arms sales to georgia
3951622 israel is now caught between its friendly relations with georgia and its fear that the continued sale of weaponry will spark russian retribution in the form of increased arms sales to iran and syria
3951623 rather than acting as a neutral peacekeeper russia has escalated the hostilities through its attacks on georgian towns and cities outside the conflict zone
3951624 canada calls on russia to respect georgias borders and to desist from any further encroachment on georgias territorial integrity
3951625 it was georgian military forces that started all this on friday with a predawn attack on south ossetia wasnt it and didnt south ossetia win de facto independence in a civil war from georgia 16 years ago
3951626 the international red cross is reporting that about half of south ossetias 70 000 population has fled the georgian military assault so why isnt mr emerson condemning the georgian government
3951627 somebodys gotta win and somebodys gotta lose and i believe in letting the other guy lose
3951628 many struggling gays and lesbians will find this blog an inspiration

3951639 political domination and economic centralization has characterized the current arrangement in nigeria since 1966
3951640 every nigerian has a stake in the survival and prosperity of this country this stake should be recognized no section or group should be made to feel disenfranchised or alienated the obstacles to voluntary and enthusiastic identification with nigerians should be removed i believe this can be achieved through open dialogue among the constituents of the nigerian federation
3951641 the sovereign national conference will give the ethnic nationalities an opportunity to examine the questions that have made nigeria such a disaster and come up with some answers such as the right of every nationality to have greater control over their resources
3951642 hes the leader of our offense and hes looking very sharp in practice

3951678 in approximately 17 countries around the world children are direct participants in war denied a childhood and often subjected to horrific violence many thousands of children are serving as soldiers for both rebel groups and government forces in current armed conflicts these young combatants participate in all aspects of contemporary warfare they wield ak 47s and m 16s on the front lines of combat serve as human mine detectors participate in suicide missions carry supplies and act as spies messengers or lookouts physically vulnerable and easily intimidated children typically make obedient soldiers many are abducted or recruited by force and often compelled to follow orders under threat of death others join armed groups out of desperation as society breaks down during conflict leaving children no access to school driving them from their homes or separating them from family members many children perceive armed groups as their best chance for survival others seek escape from poverty or join military forces to avenge family members who have been killed
3951679 the fop stepped up and said were all brothers in blue the city needs help lets help our brothers too well all chip in the same amount of money all for one one for all
3951680 even if their off duty their not off duty if they are in that police car they are required to have their radio and their gun with them at all times and they are sworn to uphold the law no matter where they are in the state of indiana
3951681 i would think that other police departments would take a look at what the lawrence police have done i think our public safety heroes have stepped up to the plate and i hope they will follow
3951682 you have a suspicious substance that was found in a hotel room in conjunction with a person being a foreign national and we have a lot of questions and that is why we are assisting
3951683 there is not necessarily more of a concern but it is something we are aware of and how close the dnc is
3951684 we want to make sure we do everything we can to find out the unknown
3951685 it depends on do you breathe it in does it get on your skin that makes all the difference in the world sitting in a bag it does nothing but if you get it on your skin itll go through the pores of your skin and kill you
3951686 i can tell you that recent developments between russia and georgia give us no proof that dmitry medvedev is an independent leader
3951687 one scene was very clear when putin began to tell the president what to do it was not a private conversation putin wanted to show that he was in charge
3951688 no one thought about a session of duma no one even bothered
3951689 because that company you were going to invest in went bankrupt you would have lost everything
3951690 im going out of town and i have some groceries that i dont want to spoil
3951691 what slam poets am i into yeah check out james mccoy hes great
3951692 i was hanging around my dad doing nothing not convinced about the huge line of films he was committed to the one song one fight format is something beyond my understanding i was very sure about doing something in entertainment one day i want to open a different gate to the audience
3951693 i think global but im essentially a local i want to divert peoples attention to local tv and show that a telugu television could be like this also
3951694 it will be 60 entertainment and 40 news there will be plenty of reality shows talk shows film based programmes but absolutely no serials my reality shows will not be harsh it will only encourage not demoralize a participant
3951695 unique coupons and offers sent by mobile text messaging not only deliver instant gratification but also are one of the greenest avenues to reach potential shoppers
3951696 this effort is recognition that the military community is shifting away from traditional paper coupons and responding to digital content
3951697 she wrote that her life became an ordeal after her family members grew suspicious about her after a religious discussion with them she said that her brother found some christian articles written by her as well as a cross sign on her computer screen since then he started to insult her and blamed the internet for pushing her to change her religion
3951698 we have crews engaged to deliver supplies to those in need and others on standby ready to go at a moments notice if called upon to go in and provide relief
3951699 weve been called on to provide relief before air mobility is a unique asset for our nation
3951700 our airlift capability also allowed our nation to keep its promise to georgia
3951701 general schwartz and i have several issues to address together the nuclear enterprise of course care for our wounded warriors our intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance posture the acquisition process modernization and recapitalization and of course continued support for the global war on terror
3951702 my pledge to all today is that the air force will keep the promise to our teammates our families and to all our partners who rely on us everyday
3951703 precision and reliability is our standard regardless of job or specialty and we will return the vigor and rigor to all the processes and missions for which we have been entrusted
3951704 we will train organize and inspect to that standard the bottom line
3951705 we have a lot of work to do but we have a lot to be proud of as well
3951706 in those areas where others have found fault we are going to work with a vengeance and we will remain the worlds finest air force
3951707 obviously not getting through the tanker protest was a major blow to our acquisition process so i supported the defense secretarys decision to move the next steps in that source selection process over from the air force to the office of the secretary of defense
3951708 i wont be satisfied until we get through these major source selections and potential protests that may follow with a clean bill of health
3951709 we are looking at the new level that the secretary of defense had set the main thing for us is not the number but obviously the mix in terms of what new missions and requirements need to be covered in that 330 000
3951710 we are going to put 14 000 or so difference where we need them most
3951711 the cyber mission is important and it will go forward for the air force
3951712 the issue is in what context form and national framework this is not just about the air force it has to fit with strategic command and the broader national security community and were going to make sure all those pieces fit together as we proceed
3951713 we want to make sure we remain in the role of consumer and not perceived by others as a producer the air force is fundamentally a consumer of energy
3951714 if were going to be involved with this cooperative work going forward were going to make sure were in partnership with the department of energy and other federal agencies that need to be involved
3951715 our sole goal is to safely and rapidly deliver humanitarian aid to georgia to alleviate human suffering and save lives
3951716 we will continue to support this humanitarian mission until the host nation and the u s state department determine that it is no longer needed
3951717 thank you so much for helping us in this great time of need these supplies will surely save lives
3951718 we are very pleased that the joint military community eucom u s army europe and u s air forces in europe have the opportunity to provide logistical support to bring these humanitarian supplies here
3951719 eucom forces will remain ready to support as further needs are assessed
3951720 receiving reaccreditation further solidifies the air forces museum as one of national prominence and prestige
3951721 the commitment of the board staff volunteers and foundation to uphold the highest standards of the museum practice is shown with this award
3951722 this is a great example of the capability to let our airmen submit their forms and have a systematic visibility on their status throughout the chain of command
3951723 commanders could have reports in coordination without knowing their status
3951724 now guard and reserve commanders can know exactly where all their reports are by looking on vpc gr
3951725 we wanted to create a system where any of our customers could log in and request any service we provide at their convenience from anywhere in the world
3951726 then we could get back to them with a response within a reasonable timeframe
3951727 the 20 year and mortgage letters process was our first process that didnt require anyone to do anything on the back end the computer did all the work for us
3951728 these letters are examples of tier 0 service at its finest
3951729 the customer knows what he wants and the computer automatically gives it to him
3951730 with where we are around the world in many different and varied areas giving our members access is crucial so they know and have a comfortable feeling that their records are right
3951731 personnel services delivery transformation is helping us keep pace in line with the ops tempo of todays world and how we deploy around the world
3951732 as developers we have total control over vpc gr applications and our case management system
3951733 if an urgent change is needed based on customer feedback mandated changes or to fix a problem we have the local talent and flexibility to make these changes quickly
3951734 very few programs meet all of their customers needs when they first hit the street well be prepared to provide development support for customer processes during the transition to dimhrs and migration to the new consolidated case management system
3951735 all of the online applications were creating are helping us get comfortable with using online transactions which will continue to increase as the military transitions to dihmrs
3951736 we want to make is as easy as possible for our customers
3951737 as we receive feedback from the field we evaluate it to see if there is anything we can do to make it easier for our customers as a whole
3951738 i saw mountains in my case oceans sky and air that dwarfed nuclear weapons and the life and death they seemed to threaten i breathed deeply the world began to realign itself more generously or rather my vision did none of this was logical none of it made sense
3951739 the injury is to a weight bearing part of the foot and the doctors say that using too much pressure on the pegs could very easily give me some big problems
3951740 i went to dr ting and got the opinion of other specialists ive done a lot with ting he knows the sport very well and he feels it would be quite risky to ride he and the other specialists say that if i rode this week i might have to fight the injury for the rest of the year as hard a decision as it is and as bad as i feel about it i think im better off staying home doing rehab and physio then come back fit at misano and try to finish the season strong theres been a lot of guys this year trying to ride less than a hundred per cent and actually making their problems worse i certainly feel bad about it
3951741 i had the permission of hrc to do the supermoto thing i just wanted to do some riding during the break have some fun and i thought that maybe itd give me a little spark for the rest of the season but it backfired on me
3951742 im feeling pretty good now and im anxious to get back on track
3951743 ive now got full movement back in the injured knee and its been fine during my training regime up to now i dont think its going to cause me any problems on the bike but its been almost seven weeks since ive thrown a leg over the ninja zx rr so i wont know for sure until we start free practice on friday
3951744 i have had a good break and am now ready to get back into the saddle and start riding again
3951745 we finished the first half of the season with good rewards from our efforts and i am sure we can continue that momentum at brno
3951746 brno is a circuit that i like a lot its one of my favorites
3951747 when i returned from laguna seca my doctor told me i needed a week and a half of complete rest
3951748 i couldnt train so i spent an enjoyable few days in mallorca disconnecting from everything and resting both my hand and foot i started training last week mostly on my bicycle i hope i can have a good race at brno to start the second part of the championship in the best possible way
3951749 weve still got quite a few points to make up in the championship which wont be easy but the whole team are working so hard and well give it our best shot after that whatever will be will be after the race at laguna seca i went back to australia and spent a bit of time with my wife and family away from the track i got some rest in but i also trained hard and now i cant wait to get back on the bike
3951750 there can be no assurance that the kftc will approve the possible transaction that an agreement will be reached or that a transaction will occur
3951751 i walked over and found a disaster bodies on the ground some mangled some wounded it was awful
3951752 there was an old man selling coffee and just as i asked him for a cup the bomb went off and we all hit the floor
3951753 as always he is holding his cards close and waiting for more information
3951754 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
3951755 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
3951756 i have voted for members of both parties in the course of my adult life and as i said earlier i will vote for the candidate i think can do the best job for america whether that candidate is a republican a democrat or an independent
3951757 he has energized a lot of people around the world and so i think he is worth listening to and seeing what he stands for
3951758 he likes and admires john mccain and that would be a factor in anything he does if he decides to get more involved
3951759 and likes him and is looking for a reason to vote for him he hasnt found it yet
3951760 i will ultimately vote for the person i believe brings to the american people the kind of vision the american people want to see for the next four years
3951761 a vision that reaches out to the rest of the world that starts to restore confidence in america that starts to restore favorable ratings to america frankly weve lost a lot in recent years
3951762 signal that choice sends about the character and judgment of the candidate
3951763 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
3951764 being a state senator where i have a forum to criticize him
3951765 when youre down there at the capitol every day and youre frustrated sure you think about it
3951766 now im home with my wife and kids and my frustration level isnt pegging out at 110 percent
3951767 he did real well he was able to put a different hat on
3951768 senseless act of depraved violence that touches all of us
3951769 he was a very effective leader for his party and an event like this certainly makes all politics seem small and insignificant
3951770 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
3951771 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney along with thousands of other arkansans ginger and i are trying to come to terms with such a shocking and senseless attack
3951772 they are staying there to neutralize the large arsenal of weapons and other military hardware in the areas of gori and senaki these arsenals remain unguarded apparently those who guarded them fled
3951773 aimed at ensuring the peace enforcement operation in respect to the georgian side which violates all of its obligations
3951774 russian tanks continue to ravage georgia town and villages killing people destroying buildings looting theyve been doing worse things to what ive heard in the past and i could never imagine happening in my country
3951775 we as the russian federation are sticking to the agreement which has been made in moscow yesterday and we hope that the other side will show its readiness to do the same
3951776 blaming again us for doing something which is contrary to the real situation
3951777 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know they had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
3951778 there is no cease fire russian forces are moving around
3951779 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
3951780 i still say thats the best thing that happened to me
3951781 i got to go home and spend time with my father who was fighting unfortunately a losing battle with cancer
3951782 i still remember myself as a five foot tall kid in high school with a back brace on
3951783 i had a bunch of girl friends but no actual girlfriends
3951784 on the court makes a difference in my life but when i can use that to help others it makes my job seem much more meaningful
3951785 recently you may want to check out my hot photos there
3951786 calls have been pouring in from all over the country this is a very sad day
3951787 it just makes you aware of how precious life is you never know what the day may bring
3951788 the matter with mayor kilpatrick is dragging down the business and the hopes of the city
3951789 independent filmmakers in need of finances to complete feature length documentaries that promote social change and illuminate issues in need of comprehensive coverage currently missing from mainstream media
3951790 all of the selected films are distinguished by their intimate access to their subjects and the attention to detail being shown in crafting their stories
3951791 its a terrific group and we are delighted to welcome these filmmakers into the tribeca fold
3951792 be able to take his growing pains out on the local fairy tale inhabitants as he protects his castle and lands
3951793 the apollo moon shot and the human genome project rallied support for massive r amp d efforts that created the capabilities to overcome obstacles that were not contemplated at the outset of these initiatives
3951794 similarly todays barriers to improving biofuels are significant but genetics and genomics can catalyze progress towards delivering in the not too distant future economically viable and more socially acceptable biofuels based on lignocellulose
3951795 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3951796 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3951797 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3951798 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3951799 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3951800 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
3951801 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
3951802 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3951803 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3951804 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3951805 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3951806 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3951807 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
3951808 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else
3951809 do you understand whether time goes forwards or backwards here
3951810 once upon a time there were two brothers ramzes and ramzo ramzes went to egypt and ramzo stayed in visoko
3951811 frankly i think thats disgusting honestly theyre seven and nine years old so young
3951812 i find it sad that they ruined an otherwise pretty awesome ceremony with those fakes
3951813 so forget beijing 2008 best opening ceremony so far is still sydney 2000 they didnt see it necessary to use computer generated images to impress the world
3951814 apparently the little girl whose voice was used yang peiyi wasnt cute enough it was deemed bad for chinas image to show a little girl with crooked teeth
3951815 something about passing over a child for crooked teeth just seems well wrong
3951816 china wants the olympics as a stage to present a picture perfect image to the outside world and perfection was clearly the goal for the dazzling opening ceremonies
3951817 eager to put on a perfect olympics beijing has swept its streets of fake designer handbags pirated
3951818 the song was pre recorded the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
3951819 i just have to go out there and show everybody what i can do its my last year
3951820 its my first year starting at running back for the tigers
3951821 im just going to have to go out there and show everybody what i can do

3951824 i know people are going to give me their best shot because they know im going to michigan
3951825 theyre just going to come at me i just have to keep my cool and just go out there and show what i can do
3951826 ive gotten used to it for over a year now so i think thats going to be big
3951827 theyre talking about starting if i go up there and do what ive got to do everything should just fall into place
3951828 i just have to take every game step by step
3951829 its just one game at a time and go out there and try to help us win every game
3951830 a big budget should mean the film will look a lot better than some of the old movies

3951836 i would rather be remembered by a song than by a victory
3951837 lelaki secara umum lebih besar dan lebih tinggi daripada perempuan suara lelaki dan telapak tangannya kasar berbeda dengan suara dan telapak tangannya perempuan pertumbuhan perempuan lebih cepat dari lelaki tetapi perempuan lebih mampu membentengi diri dari penyakit dibanding lelaki dan lebih cepat bicaranya bahkan lebih dewasa dari lelaki rata rata bentuk kepala lelaki lebih besar dari kepala perempuan tetapi jika dibandingkan dari segi bentuk tubuhnya maka sebenarnya perempuan lebih besar kemampuan paru paru lelaki menghirup udara lebih besar banyak daripada perempuan dan denyut jantung perempuan lebih cepat daripada lelaki

3951839 every person has the right to express and propagate his opinion verbally in writing or otherwise in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified by law
3951840 freedom of the press printing and publishing is guaranteed in accordance with the conditions and manner specified by law
3951841 this law is a way to control what bloggers publish online the government wants to know who is this blogger they want us to shut up so they are free to do anything they want they cant handle the truth
3951842 if i put a comment at 2 03 09 a m the government can call all isps here in kuwait and ask for all ips running at that time this is more of a safety tip for the commenter than for the blogger a scheduled publishing system is a way to protect the blogger for example if at 8 00 p m i am at the cinema and i have a ticket and at 8 10 p m blogger com publishes my post nobody can prove that i published the post
3951843 they cant control what bloggers write unlike the newspapers or tv stations which are controlled by laws and have financial ties that cant be cut
3951844 what is illegal in one country is not illegal in another
3951845 such a law is needed to combat the increasing electronic crimes associated with the ever improving electronic technology
3951846 those of you who want this communion centralised can have it so but we say no thanks and meanwhile the pastoral forum has no authority
3951847 found in brooklyn ny on july 3rd on 5th avenue across from gorilla coffee in park slope prospect heights area was the card dropped trashed for a new one or did someone find the camera and toss the card

3951849 our advice to anybody who has ever wondered is to never ask permission
3951850 today was done covertly 25 years ago by the cia
3951851 at the outbreak of violence russia had tried to have the united nations security council issue a statement calling on georgia and south ossetia to immediately lay down weapons however washington was disinterested
3951852 the war in georgia is a war for the west
3951853 this is not about georgia any more it is about america its values
3951854 urgent event russian georgian war a challenge for the u s and the world
3951855 seem happy to work together to weaken the influence of the united states and its democratic allies
3951856 significant long term impact on relations between washington and moscow
3951857 so why dont you shut up oh and by the way send some more of your military advisors to georgia they are doing a sterling job and they look all funny down the night sight all green
3951858 we want littlebigplanet to lead the charge into a new genre of gaming and turn sackboy into the next emblematic character for the ps3

3951861 anders was ik kansloos tegen de vrouwen die veel dikkere en sterkere armen hebben
3951862 al is dat een pak moeilijker dan een medaille te halen
3951863 voor deze spelen heb ik speciaal een psycholoog onder de arm genomen
3951864 ik heb nog geen slechte ervaring met eten gehad hier ik kijk altijd goed of het er lekker uitziet en hoop dan maar dat het geen hond of aap is
3951865 ik heb al in regen hagel en sneeuw getraind dus dit zonnetje doet me goed alles wat we op het water doen is ingestudeerd al is het allerbelangrijkste dat je de windrichting goed kan lezen
3951866 dat ik me kon kwalificeren voor peking was al een droom op zich

3951868 el racing no est en liquidaci n y la venta de duscher ha sido muy ventajosa
3951869 total falta de lectura de los resultados del referendo revocatorio del 10 de agosto que ha expresado en el presidente y vicepresidente de la rep blica el sentimiento de unidad nacional
3951870 el vicepresidente ha expresado su decepci n y su frustraci n porque mientras prefectos vienen a dialogar surge esos ardiles que vienen a reiterar sta actitud soberbia rabiosa del prefecto rub n costas que no se present en la reuni n pretextando estar mal de salud pero con su haz bajo la manga acaba de emitir sta resoluci n ilegal e inconstitucional

3951875 con mucha fortuna las bombas no han llegado a explosionar y no hemos tenido que lamentar por suerte desgracias de ninguna naturaleza el mensaje que al parecer intentan dar a nuestra instituci n es que est n vigil ndonos
3951876 nuestra instituci n tiene la nica finalidad de trabajar por los derechos de las organizaciones ind genas campesinas y colonizadores consideramos que por esto hemos sido agredidos la tarde este mi rcoles presumimos que son peque os grupos fascistas que existen en santa cruz los responsable de esto
3951877 el crecimiento exponencial se debe a la connivencia de la pol tica
3951878 no me pueden decir que el gobierno previene la droga cuando no se toman pol ticas en materia de radarizaci n y en precursores qu micos
3951879 hay incluso rutas liberadas para que entre la droga que entra por salta y sigue por la ruta 34
3951880 por qu no averiguan lo que pasa en quilmes con la droga
3951881 consecuencias en la seguridad y se mantiene en la actualidad
3951882 hay que combatir muy fuertemente esta situaci n y esto no lo puede hacer solo el gobierno de la provincia de buenos aires el ministro de seguridad carlos stornelli no tiene responsabilidad en lo que est ocurriendo lo que hace falta es una decisi n a nivel del gobierno nacional de combatir de una vez la droga en la argentina

3951885 he mendis is a bit different and the batsmen need some time to settle in we have to be positive but ultimately it comes down to how we play him in the middle
3951886 its tough to say anything right now but we know what he have to do we know our abilities and are quite confident
3951887 after a long time we have two match winning spinners we now have more attacking options
3951888 murali has now got the support he needs and there is also support for vaas its quite a relief for a captain to have such an option in mendis for us it is always a team game
3951889 the us has for several years now mishandled the situation in georgia
3951890 the way that mikheil saakashvili has approached this has been by thinking that he could be an extension of the west a partner of the united states
3951891 in many ways we have given him cause for thinking that with the many visits to the united states the talk of georgia as a beacon for democracy
3951892 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
3951893 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
3951894 underlying all this is a larger more significant contest a geopolitical struggle between russia and the west over the export of caspian sea oil and natural gas
3951895 the united states seeks to use georgia as an energy corridor to transport caspian energy to the west without going through iran or russia to this end it helped build the btc pipeline across georgia and helped beef up the georgian military to protect it
3951896 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
3951897 the kremlin made abundantly clear that it would view kosovos independence without serbian consent and a un security council mandate as a precedent for the two georgian de facto independent enclaves
3951898 we have developed our sound without changing too much we dont want to upset our fans
3951899 where does money come from where does it go who makes it the money magicians secrets are unveiled here is a close look at their mirrors and smoke machines the pulleys cogs and wheels that create the grand illusion called money a boring subject just wait youll be hooked in five minutes it sounds like a detective story which it really is but its all true based on mr griffins book of the same title this address will shatter your old ideas about money and change the way you view the world 1998 lecture
3951900 i have had a great time working with pleasure productions and especially matt zane
3951901 we have developed our sound without changing too much we dont want to upset our fans
3951902 here one of the more elegant writers in the intelligence community laid out his personal views and made a contribution to the dialog on the intelligence community
3951903 honda will produce 200 000 units of the new hatchback in japan it will be launched on earth day april 22
3951904 our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics
3951905 the torching of houses in these villages is in some ways a result of the massive russia propaganda machine which constantly repeats claims of genocide and exaggerates the casualties
3951906 by day five of a conflict one expects that there is some kind of list of the dead and injured but here there is no information nothing
3951907 due to circumstances beyond our control it was with deep regret that the decision was taken to postpone the miss world 2008 final this decision was taken in the interest of contestants and the miss world organisation
3951908 it would have been more than 30 000 for the academic year and that doesnt count summer right
3951909 but theres a big caveat here and thats that weve never experienced the perfect storm before rising tuitions well beyond inflation in a recessionary climate with a shrinking school age population
3951910 we believe this reduction in force which results from our cost savings initiatives will ultimately strengthen our position both in the short term and as the markets normalize
3951911 we will now need to review the full range of our relations
3951912 has been very clear for a long time ive been very concerned about russian behavior in a broad variety of areas
3951913 address the future of the alliances relationship with russia and with our g7 partners we should discuss whether it makes sense for russia to continue its participation in the g8
3951914 we also need to review russias aspiration for membership in the world trade organization
3951915 i dont think were going to re ignite the cold war here with russia i dont see this is a return to nuclear standoffs
3951916 between one candidate john mccain whos had experience been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate who has not
3951917 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3951918 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3951919 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
3951920 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
3951921 jack reads to her an hour a day as part of his home schooling
3951922 the world is whizzing around her and shes cool as a cucumber saying jack just started can i call you back
3951923 i cant i have a bf im going with david kique
3951924 anything that tends to focus on foreign policy has to help mccain a little bit
3951925 that is viewed as his strong point polling indicates thats where he has an edge on obama
3951926 saber rattling reaction to the russian incursion may have made some voters hair stand on end
3951927 when sex enters the scene a being fixates and loses power

3951932 los achaques derivados de la viudedad y los procesos de separaci n
3951933 i dont want to say they were dehydrated but they were very thirsty
3951934 in many instances the stories themselves do not provide the key necessary to decode them
3951935 you cannot find in the story itself the key you need to read it and its usually the people writing the story who have no idea that the key is lacking because they already have the information necessary to decode it
3951936 i feel like my constant problem with the daily news media is that either youre always entering the story in the middle or often at the end
3951937 and they dont do a very good job of talking about the beginning and what got us to this point where it became news
3951938 we got more listener feedback for that show than just about any show weve put out
3951939 it was overwhelmingly positive people were saying things like i didnt really understand this it was in the news all the time but i didnt know what they were talking about until i heard that episode it was very gratifying because thats exactly what my intent was because that was me i didnt understand it either fortunately i have a job where i get paid to go figure things out and report back and thats really what my goal was
3951940 i do think that ive noticed sort of like phrases appearing in newspapers that seemed like maybe they were influenced by the show
3951941 theres a young reporter that follows my feed on twitter
3951942 she writes for a newspaper in lafayette indiana the next day after i twittered about the this american life episode she had an assignment to do a localized version of the story about fannie mae and freddie mac and whether local bankers were affected it was very much a local version of that story she found she was way more prepared for that assignment because she had gone through the transcript of this show
3951943 we face a tough market in the year ahead but we are well placed to withstand these conditions with a proven business model clear strategy and sound property skills
3951944 we are budgeting for a nominal increase in earnings per security in financial year 2009 but it is going to be tough and we are assuming that market conditions do not deteriorate further
3951945 looking through the current cycle we expect to achieve higher earnings per security growth from financial year 2010 onwards
3951946 we have seen a steep decline in confidence in the australian reit real estate investment trust sector in recent months and were disappointed to have been impacted
3951947 we are intent on restoring confidence through our focus on value creation for our security holders and our sound balance sheet puts us in a good position to do so
3951948 our residential business also performed well despite deteriorating buyer sentiment and our ability to once again grow profits through a tough residential cycle demonstrates the quality and diversity of our business
3951949 active asset management and low occupancy costs should enable us to deliver further operational upside despite the recent slowdown in consumer spending
3951950 we remain of the view that the medium term prospects for the australian residential market are favourable due to high immigration and significant supply constraints
3951951 with approximately 70 of each years revenue coming from rolling multi year contracts we essentially have a large chunk of earnings locked in year on year
3951952 reported earnings are slightly higher than the guidance provided to the market on 1 july 2008 following finalisation of mis sales at nearly 814 hectares a 45 increase over fy07 and materially higher than the 650 hectares of sales projected at the outset of the year
3951953 tfs retains a strong growth outlook both over the short and longer term as we build on the momentum apparent in our mis product progressively benefit from our vertical integration initiatives and capitalise on the highly supportive global demand outlook for our sandalwood based produce
3951954 key priorities for tfs in fy09 will be the pursuit of further alliances with major global fragrance houses increased focus on research and development aimed at expanding the sandalwood bi products market and greater emphasis on global institutional investor growers to supplement existing mis growers

3951964 but when you confessed to me everything came rushing back ive never had a problem with gays its just that i was unsure about myself ive been thinking over various things like our jobs our future stuff along those lines but i realised that those things were irrelevant it was just about us i dont know if what i feel for you is more than friendship im sorry

3951986 how can i be a grim reaper why would i want to be a grim reaper
3951987 oh its not by your choice you just happened to be one because you filled up someones quota
3951988 listen kitten you know that nice lady that popped out your soul you were the last soul she was suppose to reap you filled her quota my dear thus she gets a promotion in this gig and you are the newbie to take her place
3951989 well all reapers have a certain quota to fill we dont know how many we need to reap but when we get that last soul we know we get to be promoted to where no idea but we also need a replacement to take care of our duties and that last soul we reaped gets to be the lucky soul to become a reaper
3951990 but i dont want to become a reaper i didnt want any of this
3951991 i want toast with butter bacon extra extra crispy with a side of home styled fries and scrambled eggs

3952117 es el mejor disco que he hecho hasta el momento porque l gicamente las canciones son muy buenas pero tambi n porque al no haberlas escrito yo nos han ofrecido una mezcla de respeto y libertad para interpretarlas sacando lo mejor de mi y el resto de los m sicos era una especie de experimento y la verdad es que ha sido una de las mejores experiencias que he tenido grabando
3952118 when we think there is a question of mental illness were going to look at two different tracks one being criminal prosecution and the other being mental illness and whether hospitalization is necessary

3952135 scratching by how government creates poverty as we know it available at fee org charles johnson of the molinari institute exposes the unsightly truth of what the state forces upon the poor
3952136 a governmental system that spends every year billions of dollars of the taxpayers money to make essential foodstuffs cotton and many other articles more expensive should certainly have the decency not to boast of an alleged war against poverty
3952137 we are living in a disastrously mixed economy which cannot be freed overnight
3952138 programs to drive drugs out of black neighborhoods need to be supplemented by strong and sustained police work

3952166 hes going into this ninth year too hes been a starting quarterback for a long time hes going to help the team
3952167 we know what we can do its not about lining up in formation and running a play now its about getting into a better play than the one we called in the huddle and running the one we like the best
3952168 from day one weve been way ahead of last year
3952169 we are working on timing of plays that we are running a lot of which we didnt run against baltimore
3952170 all those things were kind of on the hit parade and we will continue to work on those things about 20 percent of the time and the other 80 percent will be geared towards things that tampa bay does
3952171 we know canadians are excited about their athletes and want to see them win
3952172 canadians put way more pressure on professional sports do we value amateur sports in our country yeah i think we do but dont think we invest in it really heavily yet
3952173 in the next five to ten years i see more consolidation in every region of the world
3952174 we should expect to see chinese automakers exporting to north america soon as well as european manufacturers bringing their small cars here to manufacture and sell here as well as export back home to take advantage of the weak dollar

3952179 the judges decided to hold me and i guess i just let my nerves get the best of me
3952180 i have to put my mind in a little box and ignore the bad things going on around me
3952181 we know canadians are excited about their athletes and want to see them win
3952182 canadians put way more pressure on professional sports do we value amateur sports in our country yeah i think we do but dont think we invest in it really heavily yet
3952183 24 looking for jewish names to figure out exactly how many jews control hollywood lo and behold i see my friends name steven schub
3952184 i definitely have always responded to people who live what they believed and peter bergson was a guy who did he was a shining example of what one man can do and thats what he did how an individual can change history
3952185 he didnt fall into any left right of alternative he was a radical for individualism in same way ayn rand or jabotinsky was
3952186 instead of wasting their time fighting bergson they could have mobilized instead to create a tidal wave of pressure the non jews were more than glad to jump on board
3952187 i had been a student wife mother news executive and caregiver but i had always promised myself that one day i would be an actor
3952188 we were not surprised by the fine performance of the liege side we had seen enough of them to know they were a good aggressive side
3952189 the real surprise for me was the way liverpool played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
3952190 we will have to be a lot better in the second leg at anfield much better
3952191 we have been playing well in pre season looking confident and passing the ball well
3952192 but we did not do any of those things i did not want to bring steven gerrard on because the doctors had told me he was not fit enough to start the match
3952193 we waited until well into the second half before using him but we were not controlling the game and i had to bring him on
3952194 this game was far more difficult than we expected and jose reina was the man of the match
3952195 we know we can always rely on pepe to stop penalties but we have been told that the other effort may have been behind the line but these things happen
3952196 liverpool maybe came here asleep and not expecting this sort of game
3952197 maybe though we have woken them up for the second leg which will me much harder for us
3952198 we felt that if we did not lose this first leg we would still be in with a chance
3952199 maybe there have been misunderstandings and mistakes made but that happens in any big organisation when you make changes it is not an issue
3952200 i am clear we are going in the right direction its a great club and a big club i want to move it forward
3952201 my part of the club has not changed to any great extent we are interested in good players at the right price
3952202 people might have been concerned that maybe funds wont be available for me to bring players to the club i have been reassured that is not the case we are actively pursuing players
3952203 i had a meeting with all the players the other day and the contents will remain private
3952204 but basically we needed to make the group aware that i am in charge and will make decisions that will affect players
3952205 if players leave then that decision will be mine and mine solely thats where we are and i think everyone understands the situation
3952206 vedrans agent has a vested interest in his client but the matter has been resolved

3952218 according to taketomi true vip style tuning is limited to only 10 nissan and toyota models nissan president cima gloria cedric and fuga toyota celsior century aristo crown and majesta thats it since most of those models come with powerful turbocharged engines in japan vip style cars are rarely tuned for performance more important is that theyre slammed as low as they can go on the widest wheels possible most of the other tuning parts somehow assist in this goal vip stylers use air suspensions to raise their cars to install the wheels and tires and then lower the car on top tires are stretched beyond their limits to fit on oversized wheels extreme offsets are used so the wheel lips kiss the fenders and its not unusual to see 245 30r tires on 19x10 5 inch wheels the tuning equivalent of fat albert wearing the shorts of his enunciation challenged friend mushmouth
3952219 i know that is something his attorneys are working on now

3952243 i just tried to keep myself calm ever since yesterdays semi so i thought i did that and came out and did a pb when it mattered most
3952244 i didnt pick anything up and disregarded it and when i went inside i complained to mum about the litter around the yard
3952245 she said well theyve been there for days then my dad came in and he was holding a couple of papers and we had a look at them and they had coles chisholm written on them
3952246 its not like a carbon copy or photocopy theyre actually originals with blue pens
3952247 i didnt happen to find any of my signatures on them but mine could be among those on the oval
3952248 i dont know how they deal with the disposal of these things but im not going to shop there if theyre going to carry on like that

3952260 the legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done but cannot do at all or cannot so well do for themselves in their separate and individual capacities
3952261 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
3952262 what does this game really need that it doesnt have
3952263 lack of flexibility is the average golfers number 1 problem it is due to lack of flexibility that the average golf cannot perform a fundamentally correct golf swing motion finding out what muscle restrictions a person has is the first step in finding a solution to the swing faults that are plaguing my students

3952282 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3952283 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3952284 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3952285 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3952286 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3952287 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3952288 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3952289 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3952290 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3952291 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3952292 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3952375 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3952376 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3952436 now that transfers have been stripped from us there is nothing to encourage new teachers to come to dubbo
3952437 like many other schools in dubbo the distance education centre struggles to find casual teachers when our permanent teachers are ill or away for other duties

3952448 there were these unique workshops the rent was low and we were able to freely create art here

3952469 sprint is required to vacate the spectrum as part of a larger fcc plan to swap spectrum with public safety agencies in the 800 megahertz band a move aimed at minimizing interference between wireless service and public safety users
3952470 if there are merits and fcc grants additional waivers then criteria 1 would fail
3952471 if fcc sees the sprints petition does not hold the merit for additional waivers then they would make a judgment on sprint and possibly impose fines then criteria 1 would pass

3952479 little is known about the efficacy of mental health interventions for children exposed to armed conflicts in low and middle income settings childhood mental health problems are difficult to address in situations of ongoing poverty and political instability
3952480 no changes were found on the other outcome variables traumatic idioms depressive anxiety symptoms and functioning the latter for boys we hypothesize that these results may show that psychosocial interventions alone are unable to reverse the challenges to psychosocial well being presented by chronic poverty and political instability
3952481 in short a school based psychosocial intervention was able to moderately reduce ptsd symptoms retain hope and improve functioning for girls and retain hope for boys affected by communal violence in a low income context
3952482 further adaptations and research to address the full range of post traumatic outcomes and functioning are necessary

3952558 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
3952559 to somehow suggest obama is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in montana running for president is absurd
3952560 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight
3952561 my tomatoes grow from the soil with no additives those from the eu are picture perfect as if made by michelangelo but mine are better and tastier and you can eat them as they come no chemicals
3952562 that is why i plan to increase hectares under apples medicinal herbs and vegetables in the next two years
3952563 we cannot be a major exporter we cannot compete with others in terms of quantity or price we must look for particular market niches for our indigenous products wine cheese plum brandy and to sell our home grown food to tourists
3952564 the problems are small and fractured estates old and uneducated population dated technology poorly developed market infrastructure unfortunately croatia has never had a farming strategy to address those issues
3952565 they did not find it profitable to work the land and there were no punitive measures for keeping the land unused so it just lay there
3952566 and prepare for the competition once the market is fully open
3952567 but the huge german cheese market for example has only two percent of goat cheese so i do see a big chance to sell our products abroad
3952568 our vegetables are perhaps a bit more pricey but they are home grown freshly picked untreated with chemicals buyers always prefer our own products
3952569 we know we dont produce enough and well always have to import but we want to increase exports to improve the balance
3952570 the eu has lower subsidies for wine therefore it will be a shock which we want to overcome by encouraging people to invest in technology and new vineyards and focus on quality though there is not much time left
3952571 our wine makers face uncertain times with the eu membership but some of them could really benefit the eu has 500 million people so we should find a place there is always room for original local varieties of wine
3952572 as far as red wine goes i would not dream of competing with france or spain
3952573 but grasevina riesling pinot i am sure i can compete with the big producers in quality and price
3952574 i have one eye looking very closely at developments back home i speak to people i have family there but im not going to rush anything
3952575 ive been here a long time i have a family here and its not just a case of upping and leaving and going back theres a lot to take into account i know a lot of zimbabwean professionals who are in a similar situation
3952576 i need to be able to go back and set myself up with a job that allows me to provide for my family both my immediate family and the extended family and that is not going to happen overnight
3952577 political stability is essential and other things will fall into place after that but it will take time
3952578 right now the risk takers are already taking up positions
3952579 even the regular man on the street in zimbabwe right now is very entrepreneurial he has to be or otherwise he wont make enough to survive i think that entrepreneurial spirit is going to be carried forward and so people will have to be sharp
3952580 a lot of colleagues and professionals living here in england have already developed their networks back home for me it wouldnt take me more than a few months to go back even if it might take five years for the situation to really turn around or even for the exchange rate to stabilize
3952581 there are many many people who would want to return and contribute to the rebuilding of zimbabwe but there is still uncertainty and a lack of clarity about what role the diaspora would play
3952582 there are people who have been tortured raped people whose families have been killed do they want to return right away without knowing if there will be justice
3952583 i think many people will wait to see how the situation develops to make sure that there is no longer violence that inflation has gone down perhaps it will be one or two years
3952584 i think you will see zimbabweans making new ties testing the water to go back but not leaving everything theyve got here because they cant afford to go back and lose everything
3952585 people with money to invest whether in property or small businesses or mineral processing they are ready but the time is not yet its still some time off
3952586 how can they afford to sell the eye glasses at such low prices

3952596 you really need to know why youre adopting these technologies
3952597 you cant just leap in every time a new things gets hyped
3952598 one day it will be as simple to use as electricity and you just plug it in
3952599 a lot of the hype will be around the promise that has been held out for a very simple to use flexible approach to information technology and the reality of achieving that is going to be out of line
3952600 whenever you try to achieve one of these big dreams its inevitably harder to get there than you think and it takes longer to get there than people tend to think
3952601 i think the quality of the experience that these systems have brought is very attractive and it does start to introduce an element of feeling that you are at least partially there
3952602 that has been missing in previous generations of the technology
3952603 they will go to the actual facebook or myspace route and say yep we want to bring it in and well figure out what the problems are once we do that
3952604 you have this peripheral vision of whats happening around you that a lot of the more point to point collaboration tools dont give you
3952605 they are willing to put up with the unknowns that you get when you get popular consumer technologies into the enterprise

3952608 our intent to build a new headquarters in rochester has not changed
3952609 we are still working very diligently with city and state officials on the project
3952610 we approved a stock repurchase program because we do not believe that the current stock price is indicative of the companys value and our growth prospects
3952611 the boards approval of the share repurchase program reflects its confidence in the continued growth of paetec our ability to generate significant cash flow and an ongoing commitment to creating shareholder value
3952612 boy buggering in both islam and catholicism is okay with the pope as long as it isnt reported by the liberal press
3952613 so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the laywers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it
3952614 john mccain once claimed that agents of intolerance had no place in our political system and he pledged to run a new kind of campaign
3952615 if mccain stands to benefit from such political extremists he has a moral responsibility to categorically condemn corsis hate speech as inappropriate not just for catholics but for the entirety of our public discourse

3952625 gm plans to introduce a new hybrid system annually for the next several years each offering different levels of affordability fuel savings and performance
3952626 adaptive mechanisms for inferring harmful intentions which can account for rapid yet not necessarily accurate judgments from faces
3952627 overall people do a pretty bad job when it comes to judging people based on appearances
3952628 should we continue to rely on making decisions based on appearances or should we actually be taking steps to ignore them
3952629 if people use faces or appearances to draw their impressions of others
3952630 they must be doing that because they think those assumptions are correct if you couldnt get any good information from appearances then a rational person wouldnt use this information to make their decisions
3952631 asking participants to deliberate and make a good judgment not only dramatically increased the response times but also reduced the predictive accuracy of the judgments
3952632 what about that face is making people say it looks trustworthy or untrustworthy
3952633 when you go to extreme lengths to make a face appear trustworthy the face appears as if its smiling and when you go to extreme lengths to make a face appear untrustworthy it appears as if is angry
3952634 there is a tendency in our field to do what is described as the reverse inference you see that a particular brain region is active and from this you make an inference about the persons psychology or emotional state for instance if i see that the amygdala is active i might infer that the person is afraid however if the shape of the curve is u shaped this is not a valid inference to make
3952635 when you see someone and you think i can tell hes smart most people are actually pretty confident in their own judgment but it turns out that youre not really accurate most of the time and if our theory is correct it turns out that among other things your system for detecting emotions is inappropriately overgeneralizing
3952636 for details oddly the story has nothing to do with any possible punishments the spaniards would face honestly we cant think of any the bad pr and embarrassment should be punishment enough but the story does offer a

3952653 when we think there is a question of mental illness were going to look at two different tracks one being criminal prosecution and the other being mental illness and whether hospitalization is necessary
3952654 come up with a plan on how to murder someone
3952655 either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
3952656 im not even sure if i would have gone through with it
3952657 if at all possible it would only be a complete stranger
3952658 we see behavior that is very scary and yet were limited by the law as to how we can respond to it

3952661 the risks are real the core problem is that most people who are getting an iphone have never used their mobile for web browsing and have no idea about how much data they will actually use

3952663 i alleged that these people knew full well the catastrophic effect their decision would have on pan its employees customers service providers shareholders and of course me and my family both financially and personally
3952664 the driver for all of these moves is to develop and keep very strong one on one relationships with employees they see a lot of value in these relationships and are prepared to put more on the table in terms of pay and conditions to maintain them

3952698 we cant be behind nfa all the time if the goals are scored they are only consolation if we dont win the league title in the process
3952699 it was a very entertaining game but the game is about scoring goals they converted their chances we didnt the positive is that we are still three points ahead lionel munaf had a great game and if not for him and muhairin things would have been different credit to them and the home team for an overall good performance

3952708 she went all the way chick lit at its worst
3952709 this is the first time a large scale data set has been used to observe the effect of micrornas on the production of thousands of proteins
3952710 previous technology enabled us to only look at how micrornas affect messenger rnas that provided us with crucial information about their involvement in the first stage of protein translation but not their ultimate effect on gene expression
3952711 by measuring protein levels we could illustrate that micrornas fine tune gene expression rather than simply working as a switch to turn a gene on or off
3952712 the knockout mouse model enabled us to more accurately gauge the interactions of micrornas with their regulatory targets and to confirm what we found earlier in human cells
3952713 surprisingly the protein levels of cells missing microrna 223 nearly matched those of normal cells
3952714 this microrna changed the expression level of hundreds of proteins but only by a small amount
3952715 we still cannot predict perfectly which genes are targeted by a particular microrna but at least now we know which of the proposed prediction methods are most useful
3952716 there had been a suspicion that the majority of microrna regulation would happen in a manner that doesnt really change the amount of messenger rna
3952717 we found that this wasnt true at least for this particular microrna
3952718 how could rna trigger changes in ancient cells without all the proteins present in modern cells well in this case no proteins no problem
3952719 decide which genes in the cell to activate an ability once thought to rest exclusively with proteins
3952720 we predicted that there would be an ancient rna city out there in the jungle and we went out and found it breaker said
3952721 de som kommer til f lge lover og regler n r det gjelder denne saken er oss
3952722 micrornas unique characteristics as sensitive and specific biomarkers coupled with our strong development engines enable us to expand and advance our development programs outside the oncology field
3952723 there is true unmet medical need for better diagnostics in womens health and i am confident that the rabin medical centers world renowned researchers will assist us in bringing better diagnostics to patients worldwide
3952724 the genes we identified are necessary for embryonic stem cells to maintain a memory of who they are
3952725 without them the cell doesnt know whether it should remain a stem cell or differentiate into a specialized cell
3952726 we think the prices of everything will go up but overall we are not expecting any major changes
3952727 i think there will be less competition and that will drive up the pricing
3952728 the price of reagents has already increased over the past year and part of that is due to inflation but also the result of i think a lack of competition
3952729 affect ncode in any way because there already is a lot of competition in the mirna array market
3952730 from our perspective we dont think it will have much of an impact on us
3952731 it would be an interesting decision to radically change pricing due to the acquisition because if you compare it with the competitors offerings abis stuff is at a reasonable price
3952732 a significant price increase of 15 to 20 percent could drive longstanding customers to look into other opportunities and at other platforms
3952733 i dont know how much room there is to absorb that kind of increase in the market it would be controversial considering the overall marketplace for genomics assays
3952734 even though abi is bigger technically it is invitrogen that is buying abi and i think it is unclear who will be the brand and who will drive it
3952735 how this deal will affect the quality of support for our instruments
3952736 they are going to have some problems and people are going to spend a lot of time figuring it out
3952737 when two companies of that size combine it is theoretically impossible that it wouldnt have some effect on their customers
3952738 if anything there are plenty of opportunities for the two technologies to be used together
3952739 they could adopt mass spec readouts to protein arrays for example
3952740 an opportunity to design more kits for this area so its a win win situation
3952741 we look forward to the completion of the project for this community
3952742 were created by the failure of level 5 the developer to submit plans to the various county departments that met the applicable county requirements
3952743 we would like the opportunity to use golf carts on summergrove streets given the recent price rise of gasoline
3952744 for me this is simply an issue of public safety
3952745 it is not a very safe situation to put golf carts in the same traffic flow with an suv or a volkswagen for that matter if you show me im wrong i will have an open mind about it
3952746 golf carts racing across lower fayetteville in a crosswalk is just an accident waiting to happen
3952747 i would hate to see this turned down because of one crossing
3952748 youve got to get your folks to respond back to us
3952749 in anticipation of the economy not being better we decided instead of rolling back the tax rate to leave it the same
3952750 it has come to my attention that these rights of way were asking for are essentially to put in five foot sidewalks because the existing four foot sidewalks are in awful condition
3952751 could we replace the four foot sidewalk without going through further steps
3952752 we cant do improvements unless we bring it up to ada standard
3952753 there are a lot of activities that go on that are educational
3952754 well want to have an agreement with them to collaborate with students and serve in internships within our facility
3952755 were tired of seeing kids walk around after school so many of them can use structured activities but also some homework help
3952756 thats not to say anything bad about the other group but this is a greater need and if we only have one facility we need to do whats best for the greater amount of people
3952757 the biggest challenge to current single cell analysis is the fact that over expression of fluorescent protein labeled targets is still necessary and likely to severely perturb physiological processes
3952758 eventually the same techniques will be multiplexed and further expanded to live animal studies allowing cell biology to realize its full potential
3952759 the ability to analyze gene expression at the single cell level will enable much more accurate studies of cell population homo heterogeneity in their regulation of gene expression
3952760 experimentally the needs for sample preparation and pcr are removed and as part of the analysis the user can view and quantify actual single cell gene expression levels using ogts single molecule scanner
3952761 technology limited applications including monitoring single cell infection events stem cell analysis and cancer cell analysis will be enabled with the combination of the cell population array and the single molecule scanner
3952762 the system is unique in that it enables the acquisition of kinetic data of non adherent cells currently most of the tools designed for dynamic monitoring of single cells only permit the analysis of adherent cells
3952763 the simultaneous acquisition of kinetic data related to drug action response to stimulators calcium flux as well as gene expression patterns from numerous cells
3952764 we use tools from the semiconductor industry such as electron beam lithography to pattern structures on the substrate which then guide the motion of molecules in the synthetic membrane and inside the living cell through specific ligand receptor interactions
3952765 we have shown that such chemically identical but spatially different systems exhibit different behavior
3952766 the significance of this last point is that one could not predict this based solely on chemical analysis of the cells
3952767 electroporation breaks the membrane barrier to release intracellular materials while cells flow through a pre defined section of a microfluidic channel
3952768 efc has the unique capability of detecting events that are not detectable using flow cytometry for example we recently demonstrated the detection of protein translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane using efc
3952769 the biggest challenge associated with single cell analysis is the low throughput certain procedures that are required for the analysis of intracellular molecules such as lysis of cells limit the throughput to less than 100 cells min
3952770 further development to improve the throughput of single cell analysis to a level of flow cytometry about 10 000 cells s will likely happen in the future
3952771 quantification of the strength of protein interactions remains challenging due to difficulties in measuring the absolute fret efficiency and the concentrations of donors and acceptors the three parameters needed to calculate dissociation constants most imaging experiments do not measure the fret efficiency instead they measure the sensitized acceptor emission
3952772 the qi fret method allows the determination of the donor and the acceptor concentrations and the fret efficiency i e the three parameters that are sufficient to calculate dissociation constants in each cell derived vesicle
3952773 as we dive deeper into the complex molecular behavior inside cells we are finding that it is not just biology in there many things turning up stray far beyond the normal confines of classical biology and are drawing in chemistry physics material science and engineering in ways that have not happened before
3952774 this will actually cut out a part of the process
3952775 more and more people are realizing almost every biological pathway has mirna involvement
3952776 there are so many political leaders from the state and the confederacy
3952777 you can literally make a couple of days of it
3952778 tg2 appears to fuel different types of cancer through multiple molecular pathways making it an important therapeutic target
3952779 drug resistance and metastasis are major impediments to the successful treatment of ovarian cancer and until now we had little information about the role tg2 played in ovarian cancer
3952780 we began to see its story unfold as we translated this data from tissue samples to cell lines to animal models
3952781 from this investigation it became clear that tg2 activates the survival pathway p13k akt in these tumors explaining the adverse resistant behavior we observed on a molecular level
3952782 we then focused on whether silencing tg2 would block these effects
3952783 when exposed to this potent targeted therapy ovarian cancer cells greatly reduced cancer cell proliferation and blood vessel development while increasing apoptosis
3952784 while it remains to be seen if these results will translate in humans looking ahead long term it will be an attractive option against advanced ovarian cancer
3952785 this aberrant protein is doing so many different things you would have to develop a small molecule drug to block each function
3952786 liposomal sirna is exciting because it takes out tg2 completely blocking everything that it does
3952787 these findings reveal a hitherto unknown and for myeloma cells critical network of gene activity centered on this one protein
3952788 what we have now is a new window of opportunity for therapeutic development in multiple myeloma
3952789 there is no clear molecular link between mutations associated with hereditary cardiomyopathies inheritance of the disease and the abnormal growth of cardiac muscle cells leading to the suspicion that other still unknown factors are involved
3952790 these results highlight the diversity of rna mediated epigenetic effects they extend the concept of a mode of variation and heredity distinct from and complementary to principles of mendelian genetics an observation that is potentially significant for both fundamental biology and pathology
3952791 our findings about the underlying mechanisms of rna activated gene expression reveal a new and unexpected target for potential drug development
3952792 involvement of rna at a gene promoter is a new concept potentially a big new concept
3952793 interactions at gene promoters are critical for understanding disease and our results bring a new dimension to understanding how genes can be regulated
3952794 by demonstrating how small rnas can be used to recruit proteins to gene promoters we have provided further evidence that this phenomenon should be in the mainstream of science
3952795 this paper shows that we share a common genetic imprinting mechanism which has been active for about 150 million years despite the differences in reproductive strategies between marsupials and humans
3952796 our team provided vital samples and genetic resources from marsupials to enable this study and contributed our world leading expertise on marsupial biology and genomics to the interpretation of the results
3952797 we all carry two copies of every gene in our dna one inherited from our mother and one from our father so for each gene we have a back up normally both copies of the gene are used for development but in some special cases the gene from either our mother or father is switched off so we only have one active copy this phenomenon is known as genomic imprinting
3952798 because there is no back up copy when errors occur in this process it results in many human genetic diseases mainly affecting growth and brain function
3952799 we inherit a single working copy of this gene from our fathers while the copy we inherit from our mothers is switched off the switch for this gene is controlled by another gene known as h19 the h19 gene is unusual gene that makes a microrna and not a protein
3952800 microrna genes have been sought in marsupials for years and now for the first time one has been discovered
3952801 it helps us to determine how the mechanism works and what we can do to avoid the development of a number of human diseases
3952802 we found that smad proteins the signal carriers of a group of proteins that help regulate cells promote the processing of a subset of microrna including mir 21 smad proteins control the processing of mirna from a primary copy of rna pri mirna to precursor mirna pre mirna
3952803 smad proteins move to the nucleus of the cell and interact with a specific complex called the drosha microprocessor complex to promote the processing of pri mir 21 to pre mir 21 eventually leading to an increase in mature mir 21 levels
3952804 mature mir 21 targets a tumor suppressor gene important for programmed cell death in both cancer cells and in smooth muscle cells the cells that help our veins and arteries contract and relax
3952805 abnormal mirna processing is a contributing factor in cardiovascular disorders and cancer yet little is known about its regulation
3952806 since pri mir 21 levels did not change we concluded that the tgf family of growth factors doesnt begin to play a role in mirna processing until the pri mirna to pre mirna step
3952807 smad proteins were thought to act exclusively by regulating the transcription of dna into messenger rna mrna in response to tgf signaling this finding reveals a new role of smad proteins as regulators of mirna processing
3952808 if we want to generate a drug that regulates signaling by tgf we now have the option to target different pathways downstream of tgf and achieve much more specific outcomes
3952809 thus cells with abnormal mirna levels may have abnormal protein levels putting the organism at risk for many diseases including cancer and cardiovascular disorders more research needs to be done to elucidate further the roles of mir 21 and other mirna molecules
3952810 because better understanding of how mirnas effect disease may lead to a clearer understanding of disease initiation and progression
3952811 ithink that perhaps it may be time for a fresh start
3952812 in general its been accepted that micrornas down regulate gene expression by binding to 3 utrs of target mrnas andthat this binding leads to a repression of protein synthesis from targeted mrnas either by degradation or in some wayinterfering with translation
3952813 if you can think of a mechanism by which mirnas function its been proposed and actually there isgood data for them all
3952814 the biogenesis of all micrornas isthought to be the same the assembly into risc is thought to be the same and micrornas in general despite thedifferences in their sequence are all physically the same
3952815 the magnitude of regulation can vary dramatically from less than two fold to greater than10 fold
3952816 the levels of regulation arenot strictly correlated with the number of target sites or the degree of pairing
3952817 there are examples where there is one site that can give very dramatic regulation and there are other examples wherefour or five sites give one and a half fold type regulation
3952818 weve been unable to reproduce most of the data that has been published by other labs
3952819 we decidedto take a different path which is to look at a differentiation system that throws a new wrinkle into mechanisms ofmicrornp regulation
3952820 shift towards that of brain the organ in which mir 124 is preferentially expressed whereas delivering mir 1 shifts the profiletowards that of muscle where mir 1 is preferentially expressed
3952821 very small and we wanted to see how the mrna would behave in a real muscle cell
3952822 we did the hela cell experiments described in nature as well and saw about two fold regulation of these constructs
3952823 it could be that the cell state in the differentiatedmyotube in some way promotes the ability of the micrornp to act we think it is more likely that there is a muscle specificfactor that interacts with proteins that make up risc such that the level of regulation is much higher in thedifferentiated cells
3952824 most if not all of what has been done in terms of determining the mechanism of regulation and magnitude of regulation has been done in normal tissue culture cells
3952825 we would suggest that there is something quite differentin a differentiated muscle cell
3952826 i would be very cautious of the mechanisms that have been worked out in rapidly proliferating cells like hela cells whichhave been constantly growing since 1948 and may have adapted to avoid microrna regulation
3952827 to somehow suggest obama is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in montana running for president is absurd
3952828 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight
3952829 moms are the decision makers of the household as far as purchases are concerned
3952830 a free daily e mail from the front lines of fashion food and fun
3952831 i love women women are more than half the population and they do most of the shopping
3952832 we are constantly looking for more sites that cater to women
3952833 is expected to investigate the safety and efficacy of this novel sirna delivery system in an animal model for therapeutic application
3952834 the first is produced by chemically crosslinking large recombinant rna binding proteins to antibodies
3952835 the sirna non covalently associates with the targeting antibody via the rna binding protein
3952836 functional modified sirnas to antibodies using heterobifunctional cross linking agents containing internal cell labile structures to promote the release of the sirna after internalization
3952837 thus the nih funded project will develop several independent strategies to enhance the therapeutic activity
3952838 we will encapsulate multiple sets of sirna targeting to different cellular oncogenes to show at least an additive if not synergistic effect in tumor killing
3952839 the proposed inhalation system will be capable of delivering a continuous stream of micronized dry powder aerosol into the respiratory tract of children
3952840 an important question is whether rnai is a natural cellular defense mechanism in mammals including humans
3952841 in analogy with the combination of several drugs in conventional virus therapy various sirnas against the virus can be combined to prevent viral escape
3952842 two clinical trials to use rnai against viruses are ongoing
3952843 there is a phase ii trial with sirnas against the respiratory syncitial virus and a phase i trial to treat patients infected with hiv
3952844 three clinical trials are ongoing to treat patients with age related macular degeneration furthermore one talk at the conferences was about the use of rnai against cancer a clinical trial for that was announced to begin at the end of 2008
3952845 this isnt a time for partisanship and sniping between campaigns
3952846 this is about hundreds of thousand of individuals whose lives are being taken maybe later on in the campaign lets have a back and forth about whose comments and statements but now lets devote all our efforts to resolving a situation that is fraught with tragedy
3952847 if microrna expression can be used to classify cancer what are the mechanisms that lead to this characteristic expression pattern in cancer
3952848 if its not about jesus then somehow the gospel is not being preached
3952849 what is this to me and you woman my hour has not yet come
3952850 one of the ten notable advances of the year 2007
3952851 we live in a world of useless information and every few minutes someone tips another bucket of it over us
3952852 the media are working so hard to be relevant pretty pathetic to see all that wasted energy directed against the most honest party leader and party in parliament
3952853 i guess you got to expect that when you are one of the most successful and influential foreign ministers on the planet
3952854 completing some large animal efficacy studies within a year or so and moving very quickly toward our first indication for a microrna manipulating agent hopefully within two or two and a half years of financing
3952855 defining the key micrornas and specific clinical indication we want to go after
3952856 the standard of care for heart failure in a variety of different cardiovascular disorders is catheterization
3952857 so were going to leverage some semi invasive mechanical delivery technologies that allow us to do pseudo local delivery
3952858 got together and started talking about some of the investigators discoveries in terms of microrna changes in cardiovascular disease
3952859 we ended up formally founding and moving the company forward
3952860 were going to go after cardiovascular and related muscle disorders and really focus on that
3952861 our first indications will be in heart failure but the complete focus of the company is cardiovascular disorders disorders of the heart and vascular system as well as related muscle disorders
3952862 a very restricted set of micrornas that are either up regulated or down regulated in response to cardiac hypertrophy
3952863 the re activation of a set of fetal cardiac genes including those encoding fetal isoforms of contractile proteins such as beta myosin heavy chain
3952864 the consequences of fetal gene expression on cardiac function and remodeling are not completely understood but the up regulation of beta mhc a slow atpase and down regulation of alpha mhc a fast contracting atpase in response to stress has been implicated in the diminution of cardiac function
3952865 this kind of gene program remodeling has been the subject of intense studies by a couple of different pharmaceutical companies in terms of identifying what molecular targets would be the best and olson identified a variety of micrornas that are changing
3952866 when they knocked out this particular microrna generated the full homozygous knockout animal and induced heart failure through a technique called thoracic aortic banding that mouse doesnt go through hypertrophy and doesnt develop heart failure suggesting that this would be an excellent target for therapeutic intervention
3952867 our belief is that in terms of the microrna manipulation itself what really counts is attributing function with micrornas
3952868 what weve been able to do is license intellectual property around the establishment of a particular disease with a microrna perturbation
3952869 in terms of developing the therapeutic molecules themselves were going to look at a broad spectrum of different molecules
3952870 novel molecules that would allow us to have a unique intellectual property position
3952871 were certainly very interested in talking with any potential partners in terms of moving our programs forward
3952872 weve purposely been trying to work on a lot on things very quietly and havent been real active in terms of partnering but that will definitely change as soon as we start ramping up
3952873 there are three compelling scientific reasons that favor microrna replacement therapy
3952874 number one numerous studies show us that the majority of differentially expressed micrornas are down regulated in tumor tissue
3952875 a microrna mimetic is the closest equivalent to a naturally occurring molecule and therefore less likely to induce non specific side effects
3952876 the 3 utrs of the human ras genes contain multiple let 7 complementary sites allowing let 7 to regulate ras expression
3952877 let 7 expression is lower in lung tumors than in normal lung tissue while ras protein is significantly higher in lung tumors providing a possible mechanism for let 7 in cancer
3952878 this was pretty much one of the first demonstrations that functionally implicated a microrna in human cancer
3952879 puts out the stop sign and blocks certain specific oncogenic pathways
3952880 due to genetic aberrations let 7 might get lost or become expressed in reduced levels which now uncouples these genes from let 7 and leads to an increase of gene expression and or associated pathways
3952881 about 85 percent of all tumor samples displayed reduced expression of let 7 and reduced expression was not limited to any particular tumor type
3952882 robustly inhibit the proliferation of lung cancer cells in comparison to cells treated with a so called negative control microrna
3952883 took advantage of a transgenic mouse model for lung cancer that closely resembles lung tumor formation in a human being and asked the question whether administration of an adenovirus that encodes the let 7 microrna would interfere with this tumorogenesis process
3952884 of course this is not a very thorough assessment of microrna safety but it was at least the first indication that microrna expression was well tolerated
3952885 the ultimate question really is especially from a therapeutic standpoint whether let 7 is able to tackle established tumors
3952886 we have already begun to combine micrornas with other treatment regimes to see if the micrornas can sensitize cancer cells to conventional therapies
3952887 a library of micrornas and transfected them into breast cancer cells and then followed up with a pro apoptotic treatment
3952888 we identified a list of micrornas including let 7 that can sensitize these cancer cells about two fold to treatment
3952889 so clearly let 7 seems to have great therapeutic potential although we have identified other tumor suppressor micrornas that have shown universal therapeutic activity
3952890 our data indicate that gene expression is coordinately regulated such that states of increased proliferation are associated with widespread reductions in the 3 utr based regulatory capacity of mrnas

3952892 our country simply cannot afford to have insecure supply of electricity
3952893 alternate reality in which theres no such thing as climate change
3952894 national argues we need fossil fuel electricity generation in order to safeguard security of supply which is totally untrue
3952895 latest figures suggest that 1520mw of new generation will be commissioned over the next four years more than twice what is required to meet the increase in demand and most of which will be renewables
3952896 however we will not let the 90 percent target get in the way of security of supply we will continue to need the constant reliability of thermal generation

3952904 those who deal in long steel products will feel it more because they use electric hub furnaces to melt the rawmaterial flat players will not feel it as much because their raw material is already prepared into coils hence upstream players will bear the costs more
3952905 it is harder for consumercompanies such as those in food and beverage to increase theirprices due to the competitive nature of the industry if anything most adopt a wait and see approach to see what moves their competitors make
3952906 while theincrease in electricity cost will definitely affect the cost ofproduction it is still manageable for some however it is theeffect of these hikes on consumer spending habits that will pose the bigger problem
3952907 not too bad my arms kinda draggin a little its not really sore just fatigued
3952908 no pain but im 38 years old i have to be fatigued a little
3952909 its not really sore just fatigued no pain but im 38 years old so you have to be fatigued a little bit
3952910 we only have two practices left before the game and we do monitor that stuff
3952911 i wondered this morning when i got up what the heck am i doing
3952912 i felt 38 today im not going to lie to you
3952913 i hate to study and at times i hate to practice but i love to play
3952914 i know i need to study i know i need to practice i know how important it is but it doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that the answer is yes theres no substitute for sunday
3952915 my wife told me your worst enemy is probably your memory
3952916 i said look i heard youre not talking to the media
3952917 he said its not that its not that i said look im not here to take
3952918 i think hell realize if he doesnt already that im an easygoing guy easy to work with
3952919 you drop a ball so what i throw bad passes were in this together and id like for us to come out of it together
3952920 we believe this is going to make a very important impact to the field of sirna delivery
3952921 this work helps to overcome the longstanding barrier in the sirna field how to achieve high silencing efficiency with low toxicity
3952922 we believe the improvement is caused by the endosome escape and the ability of the quantum dots to separate from the sirna
3952923 looking forward this work will have important implications in in vivo sirna therapeutics which will require the use of nontoxic iron oxide and biodegradable polymeric carriers rather than quantum dots
3952924 yess very much keep doing it i like it very much
3952925 yes even i too have been waiting for this day for so long i always wanted to do this with u but was afraid of telling it to you luckily for me today u did it keep loving me i also want to be loved by u for as much time as possible you are a great lover i never knew love making is so much enjoyable plz love me keep loving me
3952926 yeah lets take them off you take off mine and i will yours
3952927 wait manisha i have a better way of removing the underwear i will stand and u kneel before me so that yr head is in front of my undie and then start removing it with yr teeth ok

3952930 in a small saucepan over medium heat bring the cream to a gentle boil
3952931 whisk the chocolate and cream mixture together until very smooth this is referred to as ganache a mixture of chocolate and cream refrigerate in an airtight container for at least 5 hours or overnight
3952932 using a small melon baller or a small teaspoon scoop small balls of ganache into your hand and roll until somewhat smooth and round these should be approximately 1
3952933 truffles may be stored for up to two weeks at a cool room temperature 55 65 degrees in an airtight container do not refrigerate or freeze this damages the texture of the creamy ganache

3952935 our results suggest that mir 203 functions as a tumor suppressor and re expression of this microrna might have therapeutic benefits in specific hematopoietic malignancies including some acute or chronic leukemias
3952936 this may be particularly beneficial for patients who are resistant to small molecule kinase inhibitors like gleevec as resistant isoforms of abl and bcr abl should contain the target site for mir 203 and are likely to respond to restored mir 203 function
3952937 it is important to remember though that despite these novel findings it is still most crucial to move forwards with cancer prevention through changes in diet and life style

3952944 the orders were served on the first defendant certainly that betters our position and what we are doing at the moment is observing whether he will breach that order by playing in a game scheduled for friday morning
3952945 you miss one tackle like i experienced last week and its a try so there is a lot of pressure on there
3952946 its the joys of international sport you mark someone who is world class and its something i really pride myself on my d so when you make one little slip up once and it leads to a try it really
3952947 hopefully you move on and learn from it it didnt cost us the game thankfully so if i learn from it then i will look back on it and maybe its done you some good
3952948 yeah mortlock brian odriscoll and guys like that it is tough but its part of the challenge i enjoy
3952949 you need that experience to read the opposition attack and as you say de villiers is another world class and will be a handful wherever he plays
3952950 jean does that quite a bit in super 14 weve noticed on the tapes that quite often on defence he will move to outside centre and then on attack switch back to inside so its something we are used to with him
3952951 he orchestrates a lot of their attack so we will have to be on our toes but we are worrying more about what we have to do and i guess if thats affecting the game in any way then we will deal with it on the day
3952952 they base a lot of their game on taking small opportunities and making it count the pace they have out wide and the midfielders theyve got
3952953 their game will be about building pressure and then when they create a mistake they pounce thats how their games been for years
3952954 the coaches have been true to their word right from the start they said they would not leave guys without any games so we knew that would happen
3952955 i have always had the confidence of the coaches even though i wasnt playing i was told the reasons why and it wasnt like i was left in the dark about it
3952956 ive played all over the place in the last four years and its not really that different wherever you play the skill sets pretty much the same
3952957 its just the opposition that changes and i happen to be marking the fastest rugby player on the planet so it is going to be a big challenge but im looking forward to that
3952958 obviously they the springboks wings are quick habanas one of the quickest men around so when you are playing someone like him its just being a bit smarter and being ahead of wherever hes going
3952959 pace is a real advantage and he will be looking to use it so i need to use my brains and the pace ive got to shut him down
3952960 no one really takes too much notice of speed times its funny because some guys who are lightning quick between the lights at training when they get on the field they arent quite so quick
3952961 its more about what they call game speed your balance being able to beat a man at pace that sort of stuff so we arent worrying about them having more pace out wide than us
3952962 the sheer number of people that turned out it was just crazy
3952963 the queue for autographs literally stretched out the door of the shopping mall and there were people waiting as far as the eye could see

3952965 ill teach you to show me the f ing red card you so and so
3952966 they obviously agreed to come together pool resources and move this forward the idea here is that it requires the sort of industrial muscle that a company like alnylam has to move this toward therapeutic development that takes work and usually collaborative work there is usually not one group that provides a solution in this regard
3952967 many human diseases are caused by the abnormally low expression of proteins and rnaa could be used to treat these disorders through selective transcriptional gene activation
3952968 rnaa is using similar molecules but leveraging a quite different mechanism and offers a complete new platform potentially
3952969 its a slightly earlier stage but here you have the ability to switch on genes selectively or at least thats the vision we have for this so its complementary but represents a quite distinct and alternative platform using rnai molecules
3952970 there has been some degree of controversy about this area but there has been some real progress that has led in part to the development of this ip
3952971 so called anti gene rnas or agrnas appear to increase transcription by complementary base pairing with corresponding promoter sequences which enhance recruitment of the cellular rna polymerase ii and therefore increase the target genes expression
3952972 we felt as a group that wants to play a lead role in this space it was time to pull that ip into our estate and also to collaborate with these folks and develop this science
3952973 i think they want to see their technologies developed and that there is a mutual respect and desire to work together
3952974 by understanding how master transcription factors turn micrornas on and off we now see how these two groups of gene regulators work together to control the state of the cell
3952975 micrornas are a special class of molecules because they not only contribute to cellular control but they play important roles in disease states such as cancer
3952976 knowing where genes start is essential to understanding their control
3952977 based on our knowledge of microrna gene start sites we were able to discover how these genes are controlled by the master transcription factors
3952978 we now have a list of what micrornas are important in embryonic stem cells
3952979 this gives us clues of which micrornas you might want to target to direct an embryonic stem cell into another type of cell for example you might be able to harness a microrna to help drive an embryonic stem cell to become a neuron aiding with neurodegenerative disease or spinal cord injury
3952980 we and others are finding that the overall gene circuitry for embryonic stem cells and cancer cells is very similar
3952981 now that we have connected the circuitry to micrornas we can begin to compare micrornas that are regulated in embryonic stem cells to those in cancer cells

3953007 i was just worried about him and just wanted him to know that we still love him
3953008 we got together in the locker room and gave him a big hug and just told him how we felt about him
3953009 hes too passionate just to give it up like that
3953010 he loves the game he loves the game so much hes going to ride this thing until the wheels fall off ill tell you that
3953011 hes a relentless personality a relentless coach and he just never allows himself to give in to anything
3953012 he attacked this the way he attacks the game and the way he attacks life and didnt let anyone feel sorry for him

3953020 funding costs for the banks across all sources had probably fallen by about 25 to 30 basis points in recent weeks he told a federal parliamentary committee hearing in sydney
3953021 people have been pushing the banks to give more commitment to the fact that they would follow the reserve bank when the reserve bank cuts interest rates
3953022 the banks have responded to that quite cautiously and have been quite non committal
3953023 my guess is really whats happening here is the banks are saying well its unreasonable for them to give commitments when they dont know when the rba is going to move or by how much
3953024 thats why we now find we are in a position to cut interest rates mr battellino added
3953025 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late mr battellino said
3953026 overall when we look at all the evidence which we have its reasonable to conclude that the australian financial sector is competitive and that it stacks up quite well across a range of international benchmarks
3953027 our view is that these recent events are cyclical in nature and do not represent permanent change to the structure of the market in the sense that when markets settle we expect securitisation to pick up again mr battellino said
3953028 the first defendant and the second defendant were notified of the listing today

3953038 it was a public road and the toll was put on it by the previous coalition government
3953039 we did commit in 1995 to remove the toll the contract prevented us from doing that without massive payment from the taxpayers so we introduced cashback
3953040 in 2010 the concession period ends and the toll is scheduled to come off

3953045 selflessly to help improve the lives of the afghan people their spirits will live on in the continued efforts of all who are assisting in the reconstruction of afghanistan
3953046 canada remains steadfast in our commitment to the people of afghanistan and will continue to work with the afghan government and the international community to improve the lives of afghans

3953050 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
3953051 im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen
3953052 i still keep wondering about his birthplace and his birth certificate im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen
3953053 according to some people who know what theyre talking about who are experts on this they say that the birth certificate that hes got on his website and has been posted to the daily kos and some other places is it looks very much like a photoshop deal and doesnt look legit
3953054 t he republican party could file a class action suit against obama demanding that he provide positive proof that he is a bona fide american citizen
3953055 t he last time i filled in for quinn and rose a guy sent me info about his belief that the so called barack obama birth certificate is actually photoshopped
3953056 responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
3953057 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
3953058 i work with digital images all the time and this one looks like its been tampered with
3953059 im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen
3953060 weve found that in all the tests they do tend to favour particular limbs which tends to give them a legs and arms sort of layout
3953061 their front two tentacles will be used for a lot of exploratory work and then the ones immediately behind them will then be used also if further investigation is needed
3953062 then the further back you go the more the limbs are used for propulsion and movement
3953063 from what weve seen all the limbs basically have the same capabilities but they seem to favour this system and it works well for them
3953064 with live prey it does help them when sneaking up with the front limbs ready to pounce and using the back ones for propulsion
3953065 they have that facility unlike humans where if we tried to grab our food with our feet we might fail miserably
3953066 the names pretty good and they would have to rename james bond movies
3953067 octopuses do have very strong personalities they do develop their own favourite toys
3953068 my octopus hates the colour red thats quite a natural response in nature but he particularly likes yellow were starting to build a profile for different octopus
3953069 we wanted objects that would withstand an octopus exploring it but would also stimulate them things that were colourful were helpful
3953070 with a giant pacific octopus which is largest species in the world it had ability to move sections of the rubiks cube
3953071 in the next five to ten years i see more consolidation in every region of the world
3953072 we should expect to see chinese automakers exporting to north america soon as well as european manufacturers bringing their small cars here to manufacture and sell here as well as export back home to take advantage of the weak dollar
3953073 the rest of the regions its going to be more about working with other companies on say platforms or specific deals on buying products
3953074 were not going to be putting any name plate on it until we can be rest assured it meets all of our standards
3953075 that has been the biggest delay in that product program it did not meet our standards
3953076 no one is going to buy a car company like this in the market that its in and expect okay why dont we see if we can go sell it now after one year
3953077 we were not surprised by the fine performance of the liege side we had seen enough of them to know they were a good aggressive side
3953078 the real surprise for me was the way liverpool played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
3953079 we will have to be a lot better in the second leg at anfield much better
3953080 we have been playing well in pre season looking confident and passing the ball well
3953081 but we did not do any of those things i did not want to bring steven gerrard on because the doctors had told me he was not fit enough to start the match
3953082 we waited until well into the second half before using him but we were not controlling the game and i had to bring him on
3953083 this game was far more difficult than we expected and jose reina was the man of the match
3953084 we know we can always rely on pepe to stop penalties but we have been told that the other effort may have been behind the line but these things happen
3953085 liverpool maybe came here asleep and not expecting this sort of game
3953086 maybe though we have woken them up for the second leg which will me much harder for us
3953087 we felt that if we did not lose this first leg we would still be in with a chance we know though that we still have to score and that could be the problem
3953088 into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
3953089 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the ceasefire for the pledge that it undertook
3953090 that will only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
3953091 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3953092 at least 72 hours prior to ships or aircraft crossing the ukrainian border
3953093 may demand that naval ships and aircraft of the black sea fleet leave
3953094 the innovation is aimed at creating serious difficulties for the practical activities of the fleet directly contradicting
3953095 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
3953096 we appeal to all democrats to immediately intervene and put pressure on the govermenent of orissa to release miss pratima mr pradeep and mr amin maharan if he is also arrested without subjecting them to any kind of harassment we demand the government of orissa to immediately release miss pratima das mr pradeep and mr amin maharana and stop harassing mr david pugh mr david pugh is again taken into custody at 2 pm now and being interrogated at bhubaneswar hotel in bhubaneswar by the police officials
3953097 will come up with a new draft on the basis of the sarkozy plan very soon
3953098 this is a very positive development because it indicates that the military logic which prevails until last weekend has now given way to a political logic a diplomatic logic
3953099 to facilitate international discussions as well as to contribute to possible peacekeeping or other arrangements for abkhazia and south ossetia

3953120 as a high school athlete i looked up to jones as a superstar
3953121 it was personally devastating to see it was true i feel a greater responsibility to be clean because it would have been great if my role model could have been clean
3953122 we want to reclaim the image of our sport we all know our sport has taken another unfortunate step backwards i think were all in agreement that its our responsibility to shed some light back on it and we can do that with some amazing performances in beijing that is our top priority
3953123 we must get the blue ribbon event in track and field back to the level where somebody wins on merit
3953124 otherwise we are morally bankrupt we are saying to our kids if you want to succeed fill yourself up with a mouthful of pills otherwise you cant
3953125 while it would be naive for any of us to think there will be no doping during the games i believe we can be sure that with all the progress over these past four years the cheats stand a greater chance of being caught
3953126 its not the first thing that comes to mind so the state of michigan is trying to bring it right to the front of the mind so if you get a dog thats a little ill not running a fever but just isnt doing really well and its still intact you may want to think about drawing a little blood and having it looked at
3953127 when you look at austin as a region it looks not so different from a dallas
3953128 but when you look at austin in its mythology and its inner core its quite different
3953129 they can call themselves austinites even if theyre in williamson county all the way down to onion creek
3953130 they all show up at the erwin center to watch the ut basketball team they all feel an affinity
3953131 everybody jumps on the bandwagon because of so many good things
3953132 we would love to go downtown more but it truly is a hassle
3953133 when we lived in dallas we were in the very northern part of the city but were able to get on light rail and not only go downtown but enjoy the west end and other places we also went to the zoo at the far end of the line
3953134 the media so distorts whats actually going on in a place
3953135 to the outside world it takes on a completely almost artificial character beyond what it really is
3953136 i almost never leave my little quarter mile of the universe during the week and generally only venture out in a vehicle on the weekends for dates with my wife shows etc
3953137 the interesting thing is that austin really does seem to cater to my generation
3953138 but the housing market makes living downtown out of reach for most late 20s professionals
3953139 the exciting part is other parts of the city sometimes even somewhat suburban areas or neighborhoods further out become more interesting
3953140 our partnership with haute market is truly a perfect match everything lined up perfectly october is breast cancer awareness month and we could not think of a better way to kick off the month than to have our fashion show in the middle of the hottest event in town
3953141 the entire haute market staff has been very helpful doing anything they can to assist us for our campaign they have given us access to their years of expertise vendors and newsletter subscribers and we are grateful they decided to partner with us
3953142 it is a great honor to be asked to produce the first why pink fashion show and to be part of this fabulous new campaign
3953143 rome why would anyone want to go there its crowded and dirty youre crazy to go to rome so how are you getting there
3953144 well be at this exclusive little place over on rome s
3953145 dont go any f urther i know that place everybody thinks its gonna be something special and exclusive but its really a dump the worst hotel in the city the rooms are small the service is surly and theyre overpriced so whatcha doing when you get there
3953146 were going to go to see the vatican and we hope to see the pope
3953147 you and a million other people trying to see him hell look the size of an ant boy good luck on this lousy trip of yours youre going to need it
3953148 not only were we on time in one of continentals brand new planes but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class the food and wine were wonderful and i had a handsome 28 year old steward who waited on me hand and foot and the hotel was great theyd just finished a 5 million remodeling job and now its a jewel the finest hotel in the city they too were overbooked so they apologized and gave us their owners suite at no extra charge
3953149 thats all well and good but i know you didnt get to see the pope
3953150 actually we were quite lucky because as we toured the vatican a
3953151 i know who i am im the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude
3953152 just because someone comes up and says something doesnt mean its true
3953153 the credibility of the female witnesses all of whom have faced multiple felony counts of drug and other offenses will play a crucial role in the trial we have a lot of evidence to present
3953154 most of these offenses are aggravating especially when they come from any public official who had imposed upon them the duty of care and trust

3953165 the only reason weve come here is because of a provokazia by mikheil saakashvili
3953166 they killed my neighbours 15 year old son everyone was fleeing in panic
3953167 the russian tanks arrived at our village at 11 20am we ran away we left everything our cattle our house and our possessions
3953168 they were killing burning and stealing my village isnt in a conflict zone its pure georgia
3953169 i believed him when he said there was peace thats why we stayed in our homes but it isnt true
3953170 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
3953171 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
3953172 the question is who is the client is the adviser loyal to income from a foreign client or is he loyal to the candidate he is working for now
3953173 its dangerous if youre getting advice from people who are very close to countries on one side or another of a conflict
3953174 receives no compensation of any type from orion strategies and has not since may 15 2008
3953175 the embassy of georgia requested the call because of georgian concerns over recent russian actions dealing with south ossetia and abkhazia
3953176 scheunemann and others on the foreign policy staff are involved in call requests and statements on foreign policy issues
3953177 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3953178 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
3953179 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions
3953180 its these sorts of appearances of a conflict of interest that are a natural consequence of having a campaign run by lobbyists staffed by lobbyists and being ensconced in a lobbyist culture for over a quarter of a century
3953181 the conduct then was in the defendants scope of employment regardless of whether it was unlawful or contrary to the national security of the united states
3953182 i know that theres going to be a lot of disappointment with this but there is an ongoing criminal proceeding and so our principled stand of not commenting on ongoing legal investigations is going to continue
3953183 i did talk to our counsels office because i forgot that there is a civil case that is pending on this issue i did forget the wilsons have filed a case in civil court it was dismissed and they are on appeal

3953189 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
3953190 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3953191 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3953207 at least we wouldnt have been able to come back to the
3953208 it was supposed to be a picture that inspired the olympic spirit
3953209 the simple question is would stern and the league hold the american players accountable and i think the answer to that is yes
3953210 so why wouldnt he hold the other nba players accountable unless the rules only apply to the american players
3953211 we could say that too but at the end of day we are still representing the nba
3953212 no matter if were saying the actions have nothing to do with it at the end of day we have to go back home and our jobs are there
3953213 it would start an international riot if we did it but they arent us
3953214 its low rent stuff but fiba wont do squat so the nba would show them up with any punitive action i would be shocked if the nba does any more than condemn the action
3953215 you are such a snob when it comes to rednecks
3953216 seriously you cant live your whole life with my last name and be a snob about much especially white trash hell my fathers is the first generation to have all their teeth

3953227 tammy youre a pretty little thing why dont you have a man
3953228 dont worry tam youre gonna get a man real soon
3953229 i didnt see the accident crash but i heard the sound and saw all the people in the big bus get off quickly
3953230 it was a pretty big noise like an explosion i thought some people might think it was a bombing or something thats why all the bus passengers tried to get out and get away
3953231 we asked police what we should do to help they were very panicked and didnt know what to do
3953232 then we saw three australians i dont think they were athletes probably a coach or something because they looked to be in their late 30s and i asked them im from australia is there anything i can do to help you
3953233 they said im ok but can you help me talk to these people inside the mangled mini van because he couldnt speak chinese and he saw some people still alive
3953234 he asked me to tell them to calm down not move and wait for the ambulance
3953235 the big australian guy he didnt mind he felt for their pulse
3953236 its amazing all the other people on the bus got down and tried to get away and there were more than a dozen police around the area but they were all at a loss
3953237 i dont know if chinese police have first aid training or not probably not because they didnt know what to do
3953238 i feel the australians made us proud my son it was the first time he saw real dead people and he said to me oh all the other people have gone its only us australians
3953239 you really feel proud when you see those things they didnt have any thought for their own safety they just wanted to look after injured people
3953240 it was a bit harrowing but you dont think about it too much it was an automatic reaction
3953241 it was pretty bad there were four passengers in the van we opened the door straight away and there was one guy convulsing we could get him out because there were no seats in the back of the van
3953242 the two guys in front of the van were trapped so we couldnt get them so we just made sure they were breathing
3953243 a growing world needs more energy but at the same time we need to find new ways of managing carbon emissions to limit climate change continued investment in technology is one of the key ways we are able to address this challenge and continue to secure a profitable and sustainable future

3953265 im so excited i think were going to surprise some people theres focus and an intensity when youre out there that is unparalleled since ive been here
3953266 i think its almost like a breath of fresh air for him a new start
3953267 it became so stressful for him last year that to have a new beginning and to have a new start to the season is a breath of fresh air its an opportunity to try to put last year behind him
3953268 the whole reason he came back to play was because he is a warrior
3953269 hes tough thats what gets overlooked some times i dont know that people really gave him that respect of trying to play through pain its disappointing the season turned out the way it did and most of it fell on his shoulders
3953270 he has had so many ups and downs and hes handled them all so well he was getting blamed last year for things that werent his fault he would throw an interception but it would be a tackle letting him get hit or the receiver running the wrong route but he shows up every day ready to work very composed he never looks rattled

3953300 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3953301 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3953302 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3953303 as we move forward the united states and europe must review our multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia in light of its actions

3953311 you can go outside and spit and have the same effect as doubling carbon dioxide
3953312 if were to have even a medium sized solar minimum we could be looking at a lot more bad effects than global warming would have had
3953313 the global warming alarm is dressed up as science but it is not science it is propaganda i was horrified to read the ipcc 2nd and 3rd assessment reports because there was so much misinformation
3953314 mosquito species that transmit malaria do not usually survive where the mean winter temperature drops below 16 18 degrees c
3953315 in fact mosquitoes are extremely abundant in the arctic the most devastating epidemic of malaria was in the soviet union in the 1920s there were something like 13 million cases a year and something like 600 000 deaths a tremendous catastrophe that reached up to the arctic circle arkhangel a city 300 miles further north than helsinki finland had 30 000 cases and about 10 000 deaths so its not a tropical disease yet these people in the global warming fraternity invent the idea that malaria will move northward
3953316 they are not going extinct or even appear to be affected
3953317 how could it be determined that so many thermometers were wrong by an average of 0 5 degrees in one particular year several decades ago and an accurate retrofit be made why is the adjustment 0 5 degrees one year and 0 1 degrees the next
3953318 i am baffled by the mann claim that incorrect mathematics doesnt matter because the answer is correct anyway
3953319 not because they were wrong indeed these measurements were made by top scientists including two nobel prize winners using techniques that are standard textbook procedures the only reason for rejection was that these measurements did not fit the hypothesis of anthropogenic global warming i regard this as perhaps the greatest scientific scandal of our time
3953320 the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005 the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650 000 years 180 to 300 ppm as determined from ice cores
3953321 plagued with improper manipulation of data an arbitrary rejection of high readings from old ice and an arbitrary rejection of low readings from young ice simply because they did not fit the preconceived idea of man made global warming
3953322 what frustrates me is the feeling that everything has already been said and published that all rational argument has been used yet it does not help
3953323 trend toward abandoning scientific objectivity in favor of political agendas
3953324 reason environmental extremism emerged was because world communism failed the berlin wall came down and a lot of peaceniks and political activists moved into the environmental movement bringing their neo marxism with them and learned to use green language in a very clever way to cloak agendas that actually have more to do with anticapitalism and antiglobalism than they do anything with ecology or science
3953325 i think if we dont overthrow capitalism we dont have a chance of saving the world ecologically
3953326 the deceit behind the attempts to discredit evidence of climate change reveals matters of importance this deceit has a clear purpose to confuse the public about the status of knowledge of global climate change thus delaying effective action to mitigate climate change the danger is that delay will cause tipping points to be passed such that large climate impacts become inevitable the ones who will live in infamy if we pass the tipping points are the captains of industry ceos in fossil fuel companies such as exxon mobil automobile manufacturers utilities all of the leaders who have placed short term profit above the fate of the planet and the well being of our children

3953330 the terrorist act will not block the launch of our new government

3953332 akhir tahun ini kita akan membahas dengan sejumlah ulama dan fatwa akan diberlakukan secara nasional jika dalam rapat tersebut menyetujui fatwa haram
3953333 ujarnya prevalensi anak merokok di indonesia mencapai tingkat mengkhawatirkan diperkirakan dari 70 juta anak di indonesia
3953334 jumlah itu menjadikan indonesia sebagai negara dengan jumlah perokok terbanyak di asia berdasarkan penelitian global youth tobacco
3953335 tobacco and poverty a vicious cycle atau tembakau dan kemiskinan sebuah lingkaran setan
3953336 peredaran rokok di indonesia kini semakin tidak terkendali dan makin hari para perokok pemula makin berusia muda
3953337 akibatnya peredaran rokok di indonesia tidak terkendali dan itu berbahaya bagi anak anak
3953338 akibatnya sekitar 43 juta anak usia hingga 18 tahun terancam penyakit mematika n
3953339 seharusnya jangan produksi rokok yang dinaikkan tetapi cukai rokok yang dinaikkan sehingga rokok menjadi barang mahal dan tidak bisa dicapai anak anak
3953340 kami juga meminta agar menteri perdagangan mari pangestu red melakukan pembatasan penjualan produk rokok serta membatasi umur orang yang boleh membeli dan mengkonsumsi rokok
3953341 kita belum bisa mengeluarkan fatwa haram karena kita masih mempelajari mudharat lain apabila fatwa rokok haram dikeluarkan
3953342 di negara negara itu tidak ada petani tembakau ataupun pabrik rokok jadi lebih mudah mengeluarkan fatwa haram kalau di indonesia kondisinya seperti itu juga mudah dibuat fatwanya
3953343 dan belanjakanlah harta bendamu di jalan allah dan janganlah kamu menjatuhkan dirimu sendiri ke dalam kebinasaan dan berbuat baiklah karena sesungguhnya allah menyukai orang orang yang berbuat baik
3953344 hai kaumku sembahlah olehmu allah harapkanlah pahala hari akhir dan jangan kamu berkeliaran di muka bumi berbuat kerusakan
3953345 dan janganlah kamu membuat kerusakan di muka bumi sesudah allah memperbaikinya
3953346 dan janganlah kamu merugikan manusia pada hak haknya dan janganlah kamu merajalela di muka bumi dengan membuat kerusakan
3953347 nabi yang ummi yang namanya mereka dapati tertulis di dalam taurat dan injil yang ada di sisi mereka yang menyuruh mereka mengerjakan yang maruf dan melarang mereka dari mengerjakan yang mungkar dan menghalalkan bagi mereka segala yang baik dan mengharamkan bagi mereka segala yang buruk
3953348 dan berikanlah kepada keluarga keluarga yang dekat akan haknya kepada orang miskin dan orang yang dalam perjalanan dan janganlah kamu menghambur hamburkan hartamu secara boros sesungguhnya pemboros pemboros itu adalah saudara saudara syaitan dan syaitan itu adalah sangat ingkar kepada tuhannya

3953359 the trust has great confidence the project will develop in a very active way from later this year

3953374 aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups this year there have been more than 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the past six years the report said
3953375 so far this year 19 ngo non government organization staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
3953376 is definitely increasing and it is spreading to areas where there was relative security last year
3953377 they the taliban do not care about the ordinary people of afghanistan they have their own agenda
3953378 definitely over this year the security situation has been worsening for both the civilians and humanitarian workers
3953379 i couldnt speculate whether they were targeted because they were irc or because they were the first westerners to go through there or were in the wrong place at the wrong time
3953380 i mean all of those things are possible speculations im sure everyone there over the next few days is going to be doing security assessments just basically looking at those questions
3953381 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
3953382 in afghanistan there is a severe drought there is war and the people are being displaced and they need humanitarian assistance
3953383 something has to be done with security by the international community and also from the government of afghanistan
3953384 we anticipate these trends to continue into the next quarter
3953385 with abduction and murder by contracted criminals being the no 1 threat to non governmental organizations

3953397 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states and europe and other nations russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3953398 we expect russia to honour its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance
3953399 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces who have entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3953400 were concerned about reports that russian forces have entered and taken positions in the port city of poti that russian armoured vehicles are blocking access to that port and that russian forces are blowing up georgian vessels
3953401 the border has been along this river for 1 000 years separatist official ruslan kishmaria said

3953406 las leyes que son consultadas de acuerdo con la constituci n ahorita no recuerdo la norma pero es en cuanto a los derechos pol ticos que hablan de la consulta est n referidas a cuando en la discusi n se prev que las mismas van a ser sometidas a consulta una ley cuando va a ser declarada org nica se remite al tsj para que declare acerca de esa situaci n pero si no va a ser org nica no tiene por qu ir al tsj pero en todo caso de estas leyes no ten an que ir a consulta
3953407 hasta ahora lo que yo he podido leer de las mismas no he visto ninguna norma que sea contraria a las disposiciones constitucionales entonces creo que esas afirmaciones son un poco ligeras de se alar en todo caso yo tendr a que terminar de leer las dem s para ver qu se alan
3953408 cuando se ataca de inconstitucional una ley hay que se alar de manera expresa cu l es la norma y d nde est la inconstitucionalidad no basta decir d nde est la inconstitucionalidad sino que hay que se alarlo de manera expresa
3953409 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets

3953414 i asked did you go to help and they looked at me like it was the strangest question dad pretty much did whatever he wanted to do
3953415 the victims of this type of abuse theyre made to believe theyre not worthy of anything that this is what they deserve

3953418 kejayaan kelantan di bawah kepimpinan ulama iaitu tuan guru dato nik abdul aziz nik mat telah berjaya menghapuskan satu ajaran salah yang dianuti rakyat malaysia dan seluruh dunia bahawa ulama tidak layak mentadbir negara
3953419 saya mencadangkan agar pihak lajnah menyediakan kertas lengkap tentang perkara ini beberapa perkara utama perlu diambil perhatian antaranya koordinasi yang lebih baik dengan dewan pemuda pas kita tidak mahu mereka yang melepasi umur 40 tahun atau 58 tahun selepas pencen sahaja yang menyertai dewan ulama pas

3953422 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3953423 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3953424 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3953425 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3953426 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
3953427 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
3953428 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
3953429 i think you can ask the receivers he still has it
3953430 but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3953431 i said look i heard youre not talking to the media
3953432 he said its not that its not that i obviously was joking on that i said look im not here to take chads spot or replace him or whatever it is what it is
3953433 i said this the other day i dont think ive ever beaten chad
3953434 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3953435 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3953436 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3953437 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3953438 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3953439 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3953440 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3953441 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3953442 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3953443 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3953444 saya nggak boleh egois saya punya penggemar toh video klip saya beredar di mana mana dengan baju terbuka juga
3953445 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3953446 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3953447 which is easiest for someone your age to buy cigarettes beer marijuana or prescription drugs such as oxycontin percocet vicodin or ritalin without a prescription
3953448 maybe there should be a lock on the medicine cabinet now
3953449 half of the teenagers were saying they were out on school nights but only 14 percent of the parents knew that they were out
3953450 there are lots of factors at play here parents are not paying attention there are parents who are out in the evening themselves there are parents out at work
3953451 prescription drugs are entrenched and they have not moved for five years and this generation of parents simply do not understand the problem
3953452 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
3953453 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
3953454 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
3953455 this bold experiment is pushing the boundaries and raising many questions
3953456 this study should be enlightening and practice changing for doctors and patients alike
3953457 its a tricky business and it requires a lot of close followup
3953458 you have to talk to people and educate people to expand the possibilities in this field
3953459 you need to go into larger trials for safety and efficacy insmeds limited data appeared to be good data however bioequivalence testing in healthy volunteers does not provide the necessary data on how the biologic actually works in the body which can only be determined through more extensive clinical testing in patients where safety and efficacy are evaluated
3953460 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3953461 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
3953462 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3953463 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3953464 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3953465 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3953466 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3953467 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted
3953468 we expect him to break world records we expect him to win
3953469 i was more or less sort of counting strokes i sort of know how many strokes i take for 50 and i was hoping that i would be dead on
3953470 nggak ada persaingan di sini kita seneng sama sama masuk nominasi

3953472 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3953473 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3953474 tus temas favoritos son los prop sitos del dios eterno su soberan a absoluta su inmutable amor y su gracia distintivo y sin embargo ignoras los preceptos m s claros

3953476 people will be shocked to see that there are areas of the country where fewer than one in eight children sit a levels
3953477 it simply isnt good enough that the educational divide between rich and poor is so wide we want to follow the successful swedish model of reform to make schools accountable to parents giving parents more control will help to improve opportunities for children particularly those from deprived backgrounds
3953478 this back of a fag packet maths adds nothing to the picture on a levels and completely ignores the fact that many youngsters travel between boroughs to do their a levels do other qualifications or work based training or apprenticeships

3953484 you muslims prepare for war and raise the banner of jihad let us shed our blood let our limbs be dismembered until we regain the wise caliphate rule

3953517 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
3953518 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3953519 they were driving in a land cruiser with a clear irc logo on it
3953520 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3953521 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3953522 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3953523 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan
3953524 humanitarian workers should be protected by the principles of neutrality and impartiality and must not be targeted as they appear to be at present in afghanistan
3953525 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3953526 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001

3953537 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3953538 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3953539 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3953540 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem

3953553 people are fighting for their lives and semifinals are horrible places to be really youve got everything to lose and nothing really to gain
3953554 im going to struggle to see everyone else but theyre going to struggle to see me hopefully i can get the slip on the field and they wont know what im up to but if youre fighting it out at the finish you might not be quite in touch with what everyone else is doing

3953648 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
3953649 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye i just find it really disconcerting that people have to focus on the negative and that some people are sooooo bored with their own lives that they need to manifest lies to hurt another person
3953650 he malil didnt stop because he wanted to stop he stopped only because he was interrupted
3953651 this is a difficult but necessary step as a result of continued high fuel costs
3953652 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3953653 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3953654 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3953655 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3953656 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3953657 its one of the largest contiguous blocks of land thats known to have natural gas potential to be sold at one time
3953658 the idea was that this was a one time manna from heaven and we didnt want to go on a spending spree
3953659 we anticipate the value of the roan is going to be severely discounted as a consequence of those actions
3953660 when the governor and environmental groups filed their protest on drilling on the roan plateau theyre protesting a huge revenue source for higher education
3953661 blatant disregard for wildlife and the tens of thousands of citizens who spoke out against oil and natural gas drilling on the roan plateau
3953662 i dont feel comfortable talking about this because it is a complicated issue for the brand
3953663 i dont speak about it to get paid for it
3953664 i speak about it because i love it i understand theyre a family restaurant but i think it cant hurt them to have a little spice
3953665 we cant forbid people from buying it im sure dom perignon or krug would be delighted to have their business
3953666 the question is do you have to love someone who loves you
3953667 said dave balter founder and chief executive of bzzagent a boston based word of mouth media company the answer is a squishy yes and no
3953668 the worst thing to do is turn off someone who is that passionate about you
3953669 a brand doesnt have to actively embrace someone like kendra but they should certainly be willing to accept the fact that shes willing to tell the world how much she loves them
3953670 i think weve frankly gone about as far as we can go
3953671 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3953672 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3953673 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3953674 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3953675 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3953676 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3953677 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3953678 to show to russia that we can come to the aid of a european ally and that we can do it at will whenever and wherever we want
3953679 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can invade its neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3953680 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3953681 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3953682 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3953683 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3953684 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3953685 being an american gives you a passport around the world
3953686 these again are instances of homegrowns who take it to the limit these people wanted to go all the way to iraq
3953687 i am continuing to work to try to bring down the terrorist web sites on the internet
3953688 i think the critical role is reaching out to try to stop the problem in local areas before it starts
3953689 we have a first amendment and we champion the constitution and so in no way shape or form should we engage in censorship of the internet
3953690 its not a substitute for physical field training but it can come close to creating situations on how to train for an urban attack a mall attack
3953691 its somewhat like what some of the 9 11 hijackers used in flight simulation software
3953692 giving parameters as far as race religious views or age groups really misses the point we should be much more sophisticated in the way we approach threats against our country
3953693 investigators arrested them even though they found no guns explosives or targets
3953694 these terrorism acts are trending toward the homegrown self activated self radicalized the sort of thing that could literally pop up in your back yard the typical things we would use to detect terrorism dont work because these people are off the charts so to speak nine times out of ten for the next decade its going to be the local cop who stops the terror attacks
3953695 what are you trying to sell to the local police departments
3953696 would he have succeeded had it not been for the diligence of the jttf
3953697 examine and report upon the facts and causes of violent radicalization homegrown terrorism and ideologically based violence
3953698 build upon and bring together the work of other entities
3953699 the term violent radicalization means the process of adopting or promoting an extremist belief system for the purpose of facilitating ideologically based violence to advance political religious or social change
3953700 law enforcement should focus on action not thought we need to worry about the people who are committing crimes rather than those who harbor beliefs that the government may consider to be extreme
3953701 he went off on a rant against u s foreign policy in the middle east
3953702 we dont ask people for their real names and dont keep track of who attends prayer service
3953703 i dont know why he lied about his real name
3953704 and i dont know why he chose to write down his real name knowing i worked at the berlitz
3953705 i said hold it there what are you talking about
3953706 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3953707 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3953708 ok now what i need you to do now is kind of just put your hands up no higher hmmm ok maybe if you just kinda choke yourself yeah thatll work ok a little harder wait can you breathe alright a little looser ok perfect now
3953709 the best of charles wright and the watts 103rd street
3953710 the noonday demon that attacks the hungry weary soul making us run from gods love in the middle of our days
3953711 no we do not have any of these blueberry rakes in which you speak
3953712 do not let the outsiders acquire one of the holy blueberry rakes they could decimate our crops at night
3953713 will we not covet that which is most important to us
3953714 please dont fight we like both of you but are obligated to protect the weak
3953715 and we are aware that the u s is uptight about this project but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts
3953716 youll never make it as a successful actor if you only do action films
3953717 you plan ahead and are interested in beauty design outward appearance and symmetry you are a person who thinks before acting intelligent and thorough you are diplomatic objective and live in the present you are a talkative person maybe even a busybody you enjoy life in your own way and do not depend on the opinions of others
3953718 if you cant say it in then you shouldnt be saying it at all
3953719 this parking spot is reserved and paid for by davis chiropractic so my patients in pain dont have to walk so far
3953720 tired of seeing the abandoned eyesore on a daily basis artist jennifer marsh decided to cover this old gas station in 5 000 square feet of fabric
3953721 dont be silly stop being mad at what you are mad about
3953722 youre so blinded by the occasional good you refuse see the faults and too busy searching for the faults of the good to notice their loyalty
3953723 cry when you need to smile when you are able to
3953724 there will come a time when this will all be past a memory youll get better it takes time you wait and see
3953725 bale telah menandatangani kontrak baru yang menandakan komitmennya kepada klub hingga tahun 2012
3953726 saya telah meneken kontrak baru saya hari ini secara pribadi sangat senang dan saya berharap telah membuat fans chelsea senang saya telah melewati tujuh musim yang hebat dan sekarang saya punya lebih banyak lagi
3953727 saya merasa yakin saya telah membuat keputusan 100 persen benar bagi diri saya bagi keluarga dan juga klub chelsea ini menjadi kontrak yang sangat penting bagi saya telah berumur 30 tahun dan saya melihat ini telah menjadi kontrak besar terakhir saya
3953728 sleep late have fun get wild drink whiskey and drive fast on empty streets with nothing in mind except falling in love and not getting arrested
3953729 no matter how corrupt greedy and heartless our government our corporations our media and our religious and charitable institutions may become the music will still be wonderful if i should ever die god forbid let this be my epitaph
3953730 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god romans 3 23
3953731 our lord instituted the sacrament of penance for the forgiveness of our sins and for our reconciliation with god but a good confession brings us more than forgiveness of our sins it also provides us with a powerful grace filled means to
3953732 people are more sensitive to fuel prices in the summer than at other times of year
3953733 we have a higher percentage of discretionary driving in the summer vacation plans more weekend trips maybe a trip to the beach
3953734 as gas prices slide back people will react for sure
3953735 many will stick with changes theyve made but that will be a small percentage most of these folks as soon as they get the opportunity to go back to where they were before they will
3953736 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3953737 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3953738 everybody is trying to figure out what do we do going forward
3953739 declaration of the peoples sovereignty and intent to wrest unlawful control of the government of the united states of america from traitors
3953740 you can kill someone just as dead by accident as on purpose
3953741 kamu ummat islam adalah ummat terbaik yang dilahirkan untuk manusia karena kamu menyeru kepada yang maruf dan mencegah dari yang munkar dan beriman kepada allah
3953742 dan hendaklah ada di antara kamu segolongan ummat yang menyeru kepada kebajikan menyuruh berbuat maruf dan mencegah dari yang munkar dan
3953743 ketika banyak orang mengaku cinta kepada allah maka mereka diminta menunjukkan bukti atas keseriusan cintanya itu jika semua orang diterima alasannya maka boleh jadi orang yang tidak memiliki apa apa akan mengaku bahwa kain yang sobek sobek adalah miliknya
3953744 pagi dan siang hari di jalan allah adalah lebih baik daripada dunia seisinya
3953745 tidak ada yang kamu tunggu tunggu bagi kami kecuali salah satu dari dua kebaikan dan kami menunggu nunggu bagi kamu bahwa allah akan menimpakan kepadamu azab yang besar dari sisi nya atau azab dengan tangan kami sebab itu tunggulah sesungguhnya kami menunggu nunggu bersamamu
3953746 dan sungguh kalau kamu gugur di jalan allah atau meninggal tentulah ampunan allah dan rahmat nya lebih baik bagimu daripada harta rampasan yang mereka kumpulkan
3953747 two men robbed the police station and took all the toilets the police have nothing to go on
3953748 send this on to 9 of your blah blah blah
3953749 new york gave me my words and my music and rock and roll gave me a place for that music to live
3953750 there really isnt a more fitting spot for this museum than new york the hometown of hall of famers like the velvet underground paul simon and blondie this is where ed sullivan met the beatles where lou reed took a walk on the wild side
3953751 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
3953752 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
3953753 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
3953754 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
3953755 aku mengincar olimpiade ini sejak lama aku merasa istimewa di olimpiade athena kini aku merasa istimewa lagi
3953756 ive built a quiet confidence within myself where the most nerve racking part was this right here the press conference
3953757 and that more than anything was just because we didnt have that
3953758 i could tell right away when he walked through my office door that there was chemistry and that we were speaking the same language
3953759 i feel that my experience in providence will help me
3953760 we didnt have the team that anybody wouldve picked to win the amount of games that we did
3953761 it didnt just take coaching xs and os it took the players buying into the system that we play and being accountable to each other thats kind of the last step in my development as a coach in refining the team chemistry part of it how to get the guys to want to play for each other
3953762 i apologized to him and i apologized to my teammates
3953763 i told him that hes one of our leaders here and theres no reason for that
3953764 weve got pitchers who can do that to the other team too
3953765 they do that to us why cant we do that to them
3953766 you have to live with that stuff its been around since the beginning of the game
3953767 while republicans against 8 will draw support from log cabin members across the country it falls to us here in california to help execute the campaigns ground game early polls look promising but victory is not assured we need your help to safeguard the freedom to marry
3953768 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3953769 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3953770 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3953771 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3953772 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3953773 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3953774 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3953775 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3953776 i remember asking her mom whats wrong with your knees
3953777 we didnt want you to speak indian because we didnt want you to be punished we didnt want you to have to crawl across the floors and scrub floors
3953778 the last thing she did was she started singing indian
3953779 it justified all the bad things that were happening to indian people i knew we had to continue
3953780 i got up and spoke about the terrible conditions for american indian people
3953781 there was absolutely nothing to make our children feel good
3953782 today they are digging us up all over the western hemisphere they have never found a prison or a guillotine it must have been a great civilization they found out that indian people had no trace of alcohol
3953783 we chose to make that change by standing on our treaty rights
3953784 now indian people are making compacts with the states giving up treaty rights for casinos
3953785 we dont have to worry about the government anymore we are terminating ourselves
3953786 they didnt give us nothing everything that white america got they got from us
3953787 as long as the rivers flow the grass grows and the sun shines
3953788 all the gold in fort knox comes from indian land
3953789 we got them off welfare rolls and put them on payrolls
3953790 we had to create our own institutions even today we can do that all across america
3953791 it is not a walk or run across america when the prayers are over it is time to roll up the sleeves and get to work
3953792 the creator is not going to help you unless you help yourself
3953793 there was a time when everything was done through prayer through a ceremony through a song
3953794 creator to watch over us and mother earth to provide for us
3953795 the american indian movement said we will never give up another inch of our land and we will fight for everything we have lost
3953796 you just have to be who you are fight and struggle defend the treaty rights
3953797 we are still at war we are going to unite and we are going to work together to fight injustice
3953798 all i cold think about was when i get out of jail im going to go to a sundance
3953799 if you try to do something they will put you in jail you had better go talk to the warriors the sundancers

3953809 n o estamos em 1968 a r ssia n o pode fazer o que quiser invadir um pa s e sair impune
3953810 os ataques russos foram al m da quest o da oss tia do sul eles bombardearam gori e destruiram a infra estrutura georgiana e por isso que a comunidade internacional e os eua falam de conseq ncias
3953811 um projeto especial dos eua e entendemos que os eua est o preocupados com o seu projeto
3953812 n s reagimos pois n o t nhamos outra op o qualquer pa s civilizado teria feito o mesmo
3953813 eu posso lembr los o 11 de setembro a rea o foi semelhante cidad os americanos foram mortos voc s sabem a rea o
3953814 the three people died following the discovery of dead poultry but we dont know whether or not it avian influenza was the cause
3953815 we have seen more and more russian troops coming into the area all day a continuous build up of forces including columns of tanks and truck all along the roads here
3953816 they came into this area and destroyed six georgian vessels
3953817 from what we understand they came with the specific task of destroying all the military facilities of the georgians
3953818 poti is one of the most important ports in the black sea
3953819 the offensive means that the ceasefire is dead back to ground zero
3953820 no more than 100 metres away is an armoured personnel carrier with three russian soldiers on top behind that there is a long convoy of russian military vehicles
3953821 the fact russian forces have moved so far into georgian territory will be seen as an act of provocation
3953822 theyre not moving at a fast speed but they are moving towards tbilisi
3953823 it is only 60km from gori to tbilisi but this doesnt look like an invasion force
3953824 this seems to have overstepped the bounds of the russian side of the ceasefire they had pledged not to move from their positions and to stop firing
3953825 these are disturbing developments given all the work that was done by the eu yesterday
3953826 we have heard from our colleagues on the ground that this isnt the case
3953827 russian occupying forces were continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
3953828 georgian forces have begun their pullback towards tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3953829 we are still obliged to fulfil our mission by taking out firing positions snipers and so on
3953830 i myself saw three personnel carriers on the edge of the town but there was no doubt they were moving towards gori
3953831 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
3953832 upon the withdrawal of georgian troops to their barracks russian troops will return to the territory of the russian federation
3953833 balkan type and world war ii type ethnic cleansing and purification campaigns
3953834 we are getting reports of large scale violation of human rights of the worst of the case
3953835 the town of tskhinvali was turned into grozny two by russian carpet bombardment and i really want people to go in and check and verify what kind of bombs are these
3953836 i have been hearing accusation that this was georgian bombing and this is not true
3953837 really at the heart of my concern is that we shouldnt wait for a definitive study to come out but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later
3953838 some web firms say they track behavior without explicit consent
3953839 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it as a commodity to other providers
3953840 our responsibility is to make sure that we create a law that regardless of the technology includes a set of legal guarantees that consumers have with respect to their information
3953841 insight into the number of people who have seen an ad campaign
3953842 how many users visited their sites after seeing an ad
3953843 google is slowly embracing a full blown behavioral targeting over its vast network of services and sites
3953844 people are starting to see oh we have these different industries that are collecting the same types of information to profile individuals and the devices they use on the network
3953845 internet cellphones cable any way you tap into the network concerns are raised
3953846 a broad approach to protecting peoples online privacy seems both desirable and inevitable
3953847 advertisers and data collectors who record where customers go and what they do want profit at the expense of privacy
3953848 cant be singing louder than the guns when im gone so i guess ill have to do it while im here
3953849 because there are so many early september premieres this year were running our fall preview before labor day and i know nothing
3953850 its a huge problem for me and i know for a lot of other critics
3953851 particularly since no one has even hinted at when we might get them
3953852 its next to impossible to plan or write anything useful when were working blind like this
3953853 hundreds of thousands of dollars in dubbing and shipping costs its an enormous monetary savings
3953854 we start with cbs the only network to deliver you a bunch of pilots to watch in advance
3953855 half of the press tour was a waste because we hadnt seen the shows
3953856 i cant imagine writing a single thing based on any of the panels for nbcs new shows
3953857 were at a point where were writing descriptions for readers about shows weve only talked about
3953858 but we are also pros and we can fairly review rough cuts presentations and shows with cast changes
3953859 ive never had a situation like this fall where i dont have a shows pilot yet the good part is weve got a strong solid script we understand the tone and style and where its going but we want to make sure were promising something that the show delivers
3953860 i would put chelsea manchester united and liverpool as favourites again to win the premier league but regarding arsenal they also have a great team but im not sure if the group have enough experience and quality to win
3953861 i see nobody else to win the premier league but tottenham surely have the quality to fight for a top four finish
3953862 i cannot really say who the surprise team will be but year after year we always wait for a better newcastle
3953863 they are a top club they have huge support and they have good players so we wait for more from them
3953864 phil scolari has not made a lot of changes since he arrived at the club
3953865 he has kept the same structure the same system and the same football he is a good leader and he can do very well
3953866 im just excited knowing that asjha is going to be here for the next several years
3953867 what shes done to become a prime time player in this league is terrific shes done everything you could ask a player to do to become a leader and a go to player shes going to be an all star for a long long time shes a major reason for why we are where we are

3953875 quiet down neil what sort of thing is well like that
3953876 ah ha you dont know everything after all we could use a tv antenna
3953877 we can just take the one off the tv downstairs the farmer can go without his televison
3953878 no no we cant that guy isnt very nice and weve got no place else to hide if he kicks us out

3953893 depending on the severity of the case well put them on a suicide watch until we can get them hooked up or get them with the jail psychiatrist
3953894 he was doing what every other teenager would be doing
3953895 if we do not i can almost promise you nrg is going to be tired of the city and say were trying to give you some canals
3953896 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3953897 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3953898 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3953899 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3953900 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3953901 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3953902 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3953903 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly
3953904 i get tired of cops always having an attitude right off the bat
3953905 its not like i robbed anybody to have that attitude with me when all i did was cuss
3953906 you just cant go off swearing and hollering you just cant do it
3953907 certainly the death penalty could be sought in every capital case tried but that would clearly be a decision made without regard to thought of anything other than emotions
3953908 it makes no sense but points out even more so why we must look at case law in our evaluation process
3953909 an offense report was not written on this situation and an arrest was not made
3953910 however a citation was written and that is not public record under rule 12
3953911 the document is presumed open to the public unless sealed by court order
3953912 the next time you hear from me about the vice presidential selection process will be when i have selected a vice president
3953913 have moved to better than 50 50 and we have the announcement of convention speakers launching a new round of guessing games
3953914 i think it all boils down to the consumerist culture our happiness depends on material consumption singaporeans operate first and foremost as consumers and then as citizens
3953915 i think we have achieved a certain standard of quality of life even if we cut down our spending in consumption patterns i dont think it would affect us materially or in any way at all
3953916 consumerism doesnt have to be unsustainable the question is how we introduce sustainability into consumption patterns so that we consume at a sustainable rate
3953917 we have a limited amount of needs but an unlimited amount of wants no matter how much resource we have at our disposal it is impossible to satisfy all our wants
3953918 it is usually this futility of trying to achieve the impossible that cause unhappiness
3953919 i think that many of us including myself are guilty of printing lecture and tutorial notes can you imagine the amount of paper used after each semester
3953920 what happens to this paper i doubt all of us will bring it to the recycling bin
3953921 if you happened to walk around in nus at night all the lights and fans in canteens are not switched off even when there are almost no students this happens in some classrooms and lecture halls during the day as well
3953922 i think its a question of habit and practice it is difficult if one wants to change habits that have already been established
3953923 singaporeans actually have good environmental attitudes its just that they dont practise what they believe in
3953924 you either have to put in very strong incentives and disincentives or very strong kind of persuasive efforts by groups of people in order to enforce a certain change
3953925 nus students have too many things on their minds i dont think actual changes will be seen today but hopefully as these messages keep appearing they will become more aware of the issues involved
3953926 configure r6 to send its logged access list hits to this device 129 x 46 100

3953930 this study should be enlightening and practice changing for doctors and patients alike

3953937 weve featured several artists and record labels representing various genres and look forward to announcing more live fyi performances very soon
3953938 i think were definitely on the right track as a team
3953939 of course ken lucas played a big part in that
3953940 guys are still working and still battling and i think that is a great sign
3953941 like always there are always tougher times than others but i think we worked through everything pretty well i like this group so far
3953942 i think were definitely on the right track as a team
3953943 of course ken lucas played a big part in that
3953944 guys are still working and still battling and i think that is a great sign
3953945 like always there are always tougher times than others but i think we worked through everything pretty well i like this group so far
3953946 until i hear anything else thats the way im looking at it right now
3953947 im focusing on football until i hear anything else ill assume its over
3953948 until i hear anything else thats the way im looking at it right now
3953949 im focusing on football until i hear anything else ill assume its over
3953950 no matter what anybody says theres going to be people who automatically assume guilty until proven innocent which is sort of a tough pill to swallow
3953951 now that its over or seems to be over im trying to move on past it
3953952 i apologized to him and i apologized to my teammates
3953953 i told him that hes one of our leaders here and theres no reason for that
3953954 weve got pitchers who can do that to the other team too
3953955 they do that to us why cant we do that to them
3953956 you have to live with that stuff its been around since the beginning of the game
3953957 i apologized to him and i apologized to my teammates
3953958 i told him that hes one of our leaders here and theres no reason for that
3953959 weve got pitchers who can do that to the other team too
3953960 they do that to us why cant we do that to them
3953961 you have to live with that stuff its been around since the beginning of the game

3953969 there always used to be a particular city that was the centre of cool at a particular point in time
3953970 but now theres no longer a place where its at theres no longer any centre of the worlds popular cultural universe for a time it seemed it would be a simple matter of shifting from london to tokyo but instead street style is everywhere and in places youd never have guessed it would be
3953971 the ultra contemporary cool aspect of japan its pop culture rather than something traditional and japanese y
3953972 fuzzed garage punk post punk freakbeat and more in an anything goes night of really good music
3953973 people like ryan mcginley and terry richardson just took pictures of their friends on basic cameras
3953974 american apparel and uniqlo are doing what vice did which is to stop using expensive models and photoshop they use point and shoot photography which is more honest and exciting cheap digital cameras and the internet popularised that
3953975 theyre now transmitted laterally and collaboratively via the internet you once had a series of gatekeepers in the adoption of a trend the innovator the early adopter the late adopter the early mainstream the late mainstream and finally the conservative but now it goes straight from the innovator to the mainstream
3953976 were more of a news magazine than a fashion magazine
3953977 even if were writing about a band we try to put some social context in it were the economist meets rolling stone but back when rolling stone was good
3953978 in 2008 the only prevailing trend is that there are no prevailing trends
3953979 its not just designers who are contributing to the end of boldface trends consumers too are rejecting the commandments of the editorial elite taking inspiration from peers around the world to craft their own interpretations of style rather than buy into one trend from head to toe like the preppy or punk movements of decades past consumers are appropriating eclectic influences and remixing them like a dj does with music
3953980 its pick and mix its retroactive and its nostalgic so you get a chronological misfit of products and references mashed together to create something completely different think about nu rave its a product of eighties romanticism a product of punk a product of straight edge and of old rave the growth in cool hunting websites and businesses has led to the decay of the traditional time scheme between an emerging group doing something and it being spotted embraced and codified it used to be a year then it was six months now its about six days we have 3 500 trend spotters stationed around the world i sit down with them four times a year and well find that the same trend has cropped up in about 25 different cities
3953981 i dont have my press badge but you messing with my money and its gon get serious if you dont let me in to get my pictures
3953982 its pretty pathetic when the only thing saving someone from disconnection is being flooded out
3953983 they were so excited theyre rvers so they can go anywhere on the road find a computer go into the phoenix public library catalogue download a book and play it while they drive down the highway
3953984 see what george bush is doing to fix our economy
3953985 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3953986 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3953987 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3953988 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3953989 of the 18 faith groups identified in the polls mccain is only leading among evangelicals and its a narrow lead obama leads among the other 17 faith groups identified including the born again vote barna notes that would mark the first time in more than two decades that the born again vote has swung toward the democratic candidate
3953990 the underlying premise is that before you go into someones home you need a warrant
3953991 there are exceptions such as chasing someone or if some harm is coming to someone in the house but in this situation there was no emergency clearly they would have been granted a warrant but they did not feel like taking the time to do it
3953992 its not that uncommon for the spouse of a seriously ill person to commit adultery
3953993 the healthy spouse often feels guilty lonely and helpless about the illness and that combination can make a spouse more vulnerable to having an affair
3953994 i know edwards spoke of his narcissism as a factor but far more than that had to be going on
3953995 his wife took care of him three or four times a week but she was in her 50s and was still a young person
3953996 some cave in and feel victimized and others say screw it and fight and win
3953997 not only are you losing your body parts and vitality but also losing what you perceive to be your dreams your family and your social status
3953998 its very difficult for someone like elizabeth edwards to leave in this situation
3953999 she has a high investment in maintaining that relationship she may submerge a great deal political wives do they have an investment in the political arena as well
3954000 i am not sure what the word forgiveness means but they never forget
3954001 there is something about a lot of the people in power that they think the rules no longer apply to them or theyre above the rules
3954002 they have a sense of entitlement that comes with their prestige or place in the political sphere
3954003 when youre powerful you get away with a lot of things
3954004 and when youre attractive youre given a lot of slack thats just how the world works
3954005 there is a euphoria attached to the relentless feeding of the ego
3954006 the grandiosity in their own mind tends to make them so vain that an illusion of invincibility is created
3954007 if there is no meaningful consequence of what hes done typically change will not happen
3954008 if he loses power or a job or there is legal intervention then he might
3954009 going on television says two things one that he cant hide anymore because he was up against the wall and two that narcissists are always thinking about themselves and their appearance to the audience
3954010 edwards may just be thinking that the best way to preserve his ego is to take some ownership and give his behavior a title by saying hes narcissistic
3954011 by putting a diagnostic label on it might be another way of not taking responsibility
3954012 to curtail some of the general mayhem weve been experiencing particularly the gun shots
3954013 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3954014 the new rules take decision making on endangered species listings out of the hands of scientists and wildlife professionals at agencies such as the u s fish and wildlife services and instead put those decisions in the hands of agencies working on projects that may be adversely affected by a listing
3954015 widespread exploitation of cheap temporary workers in their plants along with a parts supply chain that is riddled with sweatshop abuses including human trafficking
3954016 right now toyota and the u s auto companies are locked in a race to the bottom which will inevitably lead them to adopt each others worst practices
3954017 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
3954018 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
3954019 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
3954020 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
3954021 at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault

3954026 these non traditional venues are stubbornly entrenched incredibly popular and will never go away
3954027 its time to stop swimming against the tide of what people want
3954028 people are more likely to act habitually say using pirate bay than to break their habit say visiting www inrainbows com
3954029 not only are we not part of the union were not even allowed to play with the colonies were even discriminated among the non self governing territories of the us
3954030 its all part of the colonial mentality of accepting things the way they are
3954031 tonya hardings lawyers got the olympic committee to roll over can you imagine jesse jackson and jack kent cooke working in concert you talk about the morality of tonya harding being allowed to compete in the olympics how about the immorality of dc not being allowed to compete

3954037 there is little indication that the greens will have any major impact on the 08 election

3954044 oh yeah theyre still in the picture i dont want to leave them out
3954045 i havent heard from them maybe they want something that i dont have but i cant worry about that im happy with what i have as far as offers
3954046 im just trying to see what everyone has to offer aside from basketball im trying to see what schools really want me or need me
3954047 with the way my parents and family are there will be no problems with grades
3954048 my ball handling and my mid range jumper are coming along
3954049 im more than just a high flyer and thats what ive been labeled as it motivates me if people back off me if i can show them that i can hit that open shot or bring the ball up court and dish it being able to do that thats what motivates me

3954059 a lot of my friends went straight to the work force after high school in those days you could actually go to some of the plants you could actually have a career you could send your kids to school

3954064 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3954065 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3954066 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3954067 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3954068 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3954069 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3954070 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3954071 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3954072 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3954073 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3954074 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3954075 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3954076 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3954077 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3954079 en une semaine il sest produit des impulsions lectriques spontan es et qui paraissait tre une activit dun cerveau ordinaire
3954080 nous avons utilis cette r action pour relier le cerveau au robot avec des lectrodes
3954081 maintenant nous tudions comment lui apprendre en augmentant le voltage sur diff rents lectrodes et en utilisant des produits chimiques pour favoriser ou stopper les transmissions entre neurones
3954082 nous voulons comprendre comment les souvenirs sont archiv s dans un cerveau biologique par rapport un cerveau dordinateur
3954083 a lheure actuelle nous estimons quil y a 50 000 100 000 neurones en activit dans le cerveau de gordon
3954084 comme dans le cas de lhomme si le cerveau de gordon nest pas stimul r guli rement il se laisse aller alors quavec des stimulations les connexions se renforcent il semble devenir plus alerte

3954100 obviously eamon and i are great friends and i support him as much as he supports me
3954101 when my friends at school heard the news of me going to the olympics they thought i was playing a joke on them
3954102 the growing redirection of olympic gold medals is because the old disparities between competitive sports levels due to historical and economic causes is being constantly overturned
3954103 this also means the traditional sporting powers face stronger and stronger challengers
3954104 what is important is to show china and to show beijing to the whole world

3954119 mr suskind reports that the bush administration in its pursuit of war created and promoted forged documents about iraq
3954120 i am particularly troubled that the decision to disseminate this fabricated intelligence is alleged to have come from the highest reaches of the administration the administrations attempt to challenge mr suskinds reporting appears to have been effectively dismissed by the publication of the authors interview recordings and transcripts i have instructed my staff to conduct a careful review of mr suskinds allegations and the role played by senior administration officials in this matter

3954155 became convinced that natural gas had a number of advantages over gasoline and diesel as a vehicle fuel
3954156 natural gas is already an inexpensive and extremely available fuel in most states it only costs about 1 per gallon then you have oil in the united states including new reserves in alaska and the gulf that we werent previously allowed to drill into demand for foreign oil would be down thus lowering the price significantly if pickens plan comes into effect i expect to see gas prices to be about the same as they were in 1990 1 51 per gallon and natural gas prices heavily inflated by tax to be about the same price we could also perhaps see additional taxation on gas and natural gas maybe somewhere to the tune of fifty cents per gallon to help alleviate the cost of building a bunch of wind mills to power our homes even with that additional tax 2 00 per gallon sure sounds a lot better than 4 15

3954260 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3954261 as we move forward the united states and europe must review our multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia in light of its actions
3954262 im interested in good relations between the united states and russia

3954267 for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict

3954285 troops are carefully clearing the areas slowly and inch by inch to really ensure that no explosives are left behind
3954286 we have complied with the agreement between the cease fire committees to reposition our forces to avoid further clashes

3954303 there was a maintenance issue involving the lubrication of a jack screw on a boeing 747 400 qantas found this through a routine check of our maintenance records

3954356 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3954357 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3954358 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3954359 there are lots of problems with the river murray but lack of environmental flows is without a doubt the biggest one we need to have much bigger environmental flows passing down there through the coorong and out the mouth a healthy river should be able to keep its own mouth open and shouldnt need any sort of dredging or artificial assistance in keeping sand out of its mouth
3954360 australian rivers fall rapidly from the mountains in which they originate into a level and extremely depressed country having weak and inconsiderable sources and being almost wholly unaided by tributaries of any kind they naturally fail before they reach the coast and exhaust themselves in marshes or lakes or reach it so weakened as to be unable to preserve clear or navigable mouths or to remove the sand banks that the tide throws up before them
3954361 we had at length arrived at the termination of the murray immediately below me was a beautiful lake which appeared to be a fitting reservoir for the noble stream that had led us to it and which was now ruffled by the breeze that swept over it
3954362 the transition from fresh to salt water was almost immediate
3954363 the stillness of the night was broken by the roar of the ocean now too near to be mistaken for wind or by the silvery and melancholy note of the black swans as they passed over us to seek food no doubt among the slimy weeds at the head of the lake
3954364 shoals again closed in upon us on every side we dragged the boat over several and at last got amongst quicksands
3954365 imbalances in the way water has been shared between murray darling basin states
3954366 now this is storytelling anthony lawton holds us rapt you can feel the intensity of the audiences attention with his masterful performance in the great divorce each character comes to life through lawtons voice as he walks that fine line between the dramatic and the narrative he brings the old fashioned very literary vocabulary to life

3954370 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
3954371 to somehow suggest obama is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in montana running for president is absurd
3954372 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight
3954373 he wont appreciate the history of what is happening here until later maybe years later
3954374 the board has accepted the resignation of paul battershill effective immediately as a result of a loss of confidence in his leadership of the police department
3954375 we felt that under the circumstances the 15 000 cost for his legal fees was appropriate
3954376 its now up to the office of the police complaints commissioner to review the findings and determine if a public hearing is warranted
3954377 the process with the police act is still under way
3954378 resignations basically remove any claims the employee may have for severance or restitution
3954379 and once the employer accepts the resignation theyre hard pressed to make any claims against the employee
3954380 its almost half the house every single one of those people arent going to have the same list

3954390 capping participation and adding new areas for bonuses are not a tweak to the current procomp program
3954391 procomp isnt just a pay system it was designed to help change the culture of schools providing incentives to encourage teachers and principals to collaborate on setting goals meeting student needs and engaging in professional development
3954392 parents and the public have a stake in this debate about the future of procomp since they voted to support it with their tax dollars
3954393 if it is going to be dramatically changed they should know what the impact will be on teachers and schools throughout the city

3954406 we previously had terms they had to be renegotiated until they were renegotiated the deal wasnt going to go forward

3954411 everyone has their own opinion of what i should do but i think that its my life
3954412 i know there might be wrong decisions that i make and there might be right decisions that i make but theyre decisions that i make for myself
3954413 and i think the only decision i can make is to be 100 per cent supportive of myself and not doubt myself at all
3954414 i think planning whats going to happen next year or this autumn is going to happen after this week
3954415 right now all im thinking about is how am i going to play good this week how am i maybe going to possibly win this
3954416 im not going to think about the future right now
3954417 i kind of feel sad for the guidance that she seems to not have in the right direction if she wants to be a golfer she should really concentrate on being on the womens tour and dealing with them and learning to win
3954418 if i will come back in the future i guess time will tell
3954419 i never used the r word that gave me an opening but i dont have a timeframe i have a lot on my plate and im excited about the next chapter
3954420 we stood up well because we were so young in the middle of the park
3954421 of course for a game of that level you could be worried but i have confidence in them and i must say i have been paid back very well
3954422 we expected a difficult game and we were not disappointed they man marked us all over the pitch and we needed to be patient and not make any mistakes at the back
3954423 we changed a bit tactically at half time but most important they dropped their level a bit to do what they did in the first half to tackle for every ball is of course very difficult and from then on we looked a bit more comfortable
3954424 its a massive mountain to climb its bigger than everest but we take heart from the performance
3954425 i said before that this game isnt just about now but also the future i like what i see of this team we showed we are a good team who can compete with the likes of arsenal
3954426 we go away thinking 2 0 is an unbelievable result because of the performance we put in
3954427 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half
3954428 that anyone could come into the school after hours and take advantage of defenceless animals that have been lovingly cared for by our students is disappointing
3954429 there will be consequences for the students according to their level of involvement
3954430 the college has put procedures in place to manage the wellbeing of all students

3954436 the pool provides camera shots inside the convention halls and can be used by any cooperating read paying entity a network insider tells tvnewser its really as simple as drawing straws about which network will be the pool for a certain event since nbc and fnc will be pool for the conventions the other networks will likely be the pool for other events including next falls debates
3954437 the pool is there to provide standard shots especially shots of the podium there is no need and actually no room on the camera stands for each network to provide their own camera to give the same unmoving shot of the speaker more importantly each network provides its own cameras for its own shots and each network does its own production choosing when to use its own shots and when to use the pool shots also the pool does not provide any graphics commentary or anything close to any editorial discretion theres really no way that fox providing the pool coverage could affect how the convention is covered

3954461 stephen jay gould occupies a rather curious position particularly on his side of the atlantic because of the excellence of his essays he has come to be seen by non biologists as the pre eminent evolutionary theorist in contrast the evolutionary biologists with whom i have discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with but as one who should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side against the creationists

3954476 was subject to fairly intense pressure by obama advisers to allow the team of eric holder and caroline kennedy to open an account and begin their work
3954477 dramatic turns of event could still spell unexpected trouble or prosperity for either candidate in florida or elsewhere but for now obama simply isnt ginning up quite enough support in florida to turn all eyes to the state as the tiebreaker in november the likely reason is demographics
3954478 hes on third base but so far he cant seem to find a way to get home look at the underlying trends the economy is a huge issue bushs ratings are terrible but too many voters are concerned about obamas experience and dont yet have enough confidence in his ability to lead
3954479 was a high profile figure in the investigation of former lobbyist jack abramoff although he was never charged with any wrong doing his ties to abramoffs lobbying schemes unearthed in a series of high profile senate indian affairs committee hearings chaired by mccain came at a political price the relationship and ensuing backlash against the republican party on corruption issues is widely credited with costing him the 2006 republican primary in georgias gubernatorial race
3954480 how shocking is it that ralph reed the former gop boy wonder who was jack abramoffs business partner is helping to raise money for mccain for a fundraiser next week in atlanta its amazing marriage of convenience one that some in mccain world may believe is a step too far in fact what are the odds that reed actually shows up to this mccain event

3954485 seem almost interchangeable in fact it was hard to find a mention of john mccain on either of them obama dominates both sites pretty much equally
3954486 two things in particular seem to drive the size of the bumps
3954487 it should be clear that the magnitude of the convention bump is not a great predictor of election outcomes

3954496 commissioner goodell told jones that his continued participation in the nfl depends on demonstrating that he can conduct himself in a lawful and reliable manner
3954497 jones will be expected to continue the personal conduct program established by the nfl and the cowboys and to avoid further adverse involvement with law enforcement
3954498 i like him hes a competitive player that can make big shots and one of those guys that is capable of rising to important times and obviously we want to be playing in those times
3954499 all these guys are very excited they respect mo as a player and theyre looking forward to playing with him
3954500 i think this is a move to be able to get a talented young 25 year old point guard that can be part of the future said ferry who added that restricted free agent delonte west remains in the teams plans even with the trade
3954501 his most productive days in the nba were just a few short years ago when he had ray allen on one wing and rashard lewis on the other wing hammond said
3954502 here you say you have michael redd on one wing and richard jefferson on another wing youre putting luke ridnour in the best possible position to be successful again as he has been in the past
3954503 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back
3954504 we understand that its a unique opportunity here specifically but weve got to do the best thing for our basketball team and we feel like the best thing for our basketball team is to add some toughness and some intangibles defensively for us at that position presti said
3954505 just to not make him play especially when i was serving for that first set
3954506 i was really looking forward to the match haas said
3954507 set point for him match point for me it went so long there were long rallies and some amazing balls
3954508 it was a very good sensation said falla into his first quarterfinals since october
3954509 i said to myself that looked a lot like no
3954510 when you hear it from a guy like mr dorsett it touches you
3954511 ive watched lots of nfl teams and nba teams talked to some coaches and ive found a common thread there that will benefit us
3954512 its basically doing what you do process who we are making sure that you dont change the recipe on a team thats had success not only in one year but in many years thats where were at
3954513 i hear people talking about it but im not worried
3954514 ive seen what these guys can do i trust them
3954515 you cant downplay the loss of charles alexander i think he was playing extremely well at the beginning of the year and unfortunately we didnt have ricky throughout the whole season
3954516 that hurt us and i dont know if a lot of people understand the significance of losing those two players up front

3954521 mark is one of those what do you call them self realization guys
3954522 some coaches get so wrapped up in what theyre doing in doing things their way and not changing it becomes counterproductive part of mark i think was concerned could that be happening to me
3954523 only somebody in the crowd thought i meant everybody and everybody went
3954524 but when i saw that exuberance when i saw that energy when i saw the passion and the fire get unleashed that had been dormant in this football team i got excited i got fired up
3954525 i could just tell there was something special about the kid

3954533 so todd and sarah are scratching their heads saying why is this guy representing the department hes a horrible recruiting tool you know so from their perspective everybodys protecting him audi probably disagrees with me walt monegan does and i understand its really touchy but i just want you to understand that cops that use excessive force or go out of the lines they just have no tolerance because theyve seen the facts personally
3954534 they have a different type of offense and a different type of defense
3954535 we get a chance to work against a 3 4 look and they get a chance to take a look at a four man front
3954536 normally by that third week of practice you get tired of hitting against each other
3954537 this is a good change up for both teams where you get a chance to go against different schemes and different people
3954538 it was a good opportunity for our team to come and work with the broncos and we all know that they are a class organization
3954539 a lot of clubs have workouts together and it is big fight all the time and neither team gets a whole lot out of it i think mike does a great job getting his team to do the right things we had a brisk workout i thought both teams got a lot out of it i know we did
3954540 it is game like out here and you get to see somebody different go against different looks and gauge where you are at i love doing it
3954541 i approached today like it was game day you try to approach every practice like that but when you get a chance to go against this caliber of players it makes you that much faster and that much more motivated
3954542 you want to perform in front of your peers you want to practice well you want to play well and at the same time we want to evaluate a lot of people
3954543 we have a young team with a lot of new guys
3954544 dallas is one of the top three teams in the nfl it gives us a good measuring stick to see where we are at and exactly how far we need to go
3954545 dallas is dallas and they are going to do whatever they are going to do
3954546 we are the broncos and we are not going to try and emulate them we are going to handle ourselves exactly the way our owner does and the way mike shanahan does we are going to be first class and go about our business
3954547 i talked with him before practice and he has dealt with it for a long time
3954548 he said it was manageable just like i have been doing for the last four or five months he went through his career with it and i dont see any reason why i cant
3954549 we brought in a couple of corners that we thought would give us more depth at that position guys that we feel have more of a chance to make our football team
3954550 sometimes you make changes after a game based on how they play we didnt feel like either of those players cb lamont reid and cb christian morton could make our football team so we went in a different direction and brought some guys in that we thought could compete for possibly making our squad
3954551 as to the recent terrorist attacks and whether they have any links with the terrorist forces there is some evidence showing that behind these attacks there might be east turkestan forces
3954552 are not the kind of coordinated terror attacks that are being orchestrated by some kind of organization inside or outside of china
3954553 czecheslovakia similarly peacefully partitioned along ethnic lines in 1992 those were not the existing internal borders
3954554 our plan is to have a demonstration scale plant operational by 2010 and in parallel well be working on the design and construction of a commercial scale facility to open in 2011
3954555 but i do know that invading their countries and making war on them when they have not actually attacked our country first consistently turns into a disaster both for them and for us

3954562 our intent to build a new headquarters in rochester has not changed

3954564 we approved a stock repurchase program because we do not believe that the current stock price is indicative of the companys value and our growth prospects

3954578 social security has been the most effective reliable anti poverty program in americas history but diverting money away from the social security trust fund and gambling it in the stock market takes the guarantee out of guaranteed benefits for current and future retirees
3954579 senator mccain has been quite clear offering more of the same failed bush economic policies and saying personally that he believes that the way social security works is a disgrace
3954580 well the people of minnesota who rely on social security for their retirement years disagree we resoundingly reject the same old politics that put wall street profits ahead of our families we can work together to ensure that social security will continue to be a strong and vital component of american life but privatization is the wrong thing to do and would only serve to destroy the most effective anti poverty program in our history
3954581 after taking a close look at the candidates in this race i was more impressed by senator clintons ability to meet the challenges of the presidency end the war reinvigorate the economy and provide universal healthcare
3954582 most members of congress use the august recess as an opportunity to listen to constituents learn about local issues and concerns and attend community events
3954583 when given the opportunity kline has voted against common sense solutions to our nations energy problems time and time again clearly hes more about the show than the substance
3954584 at a time when the people of the second district really need someone to listen to their concerns and stand up for them john kline is vaulting back to washington going for the gold in the republican olympics of meaningless rhetoric
3954585 minnesotans shouldnt be surprised that kline ignores them after all he has taken over 118 000 from big oil special interests so they know who he really works for but they should be disgusted
3954586 its almost certain that he wouldnt be if not for some of his second district constituents who pushed hard for a public discussion
3954587 senator colemans record breaking trend has gone beyond disturbing to disgusting last month we learned that coleman took more money from big oil and the pharmaceutical industry than any politician in our states history today we learn that he has shattered yet another
3954588 when given the choice between protecting minnesotans from predatory lending and unfair credit practices or siding with big banks and credit card companies norm coleman chose his special interest buddies and they rewarded him with a cool half million dollars
3954589 this new record leaves no doubt that norm coleman would rather cater to the special interests in hitting the trifecta coleman has taken more money from big banks the financial services and credit card industries than any other candidate or member of congress in coleman has taken nearly 530 000 from the commercial banking financial services and credit card industries more than any federal candidate from since 2002 coleman has taken over 411 000 from commercial banks

3954613 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
3954614 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
3954615 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir

3954625 the geese are very wary of them then eventually they figure it out
3954626 theyre very striking when you first come upon them i could see how it would be for someone driving by at 70 miles per hour
3954627 they dont seem to be doing any good anymore and it appears they are upsetting some people
3954628 similar but similar enough that they could probably slip this into a cable re airing of

3954630 in a 3 4 the linebacker has to play on the ball and on the line of scrimmage a lot more
3954631 with our defense 4 3 there is one less linebacker but we are off the ball playing about five yards deep behind the line they seem to like the scheme and understand it we are not doing a whole lot and are trying to keep it simple
3954632 aaron adams made a lot of progress from the spring as far as understanding the scheme and what we want out of him
3954633 joseph thornton should be a candidate for player of the year in the conference he could be an all america in my opinion if he will come to practice and focus on the little things like he needs to he has all the athletic ability in the world he needs to focus on the everyday practice snap to snap jarvis newson has done a really good job for us so far and has some play making ability we have switched smigelsky from sam backer where he was backing up thornton to will linebacker i expect good competition between those two
3954634 i think he is finally catching on to the scheme he has a tendency to play high he is a big guy that can run and has to be more of a big physical presence in the middle for us shane heatherly has done a nice job he had the most tackles at our opening scrimmage and had some nice production arsenio clemons is a typical freshman he has hit the wall as far as learning he didnt fare as well in the scrimmage but he has ability he just has to learn to focus

3954648 wilson and house were willing to bargain territories and populations for the particular peace they wanted
3954649 while the president dreamed of saving the world house was beginning to contemplate the implications for the american state of being a world power in this activity between 1915 and 1917 it is not fanciful to see a first sketchy draft of what would become the national security state
3954650 in spite of all he was doing a break with germany could not be averted but only deferred
3954651 no official role in the campaign yet he planned its structure set its tone guided its finance chose speakers tactics and strategy and not least handled the campaigns greatest asset and greatest potential liability its brilliant but temperamental candidate

3954669 i suspect that the mens 100 and the womens 100 will survive all of the deservedly bad press they have received
3954670 first of all the nature of the event is just too compelling beginning with the tension before the gun goes off knowing that each hundredth of a second could make a difference
3954671 the race is over so quickly that even the spectator is lost in a concentrated almost enhanced reality in which each second has its own developments finally there is the lunge at the finish line and often the anxious wait for the photo of the finish
3954672 fans always want to believe that this time their heroes are clean
3954673 at the sydney olympics i was deeply suspicious of marion jones because of her husband c j hunters drug use but when i expressed my suspicions my colleagues didnt want to hear about it because the herd journalism line was that she was a golden girl
3954674 three years later my publisher wanted to put her picture on the cover of my book i objected and told him i thought she was a drug user when i saw the book for the first time in a bookstore there was marion jones on the cover anyway

3954686 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
3954687 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
3954688 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3954689 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3954690 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3954691 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3954692 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
3954693 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
3954694 sen john mccain said that he is open to choosing a pro choice running mate and named former pennsylvania governor tom ridge as someone who merits
3954695 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
3954696 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
3954697 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
3954698 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
3954699 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
3954700 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
3954701 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3954702 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3954703 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3954704 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3954705 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3954706 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3954707 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can

3954709 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3954710 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3954711 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3954712 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3954713 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
3954714 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
3954715 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
3954716 i debated this fellow many times throughout the state in 2006 and it was like pulling teeth to get him to commit to a position or a plan
3954717 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3954718 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
3954719 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
3954720 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
3954721 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3954722 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
3954723 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
3954724 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
3954725 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
3954726 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
3954727 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
3954728 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
3954729 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3954730 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3954731 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3954732 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3954733 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3954734 just so you all know we did set a record
3954735 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3954736 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3954737 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3954738 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3954739 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3954740 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3954741 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3954742 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3954743 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3954744 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3954745 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3954746 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3954747 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
3954748 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
3954749 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
3954750 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
3954751 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
3954752 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
3954753 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
3954754 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
3954755 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
3954756 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
3954757 these are all small things and they all add up
3954758 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
3954759 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
3954760 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh

3954766 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3954767 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3954768 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3954769 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3954770 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3954771 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3954772 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3954773 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3954774 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3954775 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3954776 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3954777 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3954778 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3954779 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3954780 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3954781 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3954782 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3954783 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3954784 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3954785 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3954786 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3954787 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3954788 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3954789 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3954790 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3954791 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3954792 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3954793 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3954794 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3954795 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3954796 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3954797 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3954798 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3954799 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3954800 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3954801 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3954802 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3954803 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3954804 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3954805 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3954806 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3954807 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3954808 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3954809 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3954810 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3954811 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3954812 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3954813 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3954814 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3954815 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3954816 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3954817 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3954818 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3954819 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3954820 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3954821 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3954822 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3954823 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3954824 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3954825 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
3954826 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3954827 she weighs one hundred fifty kilograms and fires two hundred dollar custom tooled cartridges at ten thousand rounds per minute it costs four hundred thousand dollars to fire this weapon for twelve seconds
3954828 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3954829 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3954830 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3954831 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3954832 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3954833 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3954834 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3954835 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3954836 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3954837 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3954838 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3954839 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3954840 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3954841 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
3954842 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3954843 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3954844 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3954845 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3954846 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3954847 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3954848 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3954849 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3954850 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3954851 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3954852 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3954853 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3954854 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3954855 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3954856 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3954857 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3954858 if you wanna eat my ass i need to rinse off for a second
3954859 damn i forgot how good you are you dont go too fast like most guys and really enjoy the cock youre sucking
3954860 yeah yeah yeah whatever youre doing right there keep doing it
3954861 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3954862 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3954863 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3954864 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3954865 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3954866 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3954867 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3954868 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3954869 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3954870 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
3954871 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
3954872 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
3954873 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
3954874 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
3954875 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
3954876 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
3954877 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3954878 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3954879 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3954880 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3954881 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3954882 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3954883 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3954884 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3954885 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3954886 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3954887 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3954888 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3954889 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3954890 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3954891 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3954892 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3954893 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3954894 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3954895 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3954896 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3954897 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3954898 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3954899 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3954900 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3954901 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3954902 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3954903 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3954904 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3954905 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3954906 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3954907 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3954908 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3954909 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3954910 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3954911 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3954912 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3954913 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3954914 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3954915 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3954916 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3954917 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3954918 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3954919 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3954920 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3954921 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3954922 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3954923 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3954924 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3954925 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3954926 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3954927 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3954928 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3954929 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3954930 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3954931 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3954932 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3954933 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3954934 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3954935 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3954936 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3954937 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3954938 de veiligheid en persoonlijke gezondheid van iedere arbeider in ons bedrijf is fundamenteel en prioritair de preventie tegen ongevallen en ziektes is zodanig belangrijk dat er voorrang aan gegeven zal worden ten nadele van de productie en volgens de noodzakelijkheden
3954939 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3954940 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3954941 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3954942 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3954943 the problems in the world today are so enormous they cannot be solved with the level of thinking that created them
3954944 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3954945 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3954946 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3954947 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3954948 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3954949 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3954950 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3954951 espero que mi oro abra la puerta a muchos m s para el deporte espa ol

3954954 for those who believe no explanation is necessary for those who do not believe no explanation is possible
3954955 for those who believe no explanation is necessary for those who do not believe no explanation is possible
3954956 previously we were sending our drug cases to the state bureau of investigation and because of the back log they have we werent getting them back for four to six months so the nars test allows us to run drug tests in 20 minutes rather than 4 to six months
3954957 if youve got an inmate waiting in jail for four to six months to go to trial and you can produce drug results within 20 minutes and the da can go ahead and move forward then you have that much less stay in jail and of course thats where your cost comes in
3954958 we previously had terms they had to be renegotiated until they were renegotiated the deal wasnt going to go forward
3954959 united group has an excellent reputation for maintaining large campus style facilities
3954960 we can offer the singapore government the best outcomes on project delivery
3954961 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3954962 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3954963 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3954964 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3954965 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3954966 the resource and energy sectors are the locomotives of the market today with bhp rio and woodside all up over four per cent after not a bad night from commodity markets
3954967 the reports that have been coming out by companies over this week have also been really good really impressive and that gives a bit of fortification to the overall markets performance
3954968 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late
3954969 even though the rate cut is priced in theres speculation on whether its 25 or 50 basis points
3954970 the comments by the reserve bank just reinforced the widely held opinion of the rate cut
3954971 the cloud of future rate cuts is plaguing the aussie dollar
3954972 if theres any sort of positive rebound for the aussie it most likely would be an upward movement in gold and oil
3954973 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3954974 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3954975 a shot in the head blow away his brain and the guy is dead he has no more thinking ceases to be a human being just a thing and we use the waste
3954976 because we remove the kidneys fast and at the appropriate time we can guarantee several kidneys in one month the distance where we remove the kidney and transplant is short we can do it in oh less than 10 hours in america it takes more than 20 hours
3954977 organs from executed prisoners are being offered for up to 300 000 each to hong kong liver transplant patients who travel to a mainland hospital
3954978 the organs are of good quality as they come from executed prisoners
3954979 amnesty international reported on this practice in 1993 and called for china to ban this practice however the use of organs from this source continues in china reportedly on a widespread scale
3954980 90 of organs used for transplant in china come from condemned prisoners
3954981 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
3954982 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3954983 they were driving in a land cruiser with a clear irc logo on it
3954984 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3954985 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3954986 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3954987 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan
3954988 humanitarian workers should be protected by the principles of neutrality and impartiality and must not be targeted as they appear to be at present in afghanistan
3954989 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3954990 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3954991 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
3954992 we stood up well because we were so young in the middle of the park
3954993 of course for a game of that level you could be worried but i have confidence in them and i must say i have been paid back very well
3954994 we expected a difficult game and we were not disappointed they man marked us all over the pitch and we needed to be patient and not make any mistakes at the back
3954995 we changed a bit tactically at half time but most important they dropped their level a bit to do what they did in the first half to tackle for every ball is of course very difficult and from then on we looked a bit more comfortable
3954996 its a massive mountain to climb its bigger than everest but we take heart from the performance
3954997 i said before that this game isnt just about now but also the future i like what i see of this team we showed we are a good team who can compete with the likes of arsenal
3954998 we go away thinking 2 0 is an unbelievable result because of the performance we put in
3954999 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half
3955000 everyone has their own opinion of what i should do but i think that its my life
3955001 i know there might be wrong decisions that i make and there might be right decisions that i make but theyre decisions that i make for myself
3955002 and i think the only decision i can make is to be 100 per cent supportive of myself and not doubt myself at all
3955003 i think planning whats going to happen next year or this autumn is going to happen after this week
3955004 right now all im thinking about is how am i going to play good this week how am i maybe going to possibly win this
3955005 im not going to think about the future right now
3955006 i kind of feel sad for the guidance that she seems to not have in the right direction if she wants to be a golfer she should really concentrate on being on the womens tour and dealing with them and learning to win

3955023 we stood up well because we were so young in the middle of the park
3955024 of course for a game of that level you could be worried but i have confidence in them and i must say i have been paid back very well
3955025 we expected a difficult game and we were not disappointed they man marked us all over the pitch and we needed to be patient and not make any mistakes at the back

3955030 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half
3955031 of course you have memories of such a big tournament and losing
3955032 hes a good player so im very happy with this win because i think this was the first true test in this tournament
3955033 if hes too good for me hes too good for me
3955034 every time at the beginning of each match ive felt like i could come out on top
3955035 but i was just making so many errors and i wasnt practicing like that at all it came to a point i think i hit a backhand in the net and i had just had enough
3955036 its only every four years so now is the time to really play well
3955037 its looking great for the americans the past couple of days
3955038 it would be great if we could finish up strong here and walk away with a few medals
3955039 i dont understand why we dont play such a big tournament over 10 days maybe i think this is asking just a little bit too much

3955051 i have used dr joshua weiss to provide negotiation or conflict management skills training to two different clients both times the sessions were excellent and the participants evaluations were almost a perfect 5 out of 5 he is very good about customizing his materials to make them applicable to the clients situation and offers follow up to participants who want to contact him by e mail ive enjoyed meeting him and im looking forward to working with him in the future
3955052 josh thank you so much for the training you provided our team everyone felt that they took away several pearls that they could put to use immediately in managing conflict in our area of business i would highly recommend your course to anyone in business who has to deal with conflict and or negotiation thanks again for your valuable insight
3955053 the workshop that josh conducted was excellent providing everyone in our small group with ideas and techniques that could be applied to both the professional and personal situations a good part of the programs success was a result of the effort josh made beforehand to understand the particular circumstances of our group this enabled him to tailor his examples and exercised to our specific needs we would welcome an opportunity to work with him again
3955054 josh is an expert and excellent trainer in negotiation his teaching style is inclusive and brings you in to the topic as opposed to being afraid of it his real world knowledge of negotiation combined with his study of the best methods allows him to customize his lectures and responses to the needs of those in the class he challenges his students to think outside the box when navigating disputes or conflicts thereby expanding their negotiation toolbox what i really like about his teaching method is that he teaches principles that can be used in almost any situation i highly recommend him to anyone interested in learning about negotiation
3955055 the negotiating tip of the week podcasts have been very useful in my sales position the convenience of downloading the sessions allows me to listen to them during my daily commute knowing why certain techniques are useful is a key to success in negotiating dr weiss approaches the subject through many different avenues giving the listener new perspectives on negotiating the guests he interviews have applicable insights from actual experience which makes the theory relatable thank you dr weiss for the useful information anyone can learn and implement these tips at work and at home
3955056 hi my name is mladen and im a manager in a small european it company i found dr weiss podcasts while browsing business podcasts on itunes since my work requires lot of talking and negotiating with customers and suppliers and my education is primary technical one in nature i subscribed to negotiating tip of the week and i like it very much what i like most are real life examples that dr weiss is using to explain some negotiating principles he is not using just academic talk but real life situations and that makes those tips much easier to apply and give them special value for me beside negotiating tips i found lot of other interesting and very useful info on that helps me in my professional life as well as in my work in local community i would recommend negotiating tip and resources at dr weiss webpage to anybody who is looking for more wisdom in dealing with everyday situations of life and business
3955057 im currently in tel aviv israel where i teach arab and jewish graduate students negotiation mediation and conflict management i am sure that many of you also teach these subjects at various levels so i want to share an assignment i gave my students which has proved very successful dr josh weiss director of the harvards global negotiation project has a website at www negotiationtip com on it he has a weekly negotiation tip he also has listed several dozen podcasts which are mini lectures 3 5 minutes on many topics of interest e g how to negotiate with your boss i have my students listen to a podcast of their choosing and then write me a short paper summarizing what they learned and their reaction to it they seem to enjoy it and learn a lot thank you josh for sharing your insights so broadly
3955058 i am very fond of your podcasts and thank you for releasing them to the masses i get them from i tunes and use them on my daily jogging regime i find your topics very helpful and they help increase my comfort level when i prepare for some sort of negotiation power is knowledge so thanks for the power to navigate thru the dynamics of negotiations more comfortably keep up the good work
3955059 i have been listening to negotiating tip of the week for about six months during this time i was involved in a protracted and difficult negotiation for a long term contract with a customer i used the key principles discussed in the podcasts to progress the negotiations and reach a mutually satisfactory agreement i also find that during more routine negotiations the principles also have application
3955060 being new to the world of business ive learned primarily from reading books then along came podcasts of all the books ive read most were about making decisions and where to go to get answers in business very little was on dealing with people and negotiation so finding your podcast was a piece to the puzzle i was in dire need of finding
3955061 i try to tune in each week to catch your podcasts they are a triumph of brevity and wit remarkable for how much invaluable information and stimulating ideas they contain in a tiny 3 minute long package its always a pleasure to listen in
3955062 especially if you learn best by listening the negotiation tip of the week podcasts are a wonderful gem you should subscribe today from someone at the world famous harvard program on negotiation you learn step by step through information stories and puzzles that negotiation is neither confrontation nor war but a collaborative effort to find a sustainable solution for all parties involved this is the best managerial podcast on the market

3955126 the cloud of future rate cuts is plaguing the aussie dollar

3955154 seeing todays state department its difficult to recall that it was long considered the senior department of the executive branch ref the secretary of states status as 4 in the succession to the presidency appropriately so as state should be the center wheel of our geo political machinery state is everywhere on the front lines the nerve ends of our governments international sensory systems negotiations with state and non state actors are the routine between hopefully infrequent armed conflicts and that is largely states role state is the natural counter weight to dod in a parochial society such as ours the state department staff should be those best able to understand the outside world in any fullness in a multidimensional fashion it has experts with a depth of foreign experience unmatched by other government agencies unlike the academics in the cia or the military professionals in dod deep knowledge of foreign cultures and their leaders is necessary for success in a multi polar world well need people like robert clive and sir richard burton and state is where theyre most likely to find a home in our bureaucracy but not of course in todays state department nor anywhere in the us government apparatus which often rejects people with great initiative and expertise as surely as your body rejects foreign bacilli

3955215 if you were noticing me after i caught the ball i was tucking that thing high and tight baby
3955216 there were three guys converging on me but i didnt see three guys
3955217 i saw two and i thought i could turn and split the two the third guy linebacker lofa tatupu got it because i didnt tuck the ball like i should have its pretty simple
3955218 i just have to make sure i dont fumble again
3955219 if you do it again then the defense really starts trying to rake you and strip you more than they have in the past
3955220 you dont ever want to be known as a fumbler ever
3955221 you really have to work hard to get it off your shoulders to start with you have to come out that very next game and show youre not a fumbler
3955222 you do try to find out are there guys that put the ball on the ground
3955223 if there are you make your players are aware of it and youre going to try and strip the football a little bit more because you want to get in their heads that they may have a fumbling problem
3955224 no turnovers five turnovers most of them are at the hands of inexperienced guys

3955263 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3955264 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3955265 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3955266 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3955267 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3955268 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3955269 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

3955271 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3955272 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3955273 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3955274 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3955275 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3955276 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3955277 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3955278 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3955279 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3955280 who are open to doing something on the production side
3955281 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3955282 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3955283 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3955284 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3955285 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3955286 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3955287 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3955288 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3955289 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3955290 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3955291 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3955292 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3955293 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3955294 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3955295 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3955296 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3955297 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3955298 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3955299 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3955300 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3955301 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3955302 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3955303 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3955304 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3955305 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3955306 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3955307 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3955308 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3955309 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3955310 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3955311 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3955312 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3955313 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

3955316 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3955317 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3955318 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3955319 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3955320 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3955321 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3955322 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3955323 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3955324 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3955325 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3955326 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3955327 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

3955331 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3955332 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3955333 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3955334 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3955335 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3955336 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3955337 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3955338 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3955339 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3955340 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3955341 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3955342 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3955343 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3955344 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3955345 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3955346 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3955347 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3955348 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3955349 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3955350 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3955351 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

3955413 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia

3955415 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
3955416 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
3955417 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
3955418 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
3955419 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
3955420 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
3955421 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
3955422 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
3955423 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
3955424 i think theyre the team to beat coming into the second half theyre so hot right now and theyre playing good baseball the phillies are still on top but a team as hot as the mets is scary
3955425 it weas little consolation to face ron bobby amp sid
3955426 we expect to fortify the team via the trade market
3955427 im not here to make friends i am here to win ballgames
3955428 when the time comes well make a decision on castillo and second base and see how it fits were really playing well at that position i mean very well its going to be a tough one
3955429 youll cry by the end of the 1st episode and 2nd will be worst
3955430 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3955431 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3955432 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3955433 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3955434 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3955435 i want my attorney my tailor my valet and even my wife to believe in god and i fancy that ill be robbed and cuckold less
3955436 until i hear anything else thats the way im looking at it right now
3955437 im focusing on football until i hear anything else ill assume its over
3955438 until i hear anything else thats the way im looking at it right now
3955439 im focusing on football until i hear anything else ill assume its over
3955440 no matter what anybody says theres going to be people who automatically assume guilty until proven innocent which is sort of a tough pill to swallow
3955441 now that its over or seems to be over im trying to move on past it
3955442 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it close to home
3955443 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain
3955444 we knew things were hot and we had been hearing russian jets overhead but the bomb that shook me out of my bed was a signal that there was some danger
3955445 after the ground invasion began they said we needed to get out
3955446 we didnt need the fallback plans we were ecstatic knowing he was on his way back
3955447 i wanted to get out but part of me wanted to stay there with my georgian friends to show them that americans do care
3955448 ive been working there for 15 years and have a lot of friends there all of them were saying wheres america why arent you helping us what could i say
3955449 at this point im just terrified of what the final situation is going to be in georgia
3955450 the bad thing is there will not be a health department as it stands today
3955451 but the good news is some departments will be transferred to other divisions
3955452 im sad to see them disband because theyre a lot of great people who care about the community and give many hours of service
3955453 theyre a great resource and play a big role in supporting the fair
3955454 were not going to have that level of detailed information on our citizenry
3955455 thats going to be something where the regular joe might not feel an impact but it definitely will impact people who want a snapshot of this city in terms of health
3955456 we will ensure that there is a smooth transition for the delivery of those services so that there will be a minimal impact on fort worth residents
3955457 outreach gets them plugged into social services that help them live a better quality of life
3955458 the council could still say were having a public health department
3955459 i will not for any reason recommend this car to anyone or buy another one myself

3955461 peaches is expecting fireworks although she knows her dad will respect her wishes
3955462 wondering what the f her little sister is up to
3955463 peaches was ashamed of the overdose and worried shed end up like amy winehouse
3955464 she and faris had started regularly using drugs and she realised it was becoming a problem
3955465 so when she met max again who is a nice boy and a harvard graduate she thought being alongside him would steer her life on a different path
3955466 he was the nicest boy she could find quickly enough and was the key to her escaping the drugs that have been bringing her down
3955467 only peaches would go so far as to think a wedding would be the best way to go about this though
3955468 when im not in love im unhappy ive only been single once when i was 16 for about six months since i was 13 ive had relationships continuously one after the other
3955469 where do i see myself in five years time hopefully married i want to get married young
3955470 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood source
3955471 frequently text messages the illinois senator with whom hes been friends for many years
3955472 ive spent more time with senator john mccain than i have with senator obama
3955473 although i support senator obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me
3955474 i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid
3955475 her father created the show it just seems wrong if thats the case i dont know what really happened because i havent talked to her i would like to talk to her
3955476 ive played all over the place in the last four years and its not really that different wherever you play the skill sets pretty much the same
3955477 its just the opposition that changes and i happen to be marking the fastest rugby player on the planet so it is going to be a big challenge but im looking forward to that
3955478 obviously they the springboks wings are quick habanas one of the quickest men around so when you are playing someone like him its just being a bit smarter and being ahead of wherever hes going
3955479 pace is a real advantage and he will be looking to use it so i need to use my brains and the pace ive got to shut him down
3955480 no one really takes too much notice of speed times its funny because some guys who are lightning quick between the lights at training when they get on the field they arent quite so quick
3955481 its more about what they call game speed your balance being able to beat a man at pace that sort of stuff so we arent worrying about them having more pace out wide than us
3955482 the sheer number of people that turned out it was just crazy
3955483 the queue for autographs literally stretched out the door of the shopping mall and there were people waiting as far as the eye could see
3955484 im not going to talk about lindsay because shes my friend you know shes great shes also 22 years old i think people forget that with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
3955485 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true
3955486 he was escorted by five security guards off the property it was rough
3955487 surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people
3955488 dont wait until everything is just right it will never be perfect there will always be challenges obstacles and less than perfect conditions so what get started now with each step you take you will grow stronger and stronger more and more skilled more and more self confident and more and more successful
3955489 two guys are traveling to this town in the woods one of them thought he saw someone and decided he was wrong oh look here we are
3955490 we all want this movie to go into production as soon as possible its a fast tracked movie lionsgate felt the process was enhanced by having a second team come in and do a script
3955491 theres no reason there couldnt be a conan movie every two years hes almost like batman hes a dark hero hes a hard hero he has to be badass but we also have to like him
3955492 we stood up well because we were so young in the middle of the park
3955493 of course for a game of that level you could be worried but i have confidence in them and i must say i have been paid back very well
3955494 we expected a difficult game and we were not disappointed they man marked us all over the pitch and we needed to be patient and not make any mistakes at the back
3955495 we changed a bit tactically at half time but most important they dropped their level a bit to do what they did in the first half to tackle for every ball is of course very difficult and from then on we looked a bit more comfortable
3955496 its a massive mountain to climb its bigger than everest but we take heart from the performance
3955497 i said before that this game isnt just about now but also the future i like what i see of this team we showed we are a good team who can compete with the likes of arsenal
3955498 we go away thinking 2 0 is an unbelievable result because of the performance we put in
3955499 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half
3955500 started as a bardic grudge match between chicago and san francisco poets in 1990

3955502 the green mill evolved into a mecca for performance poets and the uptown poetry slam still continues nearly 15 years after its inception
3955503 it is a vulgar error to regard meat in any form as necessary to life all that is necessary to the human body can be supplied by the vegetable kingdom the vegetarian can extract from his food all the principles necessary for the growth and support of the body as well as for the production of heat and force it must 8 be admitted as a fact beyond all question that some persons are stronger and more healthy who live on that food i know how much of the prevailing meat diet is not merely a wasteful extravagance but a source of serious evil to the consumer
3955504 the vegetarians are making a great ado over the triumph of their theory in the long distance test of walking endurance seventy miles in germany this
3955505 we ought to take a house for the winter season the lot of us together and then ask our own friends
3955506 our country simply cannot afford to have insecure supply of electricity
3955507 alternate reality in which theres no such thing as climate change
3955508 national argues we need fossil fuel electricity generation in order to safeguard security of supply which is totally untrue
3955509 latest figures suggest that 1520mw of new generation will be commissioned over the next four years more than twice what is required to meet the increase in demand and most of which will be renewables
3955510 however we will not let the 90 per cent target get in the way of security of supply we will continue to need the constant reliability of thermal generation
3955511 hi tommy say whens the best time to view the coming perseid shower this year ive heard anywhere from 9 pm to not before 3 am and whats the weather forecast for viewing cloudy or worth the trip up to the parkway thanks and enjoy nancy
3955512 the best time to watch regardless of your location is from 2 a m to dawn local time but the best seats will be in the western half of north america where dark skies coincide with the peak activity the perseids get their name from the constellation perseus from which they tend to emanate like spokes from the hub of a wheel the meteors can make their appearance anywhere in the sky however

3955530 from my own experience i can say it has a tendency to divert the mind from solemn serious reflections
3955531 personally i should have considered it a matter for congratulation rather than regret
3955532 i do what has my life been for fifteen years
3955533 what god or the devil has made of it aided by baccarat poor beast
3955534 for fifteen years you have lived the life of a recluse a useless recluse mind you
3955535 but tony do you honestly think the house is large enough for such a queen of a woman wont her throne take up the whole of the first floor
3955536 repair thy wit repair thy wit truly you are devoid of it think you that fairies would change places with sons of clay and human races in one point like to you alone that we are partial to our own for neither would a fairy mother exchange her baby for another but should we change with imps of clay we should be idiots like as they

3955539 we didnt display the mental toughness that we need this morning
3955540 we are at that point during fall camp when it is pretty challenging from a mental standpoint and a standpoint of doing things the way theyre supposed to be done with the intensity we need to do them with we did get a lot of work done on special teams and did some good things from that aspect
3955541 we came back and had a better practice and improved this afternoon but expectations are high and im not sure we met those expectations
3955542 were learning to fight through the challenging times and how to maintain some mental toughness we still had a lot of installation going in during both practices today and those kind of things are coming along very well
3955543 ben is an incredible person and a great young man
3955544 that carries over to the football field with the way he attacks things ben is a very talented athlete with good size and great speed for his position
3955545 its a little known fact that death cant travel faster than the speed of light

3955554 have you done a spacewalk and what is it like

3955562 we fully expect to be a national sport by 2010 and were going to continue to have the world championship in nt this will be the best of the best competing
3955563 our compliance program is an important part of our prevention is better than cure approach to tax administration in which we seek to help people understand and meet their tax and superannuation obligations at the lowest possible cost to them
3955564 by publishing our compliance program we are letting the community know where we will focus our attention and the action we will take so people know which areas of risk they should avoid
3955565 this year we are expanding our coverage of income tax compliance issues across the board with the support of additional government funding
3955566 we are continuing our strong focus on detecting and discouraging the abusive use of tax havens and dodgy tax schemes we are also encouraging people who may have done the wrong thing to come forward before we contact them and take advantage of reduced penalties for coming clean
3955567 this year we will expand our review of executives and directors to include senior executives of private and foreign owned companies focusing on their remuneration packages and any failure to report equity benefits and cash or share bonuses
3955568 we are also examining the compliance risks associated with partnership and trust distributions and i encourage tax agents to discuss this matter with their clients and advise them to come forward if distributions have not been correctly declared
3955569 large business issues on our agenda include promoting good corporate governance and looking at global corporate restructures that shift assets offshore
3955570 we will tackle the unfair cash economy practices that adversely impact many small businesses by working with more industries to develop benchmarks that businesses can use as a guide to getting their tax right
3955571 this will be backed up by greater use of data matching to more effectively identify and target people who may have under reported income or over claimed expenses with more than 5 000 cash economy audits or reviews
3955572 weve had our injuries but everyone goes through injuries we should have the talent to withstand injuries
3955573 the good teams overcome it thats why i will never write off the yankees
3955574 this underscores the emphasis weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player
3955575 its been a team effort all year i expect it to continue
3955576 were not prepared to have things dictated to us everybody in the building ought to understand that
3955577 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
3955578 i am so glad i have w blue sky lives
3955579 during the preseason ill always talk to the other quarterback before or after the game and were all asking hows the arm holding up
3955580 i was getting sacked earlier in the game holding the ball and the falcons tried to rip it out and i held the football in
3955581 that put a hole in the forearm muscle tore it and that put all the stress on the elbow
3955582 thats why on the little throw to brad the ligament went
3955583 you take one of the premier quarterbacks out of the game your team is going to struggle
3955584 we always believed you have to be good up front and your running backs set the tone
3955585 the other defense gets tired and our defense stays fresh it makes it fun
3955586 manny has certainly picked up the personality of this team
3955587 people were eager for a superstar which we had not had here since mike piazza left
3955588 hes got something special hes got a personality hes got a presence
3955589 hes got enthusiasm for the game and hes got some style and cachet to how he does it
3955590 theres no question theres been a different feel in the stadium since hes been here the superstar player is adored in many places here particularly
3955591 i went through all this when i did barry bonds contract in 2002 he signed a five year contract for 90 million when he was 38 and mannys only 36
3955592 in boston you can go in the green monster not here
3955593 mannys always smiling he likes to hug people do those funky handshakes
3955594 thats something the dodgers didnt have that helps because it encourages bonding
3955595 he brings a light in here he gets us loose and ready for the game
3955596 hopefully he stays here for a long time and i can keep learning from him
3955597 weaned on directors like godard antonioni truffaut and fassbinder though the current batch of students shows little interest in these filmmakers or indeed in the work of previous graduates like chen kaige and tian zhuangzhuang
3955598 about the folk singers and artists who fled from the japanese during the war of resistance and ended up in south west china
3955599 rejoice o virgin mary thou alone hast destroyed all heresies in the whole world
3955600 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
3955601 sacrifice to the gods freely or you shall be made to do it against your will
3955602 there is a greater law which says thou shalt adore the lord thy god and him alone shalt thou serve
3955603 choose either to offer sacrifice or to suffer the most rigorous torments
3955604 it is not consistent with reason for a person to adore stones than which nothing is viler or more brittle
3955605 these christians are a hardened race of men to whom it seems desirable rather to die than to live
3955606 it is impious to despise the light for the sake of darkness
3955607 you grow more obstinate by lenity and entreaties i therefore lay them aside and frankly tell you that unless you sacrifice you shall be burnt alive
3955608 as to that i am in no pain the more severe or cruel the torments are the greater the crown will be
3955609 lord jesus preserve me whether we live or die we are thine
3955610 do you know the decree of the senate which commands all to sacrifice to the gods
3955611 the command of god is to take place before that of man
3955612 you run to an unnecessary death your obstinacy astonishes me change your mind
3955613 if the emperor commands me to adore dumb metal in contempt of the true god let me appear before him
3955614 great emperor i have found a seditious man who is disobedient to the laws and even denies to my face that the gods have any power and refuses to sacrifice or to adore your name
3955615 if you see him you will be moved by his speech
3955616 is he such a man that he can even change me
3955617 he will change not only you but the minds of all the people if you once behold his looks you will feel yourself strangely moved to follow his inclinations
3955618 old man why are you come before me speak and he not afraid
3955619 speak freely answer my questions i desire that you he saved
3955620 if i hope to he saved by man i can no longer expect salvation from god if you excel in dignity and power we are nevertheless all mortal alike neither will i be afraid to repeat before you what i have already declared i am a christian nor can i adore wood and stones but i most readily obey the true god whom i know and whose goodness i have experienced
3955621 what harm is it if this man adores the god of whom he speaks as above all others
3955622 be not deceived most invincible emperor he does not call what you imagine god but i know not what jesus whom our nation or ancestors never knew
3955623 go you forth and judge him according to justice and the laws i will not be judge in such an affair
3955624 i will never sacrifice to those which can neither see nor hear
3955625 sacrifice or torments and flames must be your portion he whom you fear is not able to deliver you from them
3955626 neither fire nor the sword will work any change in me
3955627 i thank thy goodness and praise thy power o lord jesus christ that by calling me to the trial of my fidelity thou hast treated me as one of thine
3955628 if you had not been found worthy to suffer you could not be admitted into the court of christ or to the seats of the just
3955629 hey im depressed or horny will you have sex with me to fix my mood
3955630 use your bestfriend to fix the mood when your depressed by having sex so you wont be anymore
3955631 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
3955632 i am so glad i have w blue sky lives
3955633 i wanna hold your dick tight with my 2 hands and just start sucking on it
3955634 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself

3955637 hanging with my bf no time for assholes right now
3955638 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
3955639 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3955640 ive never felt ive been valued by anyone im just a waste of space that everyone ignores like a ghost without a home
3955641 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3955642 people that invest into this property they want it farmed
3955643 therefore they want a return on their investment so that drives my cash rent price that i have to pay up that much more
3955644 they own some ground but not near as much as they farm
3955645 when you think youre gonna make a little more dollars and put them in the bank its really not happening were just writing bigger checks for everything
3955646 anybody can make anything look good on a piece of paper but when it comes down to the nuts and bolts of it its still a tough go
3955647 though were strangers till now were choosing the path between the stars ill leave my love between the stars
3955648 a truth thats told with bad intent beats all the lies you can invent
3955649 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3955650 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
3955651 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3955652 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and avoid paying their fair share in the united states
3955653 effective and agile in managing trends in the financial industry
3955654 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months others have led to the creation of excessively elaborate processes and unnecessary layers of complexity
3955655 the new structure will create a spirit of transformation clear accountability and transparency and will allow us to optimize funding and capital usage this repositioning of the bank will create maximum strategic flexibility to capture the best possible opportunities for shareholder value creation in the future
3955656 a lot has already been achieved in the repositioning of the investment bank we have substantially reduced our risk exposures balance sheet costs and personnel made changes in our group governance model and initiated remediation measures i am determined to make the management of ubs more effective these fundamental changes to the way we run our businesses will now increase the effectiveness of our management structure and processes and of the way our businesses interact
3955657 i havent heard anything about that and i havent had time to think about that issue for some days
3955658 are you asking me as a representative of elbit or of israel aerospace industries
3955659 we have two israeli cabinet ministers one deals with war defense minister david kezerashvili and the other with negotiations state minister for territorial integration temur yakobashvili and that is the israeli involvement here both war and peace are in the hands of israeli jews
3955660 we will fight to the death until the last russian soldier leaves georgian territory
3955661 if georgia falls all of the energy supply routes will be blocked
3955662 trying to take revenge on the united states but instead of attacking the sixth fleet he found himself an easier target
3955663 enabling us to train our army and giving us the possibility to withstand the russians
3955664 israel is betraying us along with the european countries and the united states
3955665 today there was a cossack pogrom against the local population as a jew that gives me a different feeling
3955666 israel did it at the russians behest it aided the terrorists the russians its a disgrace i dont know what it received in return i only see that hezbollah continues to get russian arms and plenty of it
3955667 there are many israeli businesspeople who invested money and a country should protect its citizens investments
3955668 they never believed georgia has such an army and that they would encounter such resistance
3955669 russia deployed 30 000 soldiers and a thousand tanks our people are not suicidal we dont want our soldiers to remain in the field and be killed by russian planes
3955670 the separatists fired at georgian villages we returned fire and asked the russians to order the ossetians to stop the russian representative told me we have to agree to a total cease fire and that president saakashvili had issued such an order to our army and we did not return fire even when they bombarded two of our villages i told the president we should pay the price just let there be peace but when we found out that they were continuing to transfer more weapons through the roki tunnel between russia and ossetia we had to attack it was a matter of screwing or being screwed
3955671 when asked whether the israeli arms played a role in the military successes he claimed the georgian army had achieved he joked
3955672 both war and peace are in the hands of israeli jews
3955673 hold on a sec i think im wrong cos hes making the craziest face
3955674 como hemos conocido toda la vida a plut n como planeta resulta que le hemos cogido tanto cari o que queremos que retorne a ser de nuevo planeta sin embargo como eris es un recien llegado un extra o apenas conocido pues como que a ese nos da igual

3955679 we are gathered together in the sight of god and in the presence of this company to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony which holy estate jesus adorned and beautified by his presence in cana of galilee
3955680 if the ring is dropped or someone makes an error these are the human elements we like to remember laugh about later and tell our grandchildren
3955681 lets go up to richs bridal shop and see what we would buy if money were no object and also to get some idea about the pattern and material we need to buy
3955682 if you are having a wedding make sure jesus is there
3955683 i asked her do you need help she said yes
3955684 we said let the girl go and well leave we told them stop
3955685 she was screaming and all we did was look to help her i got a bottle smashed over my head and after that i started fighting but i got beat down
3955686 when i showed up there were a lot of people there people on the left and people on the right and then boom i got hit and passed out
3955687 we wanted to help out with education as its something everyone takes for granted you go to school in this country until you are 16 at least in other parts of the world thats not the case
3955688 it was nice to feel when i got to the top that i had really earned it and done something to help those girls in africa a lot of these girls come from disadvantaged backgrounds where they dont get given much of a chance
3955689 a lot have run away from home after their parents have been trying to force them into marriage or circumcisions some people there dont see the value of girls being educated
3955690 my concerns are that people in australian workplaces are treated decently
3955691 i certainly have said in relation to telstra that work choices is a thing of australias past not its future
3955692 the workplace ombudsman will certainly respond if a complaint is made the workplace ombudsman has looked at some matters in relation to telstra in the past when complaints have been made i would note that the workplace ombudsman would assist any australian worker who believes they need that assistance generally i would say to telstra and i would say to all australian companies we want to see cooperative industrial relations
3955693 the leaked documents show the company is determined to defy the rudd government on its industrial relations policy
3955694 the documents show telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3955695 were now talking to our staff about collective agreements to make sure that they have the best terms and conditions
3955696 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3955697 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3955698 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3955699 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3955700 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3955701 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3955702 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3955703 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3955704 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3955705 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3955706 ti sembro una bambina delle medie mi spiace ma una cosa molto pi complicata
3955707 il rapporto con la citt totalmente conflittuale dal crack si partiva per occupare case e costruire barricate si disprezzava bologna la bologna bottegaia provvisoriamente picista e codina come bologna ci disprezzava
3955708 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3955709 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3955710 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3955711 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3955712 in fact chinese government officials have already detained several people who applied for protest permits

3955732 the folder has been installed just under two months and we love the results
3955733 the th 82 just seems to speed up the whole folding process
3955734 the major factor is we have been working on a sale of the business for over a year now and we expected to in fact have concluded that sale
3955735 the buyer at the very last moment changed their minds and notified us on friday morning that they were not going to conclude the transaction
3955736 it used to be a town that between ourselves and colorado printing and some other small shops in town we pretty much could service all of this community
3955737 its gotten so much more competitive as growth has occurred in this valley and competitors from different markets have noticed that growth
3955738 the way technology has evolved and the fact that we can send our files so much farther has been a factor
3955739 i think a local company like ours is very much involved in the community but i also understand the customers point of view that they can bid their printing all over the world
3955740 we had the most loyal and dedicated people we gave our employees the option that we understood if some of them wanted to move on they rallied together and said to deanna and i we want to help you guys to bring this to a conclusion i couldnt ask for anything more
3955741 weve had a few layoffs in the last few months weve got about 100 people and we go through periods where its really good and some not as good like any business we adjust to the conditions that we see

3955764 first of all while there are many books written on the printing of newspapers and books there is very little written on the technically and economically important subject of package printing
3955765 in the second place printing processes used for package printing differ from those used for publication and general commercial printing
3955766 accurately capturing the desired color and then reproducing it faithfully and consistently across communications in multiple media is imperative for maintaining the integrity of the design project

3955774 i am not suggesting that we exist in an economic bubble but our customers are long term investors in infrastructure over the past six months we have seen continued investment by these customers irrespective of the economic cycle
3955775 the rmts vote against the companys pay offer and the length of their proposed action defy reason and perhaps suggests there is an ulterior motive behind the rejection they have made no secret of their desire for tube maintenance to return to public ownership
3955776 tube lines has made enormous profits on the backs of our members hard work yet they seem to expect that they will accept an inferior deal on pay pensions and conditions
3955777 metronet workers can join a final salary pension scheme but tube lines wants to keep the door closed on it and tube lines members are also denied the travel facilities that metronet staff enjoy
3955778 we are in the middle of a very serious foreign policy crisis gordon brown is leading the government forward with vigour and determination

3955780 both as a councillor and as a member of parliament john macdougall embodied the best traditions of public service
3955781 this military is telling president pervez musharraf please step down and avoid further humiliation for yourself and also for the army
3955782 the military has probably concluded that president musharraf staying on as the president will only cause more divisions in pakistan
3955783 in public we say the military must remain neutral but in private we all know the military is a powerful player and they have to be on board
3955784 even if by some luck president musharraf survives and carries on the military wants to make clear that it would have no re sponsibility for that outcome
3955785 there is no point pretending that what is happening in the world economy that this unique combination of higher food and energy prices on one hand and a sharp dislocation in the financial sector on the other is going to do anything other than make the next year a painful adjustment for the uk economy

3955919 if you dont want to hear it dont fucking listen
3955920 youre not supposed to be on your phone get the fuck off your phone
3955921 im the only one here theres really nothing i can do
3955922 we were not surprised by the fine performance of the liege side we had seen enough of them to know they were a good aggressive side
3955923 the real surprise for me was the way liverpool played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
3955924 we will have to be a lot better in the second leg at anfield much better
3955925 we have been playing well in pre season looking confident and passing the ball well
3955926 but we did not do any of those things i did not want to bring steven gerrard on because the doctors had told me he was not fit enough to start the match
3955927 we waited until well into the second half before using him but we were not controlling the game and i had to bring him on
3955928 this game was far more difficult than we expected and jose reina was the man of the match
3955929 we know we can always rely on pepe to stop penalties but we have been told that the other effort may have been behind the line but these things happen
3955930 liverpool maybe came here asleep and not expecting this sort of game
3955931 maybe though we have woken them up for the second leg which will me much harder for us
3955932 we felt that if we did not lose this first leg we would still be in with a chance
3955933 we stood up well because we were so young in the middle of the park
3955934 of course for a game of that level you could be worried but i have confidence in them and i must say i have been paid back very well
3955935 we expected a difficult game and we were not disappointed they man marked us all over the pitch and we needed to be patient and not make any mistakes at the back
3955936 we changed a bit tactically at half time but most important they dropped their level a bit to do what they did in the first half to tackle for every ball is of course very difficult and from then on we looked a bit more comfortable
3955937 its a massive mountain to climb its bigger than everest but we take heart from the performance
3955938 i said before that this game isnt just about now but also the future i like what i see of this team we showed we are a good team who can compete with the likes of arsenal
3955939 we go away thinking 2 0 is an unbelievable result because of the performance we put in
3955940 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half
3955941 we are thrilled to have the endorsement of jerome corsi
3955942 for years he has sounded the alarm on key issues from the north american union to immigration these are constitutionalist issues and ours is the only party offering that
3955943 baldwin castle is running on a platform that champions our constitution from where we sit neither obama nor mccain is doing that
3955944 we have no intention of letting them hirvonen and team mate jari matti latvala strike back on an event that has always been favourable to us
3955945 i have tended to enjoy a certain amount of success in the rally of germany but it has never been an easy event to win it has often been a very close run thing
3955946 theres always a lot of fans here also my friends and family go there the course is near to where i come from and that gives you an extra motivation
3955947 but there are no miracles you still have to push hard to fight for victory
3955948 the german course is quite fast for a tarmac rally with very narrow stages
3955949 especially if it rains its a really really nasty one i dont enjoy it then there are so many corners where you can get caught
3955950 in washington d c all calls were dropped after a second or two

3955956 my whole thing is i want to see progress and i want to see it fast
3955957 my goal is to start the season and finish the season
3955958 i refuse to come back early and fall short in the regular season fall short in the postseason
3955959 how about i give you frank gore and willie parker for 2 of your bench
3955960 i will make it the law of the land when im president of the united states
3955961 lu lan was very well prepared and i could not find a chink in her armour during the first game i tried to the left and right but she was always there
3955962 it was like my hand was disobeying me lu lan became more confident with every point she gained and i became so nervous and made many mistakes
3955963 europe is an example of why the church of england did not protect them
3955964 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
3955965 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
3955966 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
3955967 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
3955968 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
3955969 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
3955970 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
3955971 its my first olympics so if its snowing raining i dont care
3955972 the people in the stands that stayed were super loud
3955973 when you look up it pelts you in the eyes
3955974 but its beach volleyball we have to play the elements sometimes its howling wind
3955975 duncan please dont make her choose cause i think shell choose you
3955976 the reasons for re electing giffords can be found in her solid record of accomplishment
3955977 she has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the men and women who have served our country and that is why i proudly stand behind her
3955978 she has been there for us and now we are going to be there for her
3955979 sydney has been a longtime friend of the pro life movement she has worked with us over the years and wants this country to protect the right to life of every person born and unborn we encourage everyone in her district to support her campaign so that she may join other pro life representatives in their efforts to protect all women and children form the scourge of abortion
3955980 its something thats fun and easy and you get to learn more about yourself
3955981 i like to be able to impress my friends with all of the 5 star hotels and resorts i have been to
3955982 i am much more indulgent and carefree while on vacation than i am at home
3955983 your travel type is something of an improv artist exploring nature history and culture all on the path to personal development
3955984 something of a thrill seeking hedonist travel satisfies your insatiable need for the exciting and the exotic
3955985 theres going to be common elements at every site but this is to find out more about themselves and get a personal experience
3955986 they talk about tall ships in this day and age
3955987 we worked tall ships before they were coming up the harbour in all their glitter and glamour
3955988 there was no road system in newfoundland in those days
3955989 with the happenings of 9 11 its taken away the freedom
3955990 people used to come down here in droves it was a like a carnival atmosphere
3955991 things could be arranged but it would have to be arranged by higher ups
3955992 if you live to be older and you dont have family you think a lot about it
3955993 thats when the emptiness of life if you dont put a control on it emotionally can wipe you out
3955994 he was there a little over an hour by himself
3955995 and it all worked out which is the best way to have it

3956086 weve always had an entrance on this side but it has not been extensively used because we didnt have extensive parking over there
3956087 weve combined all the entrances on the west side into one central area so its much less confusing for people and easier for us to do a good job of manning

3956091 at the real zoo sometimes the animals are stuck back in a corner and you cant tell whether its an actual animal or a log
3956092 with us youre right up close to them and you are able to interact with all the animals
3956093 thats why were so popular as long as the fair is open we are there and entertaining
3956094 i started it off as a teen tent with rock music for teens
3956095 it was too small of an audience for what we were doing now its the whole gamut its kind of a cafeteria approach see what they like and show up for what they like
3956096 im definitely a variety artist my range of music goes all over the place
3956097 i love working with a really diverse crowd when you have everything from young kids to the grandparents i really like that at a fair you get everybody and i love that i do audience participation
3956098 for some reason theyve not had a place to use me at the allen county fair before theyve wanted to bring me in before im excited to perform there however
3956099 one of the things that has really grown up is the grandstand entertainment
3956100 my father showed me with true strength courage and integrity the importance of letting go of past pain and regret
3956101 un buen resultado para entrar en la din mica de la champions
3956102 hemos comenzado bien el equipo ha exhibido un futbol propio de lo que ven amos practicando a lo largo de la pretemporada
3956103 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3956104 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3956105 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3956106 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3956107 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
3956108 es un rival complicado tienen mucho tiempo jugando juntos se conocen muy bien y ser sin lugar a dudas muy complicados las cosas se nos han complicado pero esperemos salir ya de esta situaci n
3956109 han tenido errores en todas las zonas si bien no presionamos bien adelante vamos a tener problemas como consecuencia atr s ac si ganamos ganamos todos cuando perdemos perdemos todos sabemos de todo eso y tenemos que empezar bien desde adelante
3956110 porque pesa perder dos partidos de la forma en c mo los perdimos todos los partidos son diferentes y vamos con otra mentalidad de sacarnos esa espinita que tenemos de no ganar
3956111 no quito el dedo del rengl n de un d a regresar
3956112 en este momento el grado de dificultad no tiene nada que ver con la nacionalidad sino de que en m xico hay grupos que manejan determinados nombres y n mero de equipos
3956113 hablamos de promotores de gente que est relacionada con directores deportivo o gerentes deportivos en los equipos y te bloquean
3956114 hay bloqueo porque cuando no dirigen un equipo dirigen otro y est n rotando los t cnicos eso es una realidad lo vemos de manera clara eso b sicamente te cierra las puertas y no te permite poder abrir una puerta en esos niveles entonces est n de una forma blindados y bloqueados los espacios
3956115 nunca he pertenecido a un grupo nunca he tenido un representante las veces que he trabajado es porque me han buscado los directivos de los equipos siempre me he manejado de manera indpendiente
3956116 si no formas parte de un grupo de trabajo ll meses dirigente promotor t cnico te van a bloquedar definitivamente
3956117 para los t cnicos mexicanos se han reducido las posibilidades se han ido aminorando porque est claro que en m xico estamos llenos de gente del extranjero no tengo nada en contra de los for neos pero si hablamos con lo que tiene que ver con los espacios de trabajo hoy los argentinos son la nacionalidad que m s mayor a existe en el futbol mexicano
3956118 ocupan espacios de direcciones deportivas porque ahora no s lo hay t cnicos argentinos sino tambi n hay directores deportivos l gicamente orientan su atenci n a gente de su pa s y eso va cerrando espacios para t cnicos mexicanos
3956119 no comparto mucho esa idea a pesar de incorporar al equipo salvadore o a un jugador nacido en honduras pero debido a que aqu hay pocos jugadores
3956120 en m xico hay suficiente calidad de jugadores para que tenga que recurrir a los que se han naturalizado por circunstancias el tr mite lo hacen para tener un espacio primero en un club y luego en la selecci n y no por estar convencidos por el pa s
3956121 this gives people the opportunity to rent a scooter and just enjoy the heck out of themselves it gives them the freedom to enjoy it all on their own without depending one someone to push them in a wheelchair or anything
3956122 i looked at my husband and he looked at me and said oh no a lois idea it just grew from there
3956123 we travel from coast to coast we have shows in california arizona texas florida you name it we do it
3956124 these are for anyone who needs them some of these people are not handicapped they could be overweight or just have had knee surgery anything like that
3956125 we planned some informal gatherings the youth were still there without any entertainment
3956126 we had some line dancing some card tournaments things like that for the kids who stayed there and we had a really good response
3956127 mill dyed s s surfboards t shirt new in package free old guys rule sticker with shirt purchase
3956128 esto sale con trabajo nada m s debemos aprender de lo malo
3956129 esto sale con trabajo nada m s debemos aprender de lo malo y aplicar las cosas buenas igual si nos sentamos a llorar no vamos a conseguir nada tenemos que esforzarnos cada d a m s porque no estamos bien no andamos en el nivel
3956130 ojal que eso se refleje en el juego y en el resultado en el partido del s bado ante san luis uno siempre trata de que las cosas salgan positivas pero cuenta el rival y que salgas en un buen d a aunque lo que nunca debe faltar es dejar todo dentro de la cancha
3956131 la entrega ojal que partiendo desde la entrega desde la actitud el equipo consiga un buen resultado ac todos perdemos todos ganamos y debemos comportarnos como tal tenemos que redoblar esfuerzos si es que queremos salir de esto
3956132 no como quisiera pero sabemos que nunca es tarde para corregir el camino estamos en la jornada tres y esperemos ya comenzar a sumar de tres no s si ca mos en desconfianza lo que s es que el equipo est consciente que es necesario salir de esto ya
3956133 some men throw their gifts away on a life of mediocrity great men throw everything they have into their gifts and achieve a life of success
3956134 it wasnt really a sudden decision its been a progression
3956135 its very exciting for me to know that at this stage of my fashion career i am able to show in the tents at the same time i am nervous and overwhelmed at the thought being in the tents has always implied a certain status and achievement as well as recognition within the fashion world i am thrilled and feel honored
3956136 reality tv isnt real but something that a hollywood producer has come up with to make money
3956137 theres been a new gold rush a new chapter in alaskan history
3956138 is to show the links between the historical and the present and look to the future as tied to the past
3956139 just did their jobs they didnt think anything they did was special or newsworthy certainly not entertaining
3956140 we wanted to communicate the humanity of the people of alaska
3956141 they do their jobs we work with them we get a story
3956142 to look at the people and their families their work their struggles their lives
3956143 just gotta do it you gotta find it make it fix it by yourself
3956144 is that the production company staff did real research and advance scouting work so when we went into a location there was never a story that was forced
3956145 is the awesome nature of the subject of every character of alaska itself and the challenges that alaska produces
3956146 the basic elements alaska and the workers added up to a good enough story that we didnt need to make up anything
3956147 its 50 below and were driving up the haul road
3956148 im in a big rig pulling 36 inch diameter pipe and the crew is out there filming theyre not hollywood boys theyre workers and every one of them worked as hard as i did
3956149 we were pushed off a boat and had to swim to shore on an island and survive for two days
3956150 nothing was set up no one was paid to do anything we dont compress or extend time or use trickery
3956151 but that would be reality tv and not reality it would also take away the humor which is a crucial part of humanity
3956152 four groups of ordinary people attempt to live in the alaskan wilderness for three months
3956153 but its really stupid and just plain impolite for people to come up here not know what theyre getting into and senselessly put others in a position to lose their own lives
3956154 they drop into an area do a story go home and never understand the people of their circumstances
3956155 i grew up in a house with a lot of books and discussions
3956156 my brother and a hundred or so of my friends from exeter were at yale
3956157 i was working enough on my writing that i just never enrolled
3956158 and i missed the ocean when i was away from it too long
3956159 but time spins around a little different at the top of the planet
3956160 independence of mind fearlessness in reporting excellence of style and above all intellectual liberty
3956161 its telling the stories of people its helping others see the world around them
3956162 thats enough to get you loosened up you know for me the heats good it keeps the body limber
3956163 the qualifying at the olympics probably wont be as hard as trials
3956164 it will be as competitive as in the u s trials
3956165 muna is not going to see anything harder than she already has
3956166 i think that you try to be as normal as possible and you dont try to overdo it with technical adjustments
3956167 we keep talking about the same technical adjustments as all year
3956168 perhaps we represent the new generation of leaders in latin america
3956169 being right wing is out of fashion in latin america join us you are always welcome
3956170 each day the peoples of latin america and the caribbean are electing presidents that look like our peoples and its not just that we look like them we are the people we come from the people
3956171 i am a bit surprised something happened here that i hadnt envisaged
3956172 had to do with attempts to make sure that unasur did not advance these projects always face obstacles from those who do not believe in the union of south america because they continue to think that the future of the continent is being vassals to interests of north american power
3956173 is the biggest economy the most industrialised country with the biggest gdp therefore we have to be conscious of the fact that the integration of south america depends on the actions of brazil
3956174 on one hand we have a photo with presidents considered to be left and on the other with presidents considered to be from the centre
3956175 what is the role of brazil to be a kind of bridge to make a connection between all the political currents of south america because given it is the biggest country brazil has to work towards creating a situation of political economic social and cultural equilibrium
3956176 we are under no obligation to ask permission from the us to do this and they also have to understand our necessity to reach integration
3956177 there can be no assurance that the kftc will approve the possible transaction that an agreement will be reached or that a transaction will occur
3956178 democrats in new jersey are unifying behind barack obama in every way under the leadership of governor corzine
3956179 we are supporting him with financial resources political organization and grass roots activism we are one party behind one candidate this commitment from these top fundraisers is another big step towards victory in november
3956180 the governor was very clear he was the leader of the clinton team and proud of what he had done but proud of where we are now and very clear this is a time to move forward
3956181 we pledged the same commitment to sen obama as we had to sen clinton
3956182 we wanted to get a sense of what he was all about whether he had what it takes to be president unfortunately we never got to meet him
3956183 new jersey continues to wear its true blue stripes and appears to be solidly in sen barack obamas corner heading into the fall campaign like most strong republican contenders sen john mccain can wish but it is unlikely that he can swing the tide in new jersey unless he swings the tide dramatically nationwide
3956184 while no definitive agreement has yet been signed or reached in connection with the discussions a voluntary preliminary filing has been made
3956185 i rode this track a number of times a few years ago and really liked it its kind of similar to some of the gp circuits i have seen and that is cool were definitely tired of second and plan to be number one this time out
3956186 the final race of the season is the 8 hours at daytona explain the teams co owners michael and david lloyd
3956187 we would really like to get a stronger foothold in the standings so that we have a cushion going in doing that means winning the next two rounds and that is what we are hoping to do
3956188 and then we had a problem in the pits that lost us a little more time the crew has been working overtime to make sure that that doesnt happen again with the extra practice time at heartland park things should really be good
3956189 ive raced here a number of times and really like it in fact i won here two years ago one of the neat things about this race is we will be running on friday in the promoter practice having a full day of practice will really give both of us lots of time on the bike and will also give us the opportunity to get everything perfectly dialed
3956190 i figured that this was a good opportunity to get even more time on the track
3956191 the more time i get on the aprilia the better i will get and thats what it is all about
3956192 to validate the statute an individual must have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering
3956193 because specific intent is an element of the offense the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture
3956194 such as death organ failure or serious impairment of body functions
3956195 that statute defined an emergency medical condition that warranted certain health benefits as a condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity including severe pain such that the absence of immediate medical care might reasonably be thought to result in death organ failure or impairment of bodily function
3956196 the health benefits statutes use of severe pain had no relationship whatsoever to the torture statute and even if it did the health benefit statute did not define severe pain rather it used the term severe pain as a sign of an emergency medical condition that if not treated might cause organ failure and the like olcs clumsily definitional arbitrage didnt seem even in the ballpark
3956197 if a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate a criminal prohibition he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the united states by the al qaeda terrorist network
3956198 in that case we believe that he could argue that the executive branchs constitutional authority to protect the nation from attack justified his actions
3956199 among other issues we are examining whether the legal advice contained in those memoranda was consistent with the professional standards that apply to department of justice attorneys
3956200 the cia was seeking to determine the legal limits of interrogation practices for use in cases like that of abu zubaydah the qaeda lieutenant who was captured in march 2002
3956201 bush was fixated on how to get zubaydah to tell us the truth
3956202 one technique the cia officers could use under circumstances without fear of prosecution was strapping a subject down and making him experience a feeling of drowning
3956203 you are dealing in an area where there is potential criminality
3956204 you better be very careful to make sure that whatever you decide to do falls well within what is required by law
3956205 while the documents released today do provide more information about the development and implementation of the bush administrations torture policies even a cursory glance at the documents shows that the administration continues to use national security as a shield to protect government officials from embarrassment criticism and possible criminal prosecution
3956206 these documents supply further evidence if any were needed that the justice department authorized the cia to torture prisoners in its custody
3956207 the justice department twisted the law and in some cases ignored it altogether in order to permit interrogators to use barbaric methods that the u s once prosecuted as war crimes
3956208 there can be no assurance that the kftc will approve the possible transaction that an agreement will be reached or that a transaction will occur
3956209 in our view recognition of the humanitarian disaster and the atrocities that have gone on there is a positive thing
3956210 but his obamas troubles are minimal compared with those of john mccain who looks like the odd man out in the ongoing foreign policy debate having given steadfast support to the policies of both maliki and george bush he has a legitimate complaint they owed him more consideration in the way they announced their shifts as it is mccain appears isolated from trends in both baghdad and washington
3956211 if we escalate the tensions if we succumb to hysteria if we start making threats we are likely to stampede ourselves into a war which most reasonable people agree would be a disaster for us
3956212 and just think what it would do for the united states because it would be the united states which would be at war we will be at war simultaneously in iraq iran afghanistan and pakistan and we would be stuck for the next 20 years
3956213 i believed it was a grave mistake to allow ourselves to be distracted from the fight against al qaeda and the taliban by invading a country iraq that posed no imminent threat and had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
3956214 when the soviets justified their intervention by asserting that they intended to fight against a secret involvement of the united states in afghanistan people didnt believe them however there was a basis of truth you dont regret anything today
3956215 regret what that secret operation to arm the taliban begun six months
3956216 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
3956217 empty condom packet and a photo of the tarts knickers
3956218 the next item that will probably be sold on ebay at a start price of 99c and of course with no reserve
3956219 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
3956220 empty condom packet amp a photo of the tarts knickers
3956221 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
3956222 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage
3956223 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
3956224 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
3956225 there can be no assurance that the kftc will approve the possible transaction that an agreement will be reached or that a transaction will occur
3956226 the korean market due to its relatively more mature nature is probably a good indicator of whats to come in asia as well as other markets and this is most likely very valuable for ebay
3956227 in our view ebay could consolidate its korean business into gmarket and allow local management to run the business
3956228 lor al would like to express its utmost surprise at the result of this decision which dismissed the action from lanc me against ebay for the sale of counterfeit goods
3956229 lor al believed that this judgment by the court digresses from the interpretation of the ecommerce directive provided in recent months by the european commission
3956230 there can be no assurance that the kftc will approve the possible transaction that an agreement will be reached or that a transaction will occur
3956231 they are probably on the outside not as attractive as what weve got at the moment but certainly on the inside they are twice as good as anything being offered at the anu at the moment
3956232 students in accommodation at the anu are pretty damn happy theyre paying less than rest of us and enjoy the on campus experience
3956233 if we can give more students that experience for such a cheap cost that would be fantastic
3956234 the ones in amsterdam which are student accommodation and built like a hall of residence they look fantastic
3956235 theyre bright theyre a little bit weird the using the word funky
3956236 you could tell theyre a shipping container but you can tell theyre a place of residence
3956237 theyre very long and very slim it is the normal size of a shipping container
3956238 they take the ends off both sides one side is an entrance door you walk in and youve got a small kitchen on your right then theres a little corridor with a bathroom and a toilet separate
3956239 then if you go though to the back theres room for a double bed a small couch and a television and theres a balcony off the back
3956240 its a combination of a few things firstly were taking more students at the anu from interstate and overseas as the anus reputation goes up
3956241 weve got more students coming in that arent from canberra which means weve got more of a demand for students who arent living at home
3956242 secondly the canberra rental market is making it pretty tough
3956243 theyre still at the planning stages and nothing is set in stone
3956244 i can tell you right now that those 2 kids that killed him if they wouldve been in trouble rodney wouldve been the first one to pull over to help them no matter what the situation wouldve been
3956245 he wasnt just a community leader and respected wrestler this was just a super naturally nice guy he would help anybody anything the rest of us are hunters he was the kind of guy if he found a wounded snake he would be trying to help the snake while the rest of us would be trying to kill it he hd a really gentle heart
3956246 he was the kind of man every father wants his son to grow up to be

3956248 a major concern is that this particular virus also infects humans
3956249 it doesnt transmit from horses to people but could be transmitted to people by the mosquito bite
3956250 they decide to wait until later in the summer to vaccinate or not vaccinate at all because they dont think its a problem and thats when we start seeing it again
3956251 its very easy usually you just pinch the skin stick it in
3956252 for me spending hundred dollars a year to vaccinate is nothing compared to losing an animal that could be worth not only part of your family 3 to 10 15 000
3956253 a four year college degree seen for generations as a ticket to a better life is no longer enough to guarantee a steadily rising paycheck
3956254 if you needed to make 200 in two weeks how would you do it
3956255 about reusing and repairing objects rather than discarding them to buy more on a deeper level its also a philosophical idea about what ownership really is

3956260 i have people coming to me with masters degrees they cant make ends meet
3956261 the problem with government is that theyre ignorant they need to be educated
3956262 we know the new president will support climate change legislation that the epa will support californias ability to set its own emissions standards that the states will act on climate change if the feds dont and that it will be a bumpy ride for our industry

3956283 but you have to remember the yankees knocked him around in new york and in his other start against them he was hit in the head by a bobby abreu line drive
3956284 winning two of three is pretty good against the yankees and two out of three outstanding starts from our young guys against that lineup thats good too
3956285 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for

3956289 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage
3956290 it was pretty sore the last couple of days but i should be fine
3956291 its pretty sore today but weve got a day off and im going to get some treatment and it should be ready to go
3956292 when i woke up tuesday i couldnt move my head it was pretty bad last night
3956293 right now its not about who were playing its about winning the series
3956294 its obviously nice to beat a team that is so close to us in the wild card race so to be able to go and take two out of three from the yankees and kind of put them in a little more of a hole and separate us from those guys is nice
3956295 but we know how important every game is every series so its going to be this way from here on out

3956300 flew off the handle and jumped out of her chair
3956301 ive known pat for a long time i walked for her when she ran for city council and supported her when she ran for the assembly and senate this is totally totally out of character for her
3956302 i was wondering how much longer they can keep this under cover i didnt want to be the one to blow the whistle
3956303 you state that users who authenticated to the openid provider using an information card would not have their credentials stolen
3956304 i just looked at what the psa ordinance was and what went wrong the last time
3956305 if i have four votes on the council and the mayors backing i will bring this forward
3956306 let me be clear about what i mean here we think of certain things as just the way it is when
3956307 it is difficult for me not to consider the recruitment tactics as brainwashing based on the things my boys told me before they left this last spring
3956308 i am not anti military my father and husband are veterans my brother is active duty and thank god has survived 3 deployments since 9 11 but i am anti occupation and i know even if my 18 year old students dont that they will be sent to the front lines of this heinous hellhole we are continuing to perpetuate will they survive until their 19th birthdays i can barely stand to think of it
3956309 will they survive until their 19th birthdays i can barely stand to think of it
3956310 i weep for our democracy when the boys with means who want to be leaders in the republican party eat up and spout back out the propaganda of an illegal and immoral occupation while the poor boys get seduced by the same propaganda and both groups lose their way
3956311 the only difference is the poor boys are more likely to die before they become men

3956328 to see what is in front of ones nose requires a constant struggle
3956329 its unfortunate and i think pathetic that we saw such a low turnout for a primary that will ultimately have a significant impact on the general election ballot

3956334 a lot of people out here were scared it was going to scar the landscape and look terrible what would really look terrible would be if we had a big fire
3956335 that just really slowed down the spread of that fire
3956336 a large area of homes perhaps several hundred did not burn because the treatments near those homes worked
3956337 if we didnt do this there would be no safe way we could put firefighters in here
3956338 it would be a nasty fire and there are houses all around here

3956371 saul began to destroy the church going from house to house he dragged off men and women and put them in prison
3956372 but barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles he told them how saul on his journey had seen the lord and that the lord had spoken to him and how in damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of jesus
3956373 barnabas went to tarsus to look for saul and when he found him he brought him to antioch so for a whole year barnabas and saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people
3956374 you have to talk to people and educate people to expand the possibilities in this field
3956375 you need to go into larger trials for safety and efficacy insmeds limited data appeared to be good data however bioequivalence testing in healthy volunteers does not provide the necessary data on how the biologic actually works in the body which can only be determined through more extensive clinical testing in patients where safety and efficacy are evaluated
3956376 pada umumnya kita faham dan mengerti tentang sebab sebab pertemuan tersebut diadakan
3956377 namun bagi saya isu ini telah berlalu perkara yang utama sekarang ialah menumpukan perhatian kepada kerjasama dalam pakatan rakyat
3956378 saya beranggapan ucapan dasar oleh ketua dewan pemuda pas pusat salahuddin ayub adalah isyarat yang cukup jelas bahawa pemuda dalam pakatan rakyat akan lebih bekerjasama dalam usaha memperjuangkan hak rakyat

3956393 all of the leading presidential candidates say they favor such measures and some kind of legislation affecting utilities is likely at some point after the november election
3956394 there is a positive link between environmental performance and shareholder value companies in the utility sector which received above average ecovalue 21 ratings when taken as a group outperformed companies with below average ratings by 4 5 percentage points over a three year period
3956395 these and other findings indicate that in every sector rated by innovest companies with above average environmental performance have consistently outperformed lower rated companies as measured by total stock market return
3956396 promote the fast adoption and the sustainable use of renewable energy worldwide taking account of its contribution to security of supply environment and climate protection economic growth and social cohesion regional development and inter generational equity
3956397 active globally minded public with the mindset to support sustained involvement and leadership
3956398 this underscores why america cannot afford another president who sides with big oil instead of consumers
3956399 barack obama has a plan that takes on big oil and would provide us with 1 000 in real relief to get us through todays crisis while putting us squarely on the road to energy independence meanwhile john mccains taken over 2 000 000 in campaign cash from big oil and now wants them to have another 4 000 000 000 in government giveaways we literally cannot afford another president who sides with big oil instead of american consumers
3956400 this would not only permanently bust the budget with its 1 7 trillion price tag but it would tremendously benefit big oil

3956404 if you were noticing me after i caught the ball i was tucking that thing high and tight baby
3956405 there were three guys converging on me but i didnt see three guys
3956406 i saw two and i thought i could turn and split the two the third guy linebacker lofa tatupu got it because i didnt tuck the ball like i should have its pretty simple
3956407 i just have to make sure i dont fumble again
3956408 if you do it again then the defense really starts trying to rake you and strip you more than they have in the past
3956409 you dont ever want to be known as a fumbler ever
3956410 you really have to work hard to get it off your shoulders to start with you have to come out that very next game and show youre not a fumbler
3956411 you do try to find out are there guys that put the ball on the ground
3956412 if there are you make your players are aware of it and youre going to try and strip the football a little bit more because you want to get in their heads that they may have a fumbling problem
3956413 no turnovers five turnovers most of them are at the hands of inexperienced guys
3956414 we dont have any wet ball drills or greased potato drills
3956415 we do talk about raking the ball on defense and carrying it high and tight on offense but were always talking about that
3956416 in my estimation the reason for all the fumbles was its been a little less physical in the camp this year
3956417 having helmets hit your arms is not a natural thing you have to get used to getting banged on those arms

3956420 its a good angela secret and its not about her powers
3956421 theres a softer side to my character in this episode
3956422 as our show does and has done in the past you catch glimpses of time that may or may not actually come to fruition but are possibilities episode nineteen of season one was called five years gone and that whole episode was based on that premise this episode has elements of that and my character is involved in those elements
3956423 there is a little bit of painting that happens in this scene as well
3956424 because i am put in a position to prove something to myself in this scene and i employ my old stand by paint the future power in order to do that
3956425 what was the bennet house is now inexplicably my house
3956426 my son actually is a gifted child hes very subdue and cool both as an actor and a character
3956427 the great thing about my character this year is that hes all over the map in terms of his internal conflicts the orders that he is given by certain people that have power over him this season and the situations that puts him in it really forces him to employ a kind of restraint that you havent seen him necessarily need to employ before
3956428 its the most fun ive had on the show so far thats hard to say actually because the first season was amazing and last year was really exciting too but it feels like its emerging unto itself
3956429 right now im doing episodes two four eight and nine
3956430 i think that the time we had away from the show really made all of us that much more grateful to come back and that much more excited
3956431 its been so long since weve been on the air all of us are just really a hundred percent committed to what were making this year the response that we got at comic con was so exciting and so enthusiastic that were really excited to carry that into the rest of the season with us

3956441 i agree with your premise that sutcliffe was not responsible for all the murders
3956442 i dont think now that sutcliffe did all the killings he confessed to
3956443 this was an identifiable voice there must be people all over the area who would know this man his relatives and his neighbours
3956444 it wasnt a weak man he wasnt a bit of a wimp this was not a pussycat

3956500 police also released details of two phone calls that came into the incident room in both bradford and northumbria within a week of the murder of barbara leach in bradford they claimed that a man phoned in to both stations in a frenzy and claimed that the letters were a hoax the calls were recorded by police manning the phones now chris gregg says that this was john humble who was repentant and attempted to warn police that the letters were a hoax however in the independant newspaper the reporter had taken the trouble to delve further into it and found that the police forensic laboratory had eliminated this voice as being the im jack author shortly after it was made this means that that person could not have been john humble and the police laboratory eliminated him then this information in fact undermines the case against john humble based on police evidence that chris gregg appears to have overlooked in fabricating the confession and conviction of humble
3956501 the hoaxer stitch up of john humble and the corrupt policeman responsible
3956502 i would appeal to anyone who has seen a watch or phone like beckys to come forward
3956503 my team has focused on a large number of suspects over a very short period of time
3956504 i would like to remind people that becky was a 19 year old mother of
3956505 i believe somebody local is out there who murdered this young
3956506 to have been found naked and beaten to death in an alleyway is an

3956508 do you know anyone who wears one of these watches or have you found a watch or been sold a watch like it
3956509 even if someone has innocently bought a south park watch or has been given one as a gift from someone it is important they contact us in confidence
3956510 it may have been found or handed to someone but it could link back to becky and it is important that we trace her missing watch
3956511 deploying femtocells requires a good understanding of market segmentation of both mobile consumer and household markets meticulous planning and targeted marketing campaigns which mean operators will have to invest substantial amount of money if they want femtocell services to gain popularity
3956512 if femtocells are sold to customers in sporadic fashion via traditional mobile operators channels then this may induce a huge scattering of femtocell deployment over large areas not only will this make it hard to manage faps femtocell access points and related networks but most importantly this would mean the operator will not be able to make any capex capital expenditure or opex operational expenditure savings

3956516 weve been very good at recruiting and engaging tech collaborators but our design efforts have been more haphazard
3956517 what goes into creating a great product is a mix of design insight product insight and technical skill
3956518 what weve done is built a way of patterning the essence of a video in a single pattern
3956519 the key to that technique is that unwrapped or flattened image

3956521 early release of terminal or infirm inmates without a doubt saves tremendous amounts of tax dollars
3956522 the taxpayer simply cant afford to pay exploding end of life health care costs
3956523 the release of the inmates is in the sole power of the prisons commissioner theres no telling who we will have heading the prison system 10 or 15 years down the road there needs to be more controls in place
3956524 its particularly important that victims be notified that the offender has been released so victims are aware of the release and can take feasible steps to protect themselves
3956525 those were offenders of lesser crimes if i recall they got involved in drugs once they were released
3956526 mother nature in her infinite wisdom has instilled within each of us a powerful biological instinct to reproduce this is her way of assuring that the human race come what may will never have any disposable income

3956546 im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen
3956547 i still keep wondering about his birthplace and his birth certificate im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen
3956548 according to some people who know what theyre talking about who are experts on this they say that the birth certificate that hes got on his website and has been posted to the daily kos and some other places is it looks very much like a photoshop deal and doesnt look legit
3956549 t he republican party could file a class action suit against obama demanding that he provide positive proof that he is a bona fide american citizen
3956550 t he last time i filled in for quinn and rose a guy sent me info about his belief that the so called barack obama birth certificate is actually photoshopped
3956551 responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
3956552 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
3956553 i work with digital images all the time and this one looks like its been tampered with
3956554 im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen
3956555 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

3956563 if it wasnt for erica i wouldnt know just how evil i am
3956564 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years

3956597 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3956598 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3956599 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3956600 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3956601 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3956602 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3956603 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3956604 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
3956605 i would like to see it go to someone who could give it a retirement that it deserves
3956606 it is not going to last forever obviously and it would be nice to have someone appreciate this level of quality who maybe would display it
3956607 it deserves a retirement with a place of stature and display i dont have the resources to do it
3956608 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3956609 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3956610 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3956611 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3956612 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3956613 it is not an ordinance that impacts or takes into account a persons immigration status
3956614 its not an ordinance that mandates shelters it merely gives communities the ability to have input in the conditional use process
3956615 the proposed ordinance requires only that theres a plan upfront before a store opens
3956616 that is an essential first step to ensure that we have successful day laborer centers in our city
3956617 as this economy gets worse i will tell you there will be more people who want to find day work and i think that this is a good ordinance i think it makes sense
3956618 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
3956619 you see it was the only workers i could get
3956620 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3956621 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3956622 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
3956623 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
3956624 you see it was the only workers i could get
3956625 they injected an anesthetic but didnt wait long enough for it to take effect
3956626 the next week their boss came to me and said your family still doesnt want to pay ransom so we have to send them another one
3956627 i cant describe the anguish i felt imagining pedros suffering
3956628 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
3956629 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
3956630 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3956631 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
3956632 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3956633 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
3956634 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
3956635 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap
3956636 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3956637 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3956638 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3956639 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3956640 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3956641 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3956642 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3956643 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3956644 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3956645 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3956646 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3956647 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3956648 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3956649 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3956650 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3956651 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3956652 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3956653 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3956654 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3956655 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3956656 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3956657 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3956658 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3956659 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3956660 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3956661 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
3956662 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
3956663 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3956664 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3956665 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3956666 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3956667 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3956668 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3956669 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3956670 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3956671 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 y la declaraci n de las naciones unidas esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3956672 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3956673 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3956674 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
3956675 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia
3956676 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n

3956684 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3956685 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3956686 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3956687 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayer
3956688 while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend we will ever miss his love wisdom humor and the familiar comfort of his voice
3956689 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3956690 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3956691 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3956692 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3956693 estoy con la bronca l gica de haber perdido como siempre cuando hay una derrota
3956694 me hubiese gustado jugar en toronto o cincinatti para llegar con un buen ritmo de partidos pero no pude no llegu de la mejor forma pero as y todo hoy tuve chances de ganar
3956695 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3956696 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3956697 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3956698 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3956699 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3956700 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3956701 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3956702 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3956703 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3956704 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3956705 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3956706 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3956707 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3956708 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3956709 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3956710 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3956711 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3956712 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3956713 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3956714 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3956715 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3956716 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3956717 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3956718 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

3956723 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3956724 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3956725 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3956726 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3956727 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3956728 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3956729 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3956730 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3956731 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3956732 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3956733 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3956734 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3956735 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3956736 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3956737 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3956738 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3956739 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3956740 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3956741 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3956742 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3956743 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3956744 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3956745 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3956746 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3956747 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3956748 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3956749 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3956750 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3956751 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3956752 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3956753 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3956754 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3956755 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3956756 best local event of 2007 in the scopes best of st johns readers poll and with a full week of programming prepared this year the event is liable to be just as exciting

3956759 were a rock band a sound project a cabaret act a synchronized rubber glove routine a bbq chicken washing machine
3956760 the government is taking extra precautions because terrorists have lately been using the latest technology to attack urban targets
3956761 we have made strong security arrangements in view of independence day
3956762 we are concerned that there is a great deal of external inspiration and support we are also concerned and are looking at a mastermind within the country
3956763 we have no definite information of an impending attack but were going on the highest state of preparedness
3956764 this is awesome i didnt even know i liked this type of music
3956765 its a big rock and roll show so lets have this guy on a banjo open it
3956766 this is awesome how can you not tap your foot to this i know my fans will like him
3956767 could i suggest a bbq to go with that record a really cheap bbq and some toilet paper maybe
3956768 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
3956769 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3956770 they were driving in a land cruiser with a clear irc logo on it
3956771 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3956772 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3956773 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3956774 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan
3956775 humanitarian workers should be protected by the principles of neutrality and impartiality and must not be targeted as they appear to be at present in afghanistan
3956776 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3956777 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3956778 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
3956779 people need to be waking up to the realities of the world and that the days of easy money have come to a pretty sudden end
3956780 there is an awful lot of talk about big transfers and major demands of players but you will find throughout the uk and europe that money is not quite as easy to obtain as it used to be
3956781 were expecting the levels of transfer fees this summer to still to be quite high but probably not as high as the record that was set last summer
3956782 euro 2008 happened towards the start of the summer transfer window
3956783 the level of transfer activity at the start of a window sometimes decreases when there is a major tournament taking place
3956784 another factor is that the 2008 09 season is the second year of a three year broadcast deal and the level of broadcasting revenues to clubs this year will be broadly similar to what they received last year
3956785 so were not seeing a step change in the amount of revenues that clubs are getting year on year
3956786 another point is weve not seen anything like the number of changes in club ownership in the last 12 months compared to the previous 12 months
3956787 there arent several new owners of premier league clubs for whom this window is their first opportunity to buy and sell players so i think thats another factor
3956788 i see him all the time at least once a week we still have feelings for each other i still love him and i think he loves me
3956789 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3956790 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day
3956791 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3956792 it happened very casually he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and had sex
3956793 like a dagger going through my heart it hurt so bad
3956794 he casey thought she was just saying she was pregnant to get him back because at that point they were broken up once again he told me it wasnt true and not to worry at no point did he say kelli shes pregnant we cant do this anymore its not right we would hang out and hook up have sex i dont know where jamie lynn thought he was he probably said he was just going out with the guys but really he was coming to be with me
3956795 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop but even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3956796 i think that he is trapped when i see jamie lynn doing interviews and talking about how happy she is with casey it seems so fake shes trying to paint a pretty picture but its messy art i want the best for him aldridge i would never trap him into a life with me i would want casey to be with me for the right reasons because he wanted to
3956797 its a wide world capture it with true wide frame
3956798 their workshops are virtually all family owned and they have very modern workshops
3956799 this man had a diesel generator and air compressors and hydraulic pumps attached to it and his saws were all run by hydraulic motors
3956800 some of the pipes on george street are 80 to 100 years old and these will have to be replaced in the next few years
3956801 theyve done sketches and they show that it wont be a lot different
3956802 what theyre proposing is that if were tearing up the street to replace the pipes then the street could be reinstated completely flat from side to side theyve also suggested that there be no raised sidewalks so the sidewalk area can be reserved for outdoor decks that can be removed for snow clearing in the wintertime
3956803 our hope is if it works out to present plans to the public in september and the cost will be split between the city and the gsa
3956804 when you say youre from st johns people from across the country will say george street and nobody wants to change that
3956805 its really like a diary album i felt like releasing it here just meant something to me personally
3956806 here still feels like home and its where ive actually been a part of the music scene
3956807 we eventually took him to the hospital after and he had a torn ligament in his knee throughout the whole tour he keeps re injuring himself
3956808 im really into video art and the early video aesthetic from the 80s and 90s so that led us to having alex bridger dancing in the woods in a white body suit while the other band members threw fluorescent paint at him pretty much
3956809 theyre a pretty warped group so its not like a run of the mill video is going to do the job
3956810 i feel like the spontaneity of the ideas and imagery fit really well with the bands sound i think its really great when a band explores other media
3956811 it was something that didnt exist in the city already
3956812 we didnt have any grant funding for this festival we thought that it would be fine we thought that we could get enough corporate sponsorship together
3956813 purely out of business it had to be cancelled and i hate that so much
3956814 we learned a lot through this process which was really great and really beneficial for next year
3956815 i was ready to jump in over my head with this one
3956816 when i started thinking about it and talking about it to people just their reactions to the idea it was like yeah thats the kind of thing i want thats what i want to evoke
3956817 theres a lot ambiguousness in the movie that you cant change that you shouldnt change
3956818 whenever we had to make a choice in the play to deal with that we just tried to find a way to step over it to allow it to be there and just let the audience choose
3956819 i just want to bring a new younger crowd of people to the theatre people who dont normally go and show them that you can do extraordinary things with it
3956820 it feels like a lightning bolt hit the tip of my penis
3956821 youve got all the old albums if you want to reminisce
3956822 im going to fill a bag with bars of soap and beat the shit out of you with it
3956823 i cant stand to see you so crushed and normal
3956824 about five years ago i noticed that that triangle of grass was not more than a receptacle for tim hortons mugs and cigarette butts so i asked the city if i could take it over they said yes that they had a program for that called adopt a spot they came and looked at me and thought i was a sensible and upright citizen and so it began
3956825 in the parks when the tulips and daffodils are spent the city workers take them up and leave them for people to take ive asked if i could have some of the flowers and theyve been extremely generous
3956826 the most significant family or social problem facing america is the physical absence of the father from the home
3956827 do not let anyone tell you that you are not better than them because you are
3956828 you have deserved this you are hitler the fourth alexander the great the second napoleon the fifth here to destroy the world we know
3956829 do not let anyone tell you that you are not better than them because you are
3956830 you have deserved this you are hitler the fourth alexander the great the second napoleon the fifth here to destroy the world we know
3956831 any decision about it is going to relate to the future of downtown
3956832 with bonus areas we consider impacts on traffic and parking the impact on the street impact on public views to and from the harbor and we try to minimize impacts on heritage areas
3956833 its a balance of whether its a good use for the site and a good use for downtown
3956834 look at cities like new york and all the green space they have theres no reason to not have that here

3956838 what happened is the market i guess at that point might have dropped off significantly maybe it was a question of asking more than the market could bear

3956844 the governor feels that its necessary to make a change like that
3956845 we are deeply upset that a governor that campaigned on putting 1 000 new police on the street will now be removing that number on a daily basis

3956854 in a classic business strategy of divide and conquer telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3956855 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour
3956856 aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
3956857 of course we looked at the companys options if union negotiations broke down and they did
3956858 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3956859 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or work choices and our employees would get to vote on it

3956892 screening for depression during pregnancy is important for this population group given latinas high rates of fertility and births to single women particularly among more acculturated u s born latinas
3956893 the sample for this study was a low income population
3956894 our conclusions may or may not be different for women in other socioeconomic status ses groups hence more research needs to be conducted among latinas from differing ses groups including research focusing on the role of social support and cultural values beliefs related to childbirth and pregnancy among latinas
3956895 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years
3956896 thus it is important to more clearly understand the circumstances that affect their physical and emotional well being during pregnancy so that preventive measures can be initiated this is critical for the overall health of both the mother and child
3956897 women who were us born were significantly more likely than mexican born women to meet the cutoff score 21 on the ces d scale

3956899 for consumers with less discretionary income higher gas prices may be contributing to the degree where little cigars are becoming an appealing substitute
3956900 it may even be seen as more of a premium product than a bargain cigarette
3956901 a substantial share of people who switched may stay there
3956902 we know that there are increased cigarette costs from higher taxes but if that was a motivating force for trade down i think we would see a much bigger figure for little cigars

3956908 when elizabeth was a little crawling baby and michael was in kindergarten
3956909 i want this to be the best thing ive ever done
3956910 and im having so much fun drawing lizzie as a baby again and revisiting all the characters
3956911 things are very slow because mother nature has not cooperated
3956912 everything was coming along good but because we havent seen the sun in the last couple of weeks things just stopped
3956913 the rain has kind of set back the ripening on the green ones and a lot of the big ones are splitting
3956914 we had a good pollination at the first of the season on the blossom and everything looked pretty good then we had a dry spell which may have had some affect on the ripening
3956915 some of them are starting to fall off because they ripened before the rest
3956916 people want them now as soon as they see a few people picking blueberries they assume everybody is
3956917 seventy per cent of my blueberries are in westmorland county
3956918 by the looks of the fruit the bees have done their work
3956919 weve been in kind of cramped quarters for a few years now
3956920 we knew we could easily double the capacity of the store
3956921 were getting down to nitty gritty of the final design stage
3956922 today was done covertly 25 years ago by the cia
3956923 at the outbreak of violence russia had tried to have the united nations security council issue a statement calling on georgia and south ossetia to immediately lay down weapons however washington was disinterested
3956924 the war in georgia is a war for the west
3956925 this is not about georgia any more it is about america its values
3956926 urgent event russian georgian war a challenge for the u s and the world
3956927 seem happy to work together to weaken the influence of the united states and its democratic allies
3956928 significant long term impact on relations between washington and moscow
3956929 president bush why dont you shut up in your statement on monday regarding the legitimate actions of the russian federation in georgia you failed to mention the war crimes perpetrated by georgian military forces which american advisors support against russian and ossetian civilians
3956930 president bush why dont you shut up your american transport aircraft gave a ride home to thousands of georgian soldiers from iraq directly into the combat zone
3956931 so why dont you shut up oh and by the way send some more of your military advisors to georgia they are doing a sterling job and they look all funny down the night sight all green
3956932 this is my first year in this position so we thought we would host an event that was geared toward the demographic that im working with
3956933 its a night to recognize the students who come home from other parts of the province or canada over the summer holidays as well as younger students
3956934 we wanted to get a local band and just through word of mouth we ended up with grindstones name
3956935 grindstone seemed very positive about the event and wanted to support both the youth and my project
3956936 this is to show the youth there are people working on behalf of them
3956937 how would i hugh laurie get in touch with my favorite under employed blogger so i could make out with her and possibly take her to a nice dinner after
3956938 only marginally favorable for development and the potential for tropical cyclone formation during the next day or two has decreased
3956939 these remittances helped to pull many working class barbadians from the depths of destitution during the depression of the 1930s
3956940 barbadians who have made their home abroad are actually ambassadors for this country you stand as vanguards and protectors of our cultural heritage and values in your respective communities workplaces and organisations
3956941 his day is very busy exercising writing reflecting thinking sometimes it is he who gives me international news that i have not had time to read
3956942 fidel is doing almost the same that hes always done
3956943 raul is not going to stop listening to his advice
3956944 the navigator but i do believe he has a kind of veto influence over big issues
3956945 by the same token fidel realizes that he is no longer president and has to allow his successors to chart their own course within certain broad parameters
3956946 has managed to both organize a political succession to his brother raul and to chaperon the new government
3956947 we are concerned that this could have a serious effect on our athletes
3956948 we feel there has been an exceedingly long list of tests and we find this extremely unusual
3956949 it is a major concern to us and they testers have taken a lot of blood
3956950 this is not a protest but we are just saying that it is rather unusual
3956951 if athletes have any concerns they should raise them with the authorities
3956952 the ibaf has been advised of a possible anti doping rule violation by a player from the taiwan team
3956953 as a result the player chang tai shan has been provisionally suspended pending the analysis of the b sample and a formal hearing
3956954 this is the last olympics for the baseball sports and a win here will go down in history
3956955 this is a dream come through for the people of st vincent and the grenadines naturally i feel very humbled because i am at the centre of getting this done
3956956 we will bring to parliament a tobacco control legislation that will reflect the framework convention on tobacco control
3956957 the government of jamaica is serious about tobacco control as demonstrated by the stepwise increase in taxation the last increase was in april this year when a raise was announced to yield projected revenue of 2 88 billion per annum a significant proportion of this will be channeled into the national health fund nhf to be used for health promotion purposes
3956958 this is only because of the deceptive nature of the effects of tobacco use with its long latency period between usage and the manifestation of disease
3956959 as the figures have shown we are facing a situation that is of epidemic proportions and the onus is on us to prevent further devastating effects on society more and more persons are dying from both direct usage of tobacco as well as the second hand effects of its use more and more young people are smoking and there is an increase of smoking among young girls even though we have added taxation to cigarettes
3956960 this is indeed frightening it means that we have not yet been able to reach our young people where it matters most in preventing the start of tobacco use
3956961 were seeking ways to address that issue which is causing tremendous injury and grief to families and this country
3956962 when youre young all you think about is enjoyment you dont really worry about what the future holds being a youth
3956963 but after a while being on the circuit and seeing what can be done this is what i do for a living so i gotta really focus on what i want im focused now i know what i want
3956964 after the world juniors people were saying youre fast kid i was 15 then and they said you can be one of the greatest
3956965 that did not mean a lot to me then but now i know what theyre talking about
3956966 a lot of people my parents my coach my agent everybody trying to say you have a bright future in track and field and explain what you can get out of it and so on
3956967 i started with coach mills in 2005 and from that moment on ive been going up
3956968 i started slow but now im there and im just trying to stay on top now
3956969 i hadnt had much chance to run the 100 metres my coach has been forcing me to run the 400
3956970 i guess its just instinct im working on im just trying to stay away from the 400 metres
3956971 i guess i just blew peoples minds with the 100
3956972 i e fixed costs of the exhibitors screen 4 walling for a week long run on a single screen can easily run 15 20k in major markets
3956973 we are just now at this point in time trying to settle on exactly what is the question we will be asking of the belizean people and exactly what is the question that well be asking of the international court of justice icj
3956974 at a time when the entire world is against the war and even in the united states it has been recognized that the war has been a political disaster the new progressive party expects to hold a special session at the roberto clemente coliseum to tout the war and legitimize the criminal actions of the george w bush administration
3956975 right now what should be done is to demand the return of puerto rican soldiers and stimulate a peaceful environment this event which the npp is touting will confuse our youth and promote militancy
3956976 veterinary students whose goal is to help animals should not be required to cut open donkeys sheep and goats in unnecessary operations help them to recover and then end their lives i urge you implement more humane training methods immediately
3956977 effective immediately my agency will no longer book any travel or vacation packages to st kitts until ross university follows the lead of other more progressive veterinary schools that do not perform any harmful procedures on animals
3956978 sticks and stones can break my bones but words cant do me no harm
3956979 its still the healthiest beverage sector but its prime sun belt market overlaps closely to the areas where the housing bust has been the most severe so there is definitely concern
3956980 after filling up a lot of consumers dont have the heart to even enter the store
3956981 frs has all kinds of funding and a partnership with lance armstrong and the cola giants are blurring the lines whats the difference between amp and a new sku of mountain dew
3956982 hes racing well and the way were activating him is really powerful
3956983 there were plenty of money shots where the guy drinks a monster after winning a medal
3956984 everyone tells me there are 1 000 energy drinks but there are only five that matter

3956991 the primary motivation for a lot of these companies is how do you address downsizing and do it in a way so that the consumer doesnt get a sudden jolt from seeing the really dramatic price change
3956992 were not reducing the amount of coffee weve enhanced the roasting process
3956993 think of it like popcorn theres air in the can its puffier we preroasted it with just the right amount of heat
3956994 its very cohesive and integrated with the overall strategy they have in terms of innovation but also in terms of the way theyre taking out costs and theyre doing so in an environmentally sound way that will connect with the consumer

3956999 theres very little we can say on illicit use we can only comment on appropriate use
3957000 you have baby sitters over and you think about the liquor cabinet but you dont think about the medicine cabinet
3957001 some retail stores have elected to limit the quantities sold
3957002 theres very little we can say on illicit use we can only comment on appropriate use
3957003 you have baby sitters over and you think about the liquor cabinet but you dont think about the medicine cabinet
3957004 some retail stores have elected to limit the quantities sold
3957005 we still see the sirens as an important part of our pathway towards the tall ferns and hope this is not the end of the concept
3957006 while their fate is sealed this season we still intend moving the franchise to another city and establishing a new management structure that can sustain it on a long term basis
3957007 our country simply cannot afford to have insecure supply of electricity
3957008 alternate reality in which theres no such thing as climate change
3957009 national argues we need fossil fuel electricity generation in order to safeguard security of supply which is totally untrue
3957010 latest figures suggest that 1520mw of new generation will be commissioned over the next four years more than twice what is required to meet the increase in demand and most of which will be renewables
3957011 however we will not let the 90 percent target get in the way of security of supply we will continue to need the constant reliability of thermal generation
3957012 its not just about how you dispose of products and packaging anymore

3957024 tu credi che fra gli dei esistano realmente una guerra vicendevole e terribili inimicizie e combattimenti dobbiamo eutifrone effettivamente dire che tutto ci vero

3957026 living in this village i saw every aspect of life from birth to death taking place in the same village not in hospitals or behind walls or closed doors but right out in the open i worked closely with the elderly and was struck by how they were highly valued for their wisdom
3957027 with my experiences with older people growing up and my time in the peace corps i suppose its really no surprise that im now a gerontologist and have such an interest in aging studies and aging issues
3957028 my whole research career has been trying to understand how other people see their lives and how they are affected
3957029 there are so many career opportunities in the whole aging services sector from it to real estate to direct care services and i believe the career options will continue to expand in the future
3957030 its inspiring to see that despite the challenges in the field students are excited about being part of it
3957031 this field needs the best and the brightest and it needs positive people who can see the many opportunities that are available while also inspiring others to see them not only is kevin all those things hes also very enthusiastic about the field and its future and thats exactly what is needed in his role
3957032 they had a special ability of combined with the earths civilization
3957033 i have not seen anything more defamatory than what this man has written none of what he said is true
3957034 major havoc the leader of a brave litter of clones you are them they are you all from one one from all
3957035 hoped it wasnt hillary clinton because he didnt want to design a neon pantsuit
3957036 its her design not mine im just sewing it together
3957037 a medal would be enough to satisfy the chinese people
3957038 our opponents are stronger than us both physically and technically and the result reflects the disparity in the strengths of the two sides
3957039 asian teams usually fall short on the international stage especially when we line up against africans and europeans
3957040 asian players are pacy and flexible but these advantages didnt cancel out the physical strength of our opponents
3957041 we suffered from a lack of experience in the box and we missed too many clear cut chances
3957042 weve shown we are a decent attacking side but our young players need to hone their finishing skills
3957043 weve had problems scoring with this team this is generally a problem with all levels of australias national teams
3957044 there may be some differences of opinion on some issues on major issues such as iran and also the middle east
3957045 but when it comes to anti semitism i think were on the same page
3957046 we mentioned our concerns about anti semitism and asked him what his position was
3957047 and he said he was certainly not an anti semite
3957048 i had an affair i regret it it was wrong
3957049 the present of condition of nepal is due to the lack of coordination between the skill and intention of the leader
3957050 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
3957051 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3957052 ive spoken to mum and dad more so than ahmad he was in the background yelling out get ready and im going to put it over you and get ready to get kicked and just being the older brother bullying me so hopefully i can get one over him again in the derby the f3 derby that would be great
3957053 theyve been going for us since day one theres a lot of loyalty in our family they wont just change teams because the older brothers there ive been here since day one so all their support will be with me
3957054 thats always a footballers number one priority to cement your spot in the starting eleven ive been working really hard on my game with gary van egmond and mark jones theyve helped me out heaps using correct technique both in defence and in attack so hopefully i can show that im a week in week out first grade player
3957055 again theyve written us off weve been tipped to come sixth and seventh we like the underdog tag
3957056 weve been training since may and weve had a lot of games which is great with a lot of great performances and overall its been a good pre season
3957057 to open up the hyundai a league season against newcastle away from home it doesnt get any harder or any better than that were looking forward to a great atmosphere with a great traveling support for the mariners
3957058 we could probably turn up on friday and not say anything to the players just put the eleven on the park and everything else will take over the boys will switch on as there is definitely an edge when it comes to games against the jets
3957059 i definitely knew that he wanted to win that game i was injured that day and he told me i had to be here he made me fly back from holland
3957060 i was trying to get ready for the euros euro 2008 and he said to me that just for the spirit of the team he wanted his captain to be there
3957061 if your manager calls you have got to be back when he calls me im there finished i couldnt really say to him i cant come back because i knew what he wanted
3957062 the only thing i can say is that hes a winner and hes a person who tries to make sure that all the players feel comfortable around him
3957063 i think thats probably two of the biggest parts of him no matter what happens he always wants to win
3957064 when steve bruce came everybody started looking at different things and he shook the team up and put the discipline a bit right
3957065 some of the guys probably had the situation where they maybe had the sun above their head he took the sun away and made sure that everybody worked a bit harder
3957066 hes a good player and he wants to score goals and i think thats the big
3957067 our scores are alarming with regard to those in other towns
3957068 we are 159 out of 169 towns in per pupil spending i hope the scores serve as a wake up call
3957069 there may be some factors in the school environment we can modify or adjust to support student achievement
3957070 teacher effectiveness is at the heart of what we do but not the only factor we have to do some root cause analysis
3957071 in speaking with the state department of education i found the drop off in scores at the middle school level is not uncommon across the state
3957072 we will look for the best practices in the state and across the nation to see whats most helpful in solving the problem
3957073 what we are going to do tomorrow is we are going to go in there and hit it hard
3957074 in terms of the scope and international dimension of this attack its a landmark
3957075 international laws are very poorly developed so it really crosses a line into murky territory is an information blockade an act of war
3957076 seems like the kind of thing that a sophisticated military would want to experiment with
3957077 imagine how devastating it would be to a military commander to lose access to a server that tells him where his troops are stationed and where he has resources
3957078 this is the first time weve had such strong evidence of cyberwarfare
3957079 its an ongoing battle in documenting where its coming from and helping people get around it
3957080 she didnt fit the bill for the image they wanted to project
3957081 i asked sidney poitier to be in the film but he couldnt do it until february which was months after the sundance deadline
3957082 i read the script and the very human story and the very core of this film spoke to me very clearly
3957083 this is a departure from the very big hollywood productions
3957084 it took me about six months to find a location
3957085 i think i got lucky finding the one downtown i think its going to work out very well especially if people start coming back downtown and doing things
3957086 ive never seen anyone not happy about making wine you can do it with your friends and family
3957087 you get to enjoy the product when people find out you make it you become very popular during parties its fun to share that with friends you can use it for gift giving its a nice process
3957088 start with say a chardonnay maybe you wish it was a little sweeter but you like the flavor youll be able to adjust it and add some sweetener if theres too much oak you can take the oak out if you want to mix a fruit flavor with it you can do that youll be able to make it almost customized to your personal taste
3957089 the object of war is not to die for your country but to let the other bastard die for his
3957090 failed to enable constraints one or more rows contains values violating non null unique or foreign key constraints
3957091 this is a fantastic opportunity and i look forward to embracing laras world
3957092 wow jason way to swim you swam faster than you ever did
3957093 you wanna make sure you get the song and youre not just agreeing because you did it together as a couple
3957094 its kind of hard because you two have a special relationship and sometimes when you work with people that youre not as close to your ears are open a lot more it is a little bit harder but its also easier
3957095 he is in what we call a home detention program which means that he has a curfew
3957096 between the hours that the curfew doesnt apply he is free to go and do anything basically
3957097 but he has a full time monitor with him and he has to get permission to go out of town and permission is given for work or community service
3957098 thats our hope unless of course his travel out of town for work or community service takes up more than 5 months
3957099 first he is going to jail for a substantial period of time
3957100 second it is the best way for him to give back to the community and that was very important in negotiations
3957101 very few entertainment artists hip hop rap or otherwise can get through to at risk youth and fans like t i can
3957102 and its important for him to get out the right message that these kids dont wanna live their life like he has they dont wanna go through what he has gone through hes a living example of what can go wrong
3957103 i always win the house is mine she just wants to drag the situation out as long as possible i think she just wants to see me dragging me back and fourth to court my time is worth a lot so im wasting my time right now
3957104 depending on the severity of the case well put them on a suicide watch until we can get them hooked up or get them with the jail psychiatrist
3957105 he was doing what every other teenager would be doing

3957173 the us war on drugs places great emphasis on arresting people for smoking
3957174 taxpayers are forced to pay billions of dollars to persecute prosecute and incarcerate people for having marijuana
3957175 t he u s governments own statistics show that over 75 percent of all americans who use marijuana never use harder drugs
3957176 marijuana does not cause brain damage genetic damage or damage the immune system
3957177 a 1997 ucla school of medicine study volume 155 of the american journal of respiratory amp critical care medicine conducted on 243 marijuana smokers over an 8 year period reported the following findings from the long term study of heavy habitual marijuana smokers argue against the concept that continuing heavy use of marijuana is a significant risk factor for the development of chronic lung disease
3957178 harvard university researchers have reported finding that delta tetrahydrocannabinol thc the main psychoactive component of marijuana reduced the growth of lung cancer in mice
3957179 72 percent of respondents in an aarp survey agree that adults should be allowed to legally use marijuana for medical purposes if a physician recommends it
3957180 tobacco causes 400 000 deaths annually alcohol causes 100 000 all legal drugs cause 20 000 all illegal drugs cause 15 000 caffeine causes 2 000 and aspirin causes 500 deaths annually
3957181 there was what appeared to be pieces of heavily waxed paper and a sort of aluminum like foil some of these pieces had something like numbers and lettering on them but there were no words you were able to make out some of the metal foil pieces had a sort of tape stuck to them and when these were held to the light they showed what looked like pastel flowers or designs even though the stuff looked like tape it could not be peeled off or removed at all
3957182 the writing looked like numbers mostly at least i assumed them to be numbers
3957183 he said it wasnt paper because he couldnt cut it with his knife and the metal was different from anything he had ever seen he said the designs looked like the kind of stuff you would find on firecracker wrappers some sort of figures all done up in pastels but not writing like we would do it
3957184 the piece he brought looked like a kind of tan light brown plastic it was very lightweight like balsa wood it wasnt a large piece maybe about four inches long maybe just larger than a pencil
3957185 we cut on it with a knife and would hold a match on it and it wouldnt burn we knew it wasnt wood it was smooth like plastic it didnt have real sharp corners kind of like a dowel stick kind of dark tan it didnt have any grain just smooth

3957191 randy scheunemann is at a vital nexus and it made tbilisi feel as if it was wedged into the back pocket of dick cheney
3957192 i would say georgia has a very good pr team the u s and the georgian government built a very close relationship and it was too close for the good of either party the u s allowed saakashvili to get too puffed up and think he could fly too close to the sun
3957193 its beyond obama or political strategy or dinging mccain on this or that policy this man is simply too dangerous and unstable to be president people need to wake up and get a look of the preview hes giving us of a mccain presidency

3957198 its kind of a return to rationality where the singular fixation on fuel economy is gone as people think things through clearly and a little more calmly theyll make different decisions
3957199 while some experts have predicted that americans will begin driving much smaller cars as many folks do in europe where fuel is heavily taxed anwyl says americans have built lives around larger vehicles that can carry lots of stuff such as their childrens sports gear
3957200 there are unique needs in the united states the types of vehicles that resonate with consumers will be the ones that offer reasonable utility and pretty good fuel economy not the super small ones with high fuel economy

3957203 this story about jolie taking over is completely false this started with an inaccurate report months ago that said cruise was taking the role

3957205 hes been offered many roles in the past few months were sure to see news about the next project soon
3957206 i got a call from someone very very close to jen over the weekend asking if i knew anyone who might want to go out on a date with her
3957207 they werent being very discreet about it the news hadnt even broken yet that she and john split youd think of all people jen aniston wouldnt need to use people in her camp as a dating service
3957208 she has been focusing so much on her career and business there hasnt been time to spend a lot of money
3957209 hes thinking in the 8 million to 10 million range
3957210 but it depends on how the movie opens and how desperately they want him back
3957211 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
3957212 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
3957213 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
3957214 they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3957215 casey had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop
3957216 even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3957217 i see him all the time at least once a week
3957218 the adoption is now advanced all the government is waiting for is madonna to forward the petition of adoption formalities then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life
3957219 twice i have told the adoption people that i do not want mercy to go outside the country
3957220 i think thats an event i can do well in

3957226 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
3957227 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
3957228 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
3957229 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
3957230 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
3957231 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope
3957232 at that point zachary was so sick we did have him at home but we knew it wasnt much longer
3957233 hes just a crazy little kid who loves to play and swim and throw rocks
3957234 addison did only live three days in this world but because of this she lives on
3957235 food security in the philippines is projected to remain stable
3957236 food and fuel price hikes coupled with the slowdown in economic growth are expected to hinder long term food security progress
3957237 as a result of higher food prices and transportation costs the amount of food aid provided by the united states has declined roughly 50 percent in the last five years
3957238 higher food prices in 2007 and 2008 are not expected to significantly change the countrys food security situation because high levels of money sent by filipino workers in the middle east to support their families back home are expected to support the growing costs imports

3957241 the groups result reflected good contributions from a number of large construction projects in australia and the gulf another solid property development performance and the contract mining of iron ore and coal in australia and indonesia mr king said
3957242 the groups outlook remains strong for the 2009 financial year sustained by a record level of work in hand
3957243 the resources market is expected to remain strong for the group fuelled by international demand for iron ore and coal
3957244 the uncertain economic outlook will provide challenges in the current year and we expect to see pressure on volumes and tonnage in print and distribution amp fulfilment mr evans said
3957245 new zealand is a major part of the pmp business so we have to watch that closely
3957246 from our perspective up to december we know our volumes and our tonnes pretty well so were quite comfortable with that
3957247 were not quite sure what will happen in the second half its a bit unknown
3957248 weve got a number that were looking at very closely he said
3957249 as far as were concerned there are some great opportunities out there
3957250 ill see your arab prince and raise you one reality tv vixen
3957251 we face a tough market in the year ahead but we are well placed to withstand these conditions with a proven business model clear strategy and sound property skills managing director matthew quinn said
3957252 we are budgeting for a nominal increase in earnings per security in financial year 2009 but it is going to be tough and we are assuming that market conditions do not deteriorate further
3957253 looking through the current cycle we expect to achieve higher earnings per security growth from financial year 2010 onwards
3957254 we have seen a steep decline in confidence in the australian reit real estate investment trust sector in recent months and were disappointed to have been impacted he said
3957255 we are intent on restoring confidence through our focus on value creation for our security holders and our sound balance sheet puts us in a good position to do so
3957256 we remain of the view that the medium term prospects for the australian residential market are favourable due to high immigration and significant supply constraints mr quinn said
3957257 where is all the relief aid that we heard is coming because it certainly hasnt come to us
3957258 just in an evening to have all of that taken away from you and then trying to figure out how in the world am i going to survive where do i go how do i eat how do i live thats the tragedy of all of this
3957259 how urgent is it for a child to get something to eat something to drink some place to stay thats the urgency thats there yes we need the funds today well need the funds tomorrow well need the funds all this year every single month
3957260 it may be once in a century we see something like this the rest of the world is catching up to the u s the way i look at it quite a bit for him to be doing what hes doing at this moment in time with the rest of the world coming up the way it is i think that speaks volumes and the way hes attacking this meet too hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying every race its awesome to watch its inspiring to me
3957261 theres nobody in any sport that can win like he wins hes not just winning hes crunching world records and crunching the fields its amazing
3957262 i figured out michael phelps hes not from another planet hes from the future
3957263 poor laszlo cseh the hungarian who twice in these games has finished second to michael phelps was quite frank when asked by a reporter whether he had thought during wednesdays 200m butterfly that he could actually beat michael phelps
3957264 word reaches me out here that some people back home think that michael phelps is
3957265 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
3957266 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
3957267 we always contact them just to let them know what it is that we have
3957268 weve stolen tons more money than the plain bellied sort
3957269 lets make money lots of it im a billionaire investor named warren buffet and ive heard of your troubles ive heard youre unhappy but i can fix that im the fit it up chappie well funnel taxpayer money to men in big houses and ultra rich liberals who want to save grouses or some other kind of bird well strip voters of rights both big and small if you do as i say their be riches for all youll have pure cocaine and whores who keep secrets ill even give you stars like those uppity sneetches
3957270 in the next five to ten years i see more consolidation in every region of the world
3957271 we should expect to see chinese automakers exporting to north america soon as well as european manufacturers bringing their small cars here to manufacture and sell here as well as export back home to take advantage of the weak dollar
3957272 the rest of the regions its going to be more about working with other companies on say platforms or specific deals on buying products
3957273 were not going to be putting any name plate on it until we can be rest assured it meets all of our standards
3957274 that has been the biggest delay in that product program it did not meet our standards
3957275 no one is going to buy a car company like this in the market that its in and expect okay why dont we see if we can go sell it now after one year
3957276 it taught me communications skills it forced me to articulate better have eye contact and how to present yourself in a professional setting it was amazing
3957277 we always had a lot of kids of color because we knew a lot of them didnt have other opportunities to see themselves on tv
3957278 it was a one of a kind opportunity and nothing else can mirror that satisfaction
3957279 joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
3957280 may not get to see much of sen john mccain in person even when hes sitting no more than 40 feet from us on the plane hes still out of sight however his cardboard likeness is always watching over us when were in the sky
3957281 this is the ninth presidential campaign ive covered i cant remember a more scurrilous statement by a major party candidate it smacks of desperation it renews questions about whether mccain has the right temperament for the presidency
3957282 john mccain stood up against george bush and don rumsfeld in the prosecution of the iraq war for many years
3957283 ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
3957284 id like to start out by giving you a little straight talk under the present setup because weve mortgaged our childrens futures you will not have social security benefits that present day retirees have unless we fix it and americans have got to understand that americans have got to understand that we are paying present day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in america today emphasis added and thats a disgrace its an absolute disgrace and its gotta be fixed
3957285 getting out of iraq will require just as much resolution as it took to get in and the same kind of resolution a willingness to ignore the consequences
3957286 this exciting pilot will be a major step forward for medicare we believe that it will provide information and tools that will empower consumers to manage their health
3957287 importantly we intend for the pilot to provide beneficiaries with a choice of products that will make it possible for beneficiaries to meet their individual needs
3957288 at medicare we strive to find innovative ways to better serve our beneficiaries
3957289 this pilot is designed to evaluate how well phrs meet the needs of our beneficiaries and whether phrs can improve health outcomes and lower costs
3957290 i know that she could buy a refrigerator that would be four times more efficient
3957291 has the ability to really help carry that experience to other cities in minnesota
3957292 what weve found historically is that if a whole community has a drive toward energy efficiency you get better results
3957293 it isnt so much about thinking of something new that nobodys ever done before but really getting the widespread adoptions of the tried and true technologies
3957294 both of those that i just described are absolute no brainers
3957295 does commercial building initiative and the collaborative are urgently needed to accelerate innovation and market adoption in the field of high performance buildings
3957296 now we are bringing to bear the unprecedented collaboration in scientific resources of five national laboratories to bring about the needed transformation of the built environment lower our carbon footprint in buildings and accelerate commercial deployment of clean efficient building technologies
3957297 my response simply was did you really just ask me that
3957298 i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
3957299 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet
3957300 it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye
3957301 i just find it really disconcerting that people have to focus on the negative and that some people are sooooo bored with their own lives that they need to manifest lies to hurt another person
3957302 ill see your arab prince and raise you one reality tv vixen
3957303 equivalent to 50 slaves for each man woman and child
3957304 ive heard stories of folks skipping a days worth of medication only taking it every other day or cutting a pill in half
3957305 to save money they dont eat properly they may skip a meal or may not get a well balanced meal trying to save money on food
3957306 seniors have probably been affected by the sluggish economy more than some of the other demographics i would imagine
3957307 thats a lot some of the prescriptions are not generic and not generic are 50 co pay and that adds up quickly
3957308 when you get less money you have to buy less or you have to sacrifice cause you may have to decide whether to buy food or drugs
3957309 said 84 year old clyde mcspadden another galleria woods resident
3957310 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3957311 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3957312 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3957313 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3957314 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3957315 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3957316 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3957317 el presidente ha recibido una carta de los prefectos en la que dicen que est n dispuestos a venir al di logo y el encuentro ser esta misma tarde en el palacio de gobierno
3957318 vamos con una agenda abierta para darle a bolivia tranquilidad en procura de resolver esta contradicci n de visiones que se ha reflejado en el referendo a trav s del escenario del di logo
3957319 la expresi n del pueblo boliviano en el referendo revocatorio es tambi n autonom a pero que no se entienda como la independencia de un departamento autonom a no es separaci n
3957320 vamos a apostar por una verdadera autonom a y ese pedido de autonom a del pueblo boliviano queremos constitucionalizarlo
3957321 the applicant should not be extradited to the united states before midnight on 29 august
3957322 every year flooding causes billions of dollars in property damage in the united states
3957323 yet thousands who experienced flooding had no flood insurance because they thought they would never need it
3957324 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3957325 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3957326 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3957327 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3957328 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3957329 specific requirements are in place to assure there is a lessening or even a removal of potential for damage in future storms
3957330 there are many approaches to mitigating a storm damaged structure
3957331 they include elevation and relocation of properties or simple things such as raising hot water heaters washers and dryers among other things
3957332 we urge all rebuilding contractors and property owners to visit their local permitting offices and obtain the necessary permits before beginning the rebuilding process

3957334 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3957335 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3957336 ive been looking forward to these olympics for so long
3957337 obviously eamon and i are great friends and i support him as much as he supports me
3957338 when my friends at school heard the news of me going to the olympics they thought i was playing a joke on them
3957339 the growing redirection of olympic gold medals is because the old disparities between competitive sports levels due to historical and
3957340 this also means the traditional sporting powers face stronger and stronger challengers
3957341 what is important is to show china and to show beijing to the whole world
3957342 several months ago everyone was talking about tibet but foreigners need to know the truth about china and we believe that through the olympic games the world will know the truth
3957343 news flash ioc president jacques rogge announces that because of chinas enthusiasm and thoughtfulness the next olympics are going to be in beijing too rumour has it state officials fainted and beijing police led the wild cheers
3957344 the chinese name of the theme tune you and me is you oil and mi rice an expression of concern about this years oil and food problems

3957346 we are spending more and more time with our communications devices but spending less on them
3957347 we may not yet have felt the full impact of the economic downturn on consumer and advertiser spend
3957348 while television advertiser revenue has remained relatively steady in nominal terms future stability cannot be taken for granted
3957349 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3957350 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3957351 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3957352 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3957353 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3957354 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3957355 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3957356 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3957357 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3957358 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
3957359 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3957360 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3957361 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3957362 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3957363 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3957364 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3957365 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
3957366 i have to be careful because sometimes hell do a fast movement or run
3957367 but the other members arent as scared as i am
3957368 a blog owner who continuously maliciously and contumeliously went on a rampage to defame me
3957369 i have not seen anything more defamatory than what this man has written none of what he said is true
3957370 this is great to keep overseas singaporeans connected to home news and affairs
3957371 the leaders and races have respected this understanding when tun abdul razak tun hussein onn and myself were prime minister
3957372 what is good for them is not necessarily good for us
3957373 this is great to keep overseas singaporeans connected to home news and affairs
3957374 ive gone over to the us to investigate sasquatches bigfoots and people have dressed up in gorilla costumes a lot of people have tried to fool me
3957375 i think there would be a renewed effort to find a yowie
3957376 yes bob even though simmons placed 32 he just set a canadian record and a personal best he will be very happy at his accomplishment

3957381 more private initiatives come up with corporate support apart from the backing of the government
3957382 that anyone could come into the school after hours and take advantage of defenceless animals that have been lovingly cared for by our students is disappointing
3957383 there will be consequences for the students according to their level of involvement
3957384 the college has put procedures in place to manage the wellbeing of all students
3957385 en este momento el boom que hay en puerto gait n es el petr leo nosotros hemos detectado y hecho denuncias sobre la contaminaci n al r o manacac as y al ca o trampol n insignia de nuestro municipio en donde se ha vertido de manera irresponsable desechos de la producci n petrolera

3957414 with more tickets sold for this years damnation festival in the first month than we managed in the whole of last year it was a simple choice lock out the fans or take the plunge and add the huge 2 000 capacity refectory damnation festival will now host three stages rammed with talent and were delighted to welcome rock sound on board as our newest partners theyve been at the forefront of breaking bands for over a decade and we pride ourselves on doing the same we promised to host the uks finest bill of metal in 2008 and with the addition of legendary uk acts like onslaught and benediction were definitely one step closer tickets are flying out the door at only 29 each so make sure you get a brief whatever it takes
3957415 its gone very well its pretty stress free compared to past records where wed been in there for months and gone over time and budget martin skaroupka is very aggressive our new drummer and hes only 25 so hes really pushed the album on the aggression side of it hes a real asset to the band right now its just basically dani and paul allender writing the music the lyrics everything weve all had ideas but 99 percent of it is kind of pauls baby now and in that way hes probably stressed out but there arent five people around him all stressed out were trying to stick to deadline and budget and for the first time in a long time trying to deliver on time its very stressful rob will surely tell you its about 95 percent done when we get to the studio theres no way were going to pay 600 pounds a day when were still scratching our heads wondering what should come next but to be honest its never finished until its finished things can get changed last minute you can drop a lead guitar part you can add sing over parts its recorded right up until the mastering even though its like skeletons there its still getting flushed out every day were not close minded you have to be sort of flexible
3957416 it depends what theyre saying you either get angry towards it or you find it funny it depends what kind of mood youre in i guess were not a very good band to go around getting offended when weve got the jesus is a cunt shirt there are laws against that now there are certain things you can definitely not get away with if we went to the merchandise company and said this is the t shirt that were going to sell im not sure if they would just refuse it but it was done years ago when we didnt have anyone telling us what to do i wasnt in the band back then but i remember it coming out and causing a bit of a fuss

3957428 there hasnt been any domestic cricket so i havent spent time in the middle
3957429 but thats part and parcel of the game youve got to be prepared for the challenge these are the demands of international cricket
3957430 these things happen youve got to expect that i cant understand how one bad series can make them no good anymore and how people can start speculating about their futures
3957431 sachin has had a long career and when you play for that long you are bound to have a series like this he was scoring all those runs in australia not too long ago he sets high standards for himself and i am sure he will bounce back the unfortunate thing was that india had a few players going through a bad patch at the same time
3957432 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant

3957435 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy

3957448 globalization and technology and automation all weaken the position of workers
3957449 i told the television news reporter that i breed dogs
3957450 he looked at me like he thought i was a harlot
3957451 think about all the sacrafices animals have made for you
3957452 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
3957453 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3957454 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
3957455 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
3957456 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
3957457 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time
3957458 no i cant there is a lot of gold and silver in my boat there is no place here for you
3957459 i cant help you love you are all wet and might damage my boat
3957460 oh love i am so sad that i need to be by myself

3957462 oh well be fine with whatever we just want to see you
3957463 not looking down at them his subjects but right there with them
3957464 when i was a child i spoke and thought and reasoned as a child but when i grew up i put away childish things now we see things imperfectly as in a cloudy mirror but then we will see everything with perfect clarity all that i know now is partial and incomplete but then i will know everything completely just as god now knows me completely
3957465 wait what does a real chef or as the image in my head would have revealed ryan gainey do
3957466 god do you want me to pave the way because you know i dont care what people will think of me if i go down i can pray just as good there as here so if you want i will god if ryan does a slow worship song for the third song ill take that as a sign that you want the altars opened up again
3957467 and god thank you for the awakening that youre bringing to the youth this year and thank you for your glory that youre going to reveal and thank you for the awesome move in trhs that youre going to release through the work of the small group that youre giving me there

3957476 see i told ya i knew how to get back
3957477 european officials are increasingly concerned that sen barack obamas campaign pledge to begin direct talks with iran on its nuclear program without preconditions could potentially rupture u s relations with key european allies early in a potential obama administration
3957478 if we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned i think that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time
3957479 that is what kennedy did with khrushchev thats what nixon did with mao what reagan did with gorbachev
3957480 paul nitze the assistant secretary of defense said the meeting was just a disaster khrushchevs aide after the first day said the american president seemed very inexperienced even immature khrushchev agreed noting that the youthful kennedy was too intelligent and too weak the soviet leader left vienna elated and with a very low opinion of the leader of the free world
3957481 in january 2007 he introduced legislation in the senate to remove all of our combat troops from iraq by march 2008
3957482 obama will immediately begin to remove our troops from iraq he will remove one to two combat brigades each month and have all of our combat brigades out of iraq within 16 months
3957483 would not prove to be one that changes the dynamics significantly
3957484 jerusalem will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
3957485 obviously its jerusalem going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues and jerusalem will be part of the negotiations
3957486 h e used a word to represent what he did not want to see again and then realized afterwards that that word is a code word in the middle east
3957487 i do believe obama is like john kennedy a great man with a great principle and he has a vision to change america to make it in a position to lead the world community but not with humiliation and arrogance
3957488 we all agree that john kennedy was a great president and its flattering when anybody says that barack obama would follow in his footsteps
3957489 i think we should use the hammer of a potential opt out as leverage
3957490 im a big believer in opening up a dialogue and figuring out how we can make this work for all people
3957491 i can no more disown him than i can disown the black community i can no more disown him than i can my white grandmother
3957492 his comments were not only divisive and destructive but i believe that they end up giving comfort to those who prey on hate and i believe that they do not portray accurately the perspective of the black church
3957493 what we know is that in previous terrorist attacks for example the first attack against the world trade center we were able to arrest those responsible put them on trial
3957494 mr obama is hawking a tax policy that would take the nation back to the effective marginal tax rates of the carter days he wants to further tax income payroll capital gains dividends and death his philosophy is pure redistribution
3957495 taxes change behavior by raising rates on upper income payers obama is reducing their incentive to work and take risks the income tax increase is not all that he has in mind for them he plans to increase their payroll taxes the taxes they pay on dividends received and capital gains earned and on any transfers they might have in mind to their kith and kin when they shuffle off this mortal coil if the aggregate of these additional taxes substantially diminishes incentives to set up a small business of the sort that has created most of the new jobs in recent decades the 1 000 tax rebate will be more than offset by the consequences of reduced growth and new business formation
3957496 mr obama favors ethanol subsidies some of which end up in the hands of the same oil companies he says should be subjected to a windfall profits tax
3957497 sen barack obama was the most liberal senator in 2007
3957498 the ratings system devised in 1981 under the direction of william schneider a political analyst and commentator and a contributing editor to national journal also assigns composite scores an average of the members issue based scores in 2007 obamas composite liberal score of 95 5 was the highest in the senate rounding out the top five most liberal senators last year were sens sheldon whitehouse d r i with a composite liberal score of 94 3 joseph biden d del with a 94 2 bernie sanders i vt with a 93 7 and robert menendez d n j with a 92 8
3957499 my boss knew everything that was going on with me
3957500 made it easier for me to just do my job instead of having people wonder if i was pregnant wonder if i was going to leave etc
3957501 id come in late or with a bad result and be in tears
3957502 you blow one of these whistles and wait for the atheists to come running then you can corner them and read them bible verses works like a charm
3957503 the atheist whistle does not offend christians as much as it draws the atheist out of hiding say a whole herd of atheists live in the woods you blow that sucker and they think its jean paul sartre the atheist is a dumb animal you cant tell them nothing

3957507 a faulty fuel flow regulator was replaced overnight and the flight to los angeles is now scheduled to depart at 1 40pm 11 40am aest today
3957508 i see no reason why the court shouldnt act in accordance with the wishes of the parties judge emmett said
3957509 the first defendant and the second defendant were notified of the listing today
3957510 it would appear at this stage there is no appearance
3957511 i apologized to him and i apologized to my teammates
3957512 i told him that hes one of our leaders here and theres no reason for that
3957513 weve got pitchers who can do that to the other team too
3957514 they do that to us why cant we do that to them
3957515 you have to live with that stuff its been around since the beginning of the game
3957516 transformers 2 his co star in the movie and his passenger during the accident
3957517 it was wonderful enough to do it in the 100
3957518 if i could do it in the 200 it would be a dream come true but if i cant it will in no way be a blemish on my career
3957519 it felt great i didnt even know i had broken an olympic record
3957520 it reminded me that i am in the right place and not to stress
3957521 we swam together a little bit and i got to know her she is a great girl
3957522 luckily i was next to the world record holder in the preliminary judging off her i think i did pretty good
3957523 to think that time won it all in sydney but thats what it will take just to get to the final here hopefully im making the finals this time
3957524 all evidence that was collected back in 85 back in 94 and evidence that has been recently collected by way of interviews and everything else will be examined with every modern technology we have available to us
3957525 it was like if you or i were to commit a murder and say oh my goodness what have we done
3957526 like someone had run round the house and picked up lots of different plastic bags
3957527 when our family opened vinyl lite in august of 1978 we rented a small warehouse located at 7325 lockport place
3957528 we had just arrived in virginia from long island ny and all of the locals called us
3957529 above all else the one element that seems to be most important for all customers is trust trust in getting what they are promised trust in being quoted a fair and accurate price and trust in hiring people who are extremely well established in this business and this area with you can be sure your trust is not misplaced
3957530 we pride ourselves in our reputation for a quality product and professional installations
3957531 if a statue in the park of a person on a horse has both front legs in the air the person died in battle if the horse has one front leg in the air the person died as a result of wounds received in battle if the horse has all four legs on the ground the person died of natural causes
3957532 i hope adequate money is being spent on the video because to me the feel of the casting was decidedly low budget first there was the fact that it was in a restaurant the lighting was rather poor the camera they were using to record everyone looked rather consumerish etc maybe none of that matters or maybe all of their production gear is already on the set so they had to make do with this stuff or maybe a completely different team is handling the production that was just interesting to me
3957533 i cant tell you how important it means to the people of this community to get this done
3957534 even with tif funds that count for 48 percent of the development costs the project is still high risk
3957535 identifying and attracting retailers in distressed city neighborhoods is difficult in period of strong retail sales and becomes even extremely difficult during an economic downturn
3957536 the tif approval revalidates our original contention and the viability of the project
3957537 couldnt open this microsoft format at the moment please use the add remove feature to install new applications blablabla
3957538 we just finding out now the school was supposed to bring out brochures to hand out to the parents
3957539 well mom joel did have a little trouble on the bus
3957540 give me more than half of your honestly earned money or you will be arrested
3957541 it seems to me that theres a kind of hear no progress in iraq see no progress in iraq and most of all speak of no progress in iraq
3957542 if you have an important point to make dont try to be subtle or clever use a pile driver hit the point once then come back and hit it again then hit it a third time a tremendous whack
3957543 a wise mans heart directs him towards the right but the foolish mans heart directs him towards the left
3957544 i dont know about you but i have had it with the d c democrats had it with the dlc democrats had it with every calculating equivocating triangulating straddling hair splitting son of a bitch up there and that includes hillary rodham clinton
3957545 the road to hell like the road to its sister city washington d c is paved with good intentions
3957546 republicans have a post 9 11 worldview and many democrats have a pre 9 11 worldview that doesnt make them unpatriotic not at all but it does make them wrong deeply and profoundly and consistently wrong
3957547 when the eagles are silent the parrots begin to jabber
3957548 the first amendment of the constitution was not written to protect the people of this country from religious values it was written to protect religious values from government tyranny
3957549 today we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the right of all who wish to be free
3957550 i dont make jokes i just watch the government and report the facts
3957551 the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants it is its natural manure
3957552 i have sworn before the alter of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
3957553 the only stable state is the one in which men are equal before the law
3957554 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
3957555 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3957556 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3957557 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3957558 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3957559 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan
3957560 humanitarian workers should be protected by the principles of neutrality and impartiality and must not be targeted as they appear to be at present in afghanistan
3957561 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3957562 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3957563 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
3957564 we regret that all of the attempts made by members of parliament and other well intentioned people failed to lessen the stubbornness of the former president
3957565 i think this is an argument the coup leaders are making to justify themselves and what they did but it doesnt conform to reality
3957566 i would have liked to have gone a bit faster trickett said
3957567 what were saying is well do our best to pass as much of any rate cut as we can
3957568 the new reality is that movements in cash rates set by central banks are no longer a reasonable guide to the cost of bank funding
3957569 that means there is no reason for the banks not to pass through any change from the cash rate
3957570 if you are a bank generating significant profits and the commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years i would say that those banks owe it to working families working australians who are under financial pressure at the moment that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3957571 pass on in full reductions in official interest rates as and when they occur
3957572 we will assess it at the time of any rate cut
3957573 as older less expensive funding is maturing and being replaced with new more expensive funding the average cost of funds the money that banks have borrowed on domestic and international markets to lend their customers is increasing
3957574 in my world reality doesnt exist if you try to prove otherwise ill close my eyes until you disappear
3957575 shit bullshit taking it up the ass eating isn t cheating
3957576 were certainly a lot smaller and since the united launch alliance are the only guys in town they dont have to be very responsive to commercial launches
3957577 dont come see it because it gives us a bad reputation that we are dumb we are not dumb were not morons we are people just like you
3957578 por favor cuando escriba no hable s lo de antropofagia

3957585 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
3957586 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
3957587 stable home prices will clarify the level of equity in homes the ultimate collateral support for much of the financial worlds mortgage backed securities
3957588 we wont really know the market value of the asset side of the banking systems balance sheet and hence banks capital until then
3957589 its hard to escape the conclusion that at some point our extraordinary housing boom cannot continue indefinitely into the future
3957590 i could definitely feel on my last 25 metres that my stroke rate was dropping and i wasnt really holding any water so im not really happy with that
3957591 being an olympic year theres lots of fast swimming and this year has been a new experience for me because over the last five or six years i have been on the up and up and this year i have levelled out a little bit which happens to everyone i will come back next year and hopefully in four years i will get going again
3957592 saya tidak melihat ada klub lain yang bisa menjuarai liga inggris selain empat besar di atas namun tottenham punya kualitas yang bisa membuat mereka bertarung untuk posisi empat besar
3957593 saya tidak bisa benar benar memperkirakan siapa tim kejutan liga inggris namun dari tahun ke tahun kita selalu menanti newcastle membaik mereka klub besar punya dukungan besar dan punya pemain pemain bagus jadi tunggu sesuatu yang lebih dari mereka
3957594 c amp ls late nite music club with bruce springsteen
3957595 from tomorrow the ordinary civil police shall be in control of the city the previous reports that you heard that the city was destroyed that there is widespread looting are all false and do not correspond to reality
3957596 the buildings are safe and sound and the water and electricity are on
3957597 some russian troops shall be in the city for two more days in order to carry out a smooth transfer of control to the georgian civil police after which they shall leave
3957598 after today i feel great about our chances at the camp
3957599 if you consider all that you can see our squad is so short i have said many times we are short of one player and i hope i will be capable of doing something this week or before the transfer deadline
3957600 one of the concerns of the taskforce is that we havent been able to see enough of lets say the implementation of the security forces
3957601 we need to speak to the players and governing bodies and see if they are in the same position too if they want to see some more
3957602 maybe there have been misunderstandings and mistakes made but that happens in any big organisation when you make changes it is not an issue
3957603 i am clear we are going in the right direction its a great club and a big club i want to move it forward
3957604 my part of the club has not changed to any great extent we are interested in good players at the right price
3957605 people might have been concerned that maybe funds wont be available for me to bring players to the club i have been reassured that is not the case we are actively pursuing players
3957606 i had a meeting with all the players the other day and the contents will remain private
3957607 but basically we needed to make the group aware that i am in charge and will make decisions that will affect players
3957608 if players leave then that decision will be mine and mine solely thats where we are and i think everyone understands the situation
3957609 vedrans agent has a vested interest in his client but the matter has been resolved
3957610 once we have decided on the matter then we would let aca investigate
3957611 this year is romas year i would put them on a par with inter i dont know if they will win something important but they can achieve one of the two main objectives and they still have time to reinforce the squad
3957612 i have already spoken to claudio ranieri cesare prandelli jose mourinho and luciano spalletti and all the coaches who are involved they know that everyone has to be available
3957613 ik heb gecontroleerd gezwommen al moest ik er wel voor werken maar dit is wel prima

3957616 it is a spectacular four and half years of mayhem when not one terrorist has been caught not one major case solved even by the modest standards that shivraj patils home ministry may have set for itself this is a spectacularly disastrous record
3957617 ask senior police officers investigating even congress chief ministers if they would dare to speak the truth and they will tell you how they pulled away in fright under pressure from the center for targeting and upsetting muslims voters in their investigations this proceeded neatly alongside the utterly communalized discourse on the afzal guru hanging issue
3957618 this government is committed to addressing a growing skills shortage and also to reducing disadvantage and this wonderful program is just the sort of initiative thats needed to help
3957619 by helping those unable to access conventional training opportunities this initiative will reach out and retrain those who have previously been denied the chance to make our state smarter and to enhance their own lives
3957620 it is community organisations like youth projects incorporated that will benefit under our proposed upgrades to victorias training sector where we would make it easier for victorians to re train or boost their existing qualifications
3957621 and by doing so well also reduce disadvantage by allowing more victorians to access these excellent schemes which can also be used to promote healthy living choices and thus help tackle the looming obesity and diabetes epidemics
3957622 without an adequately skilled workforce victoria will not be able to compete in the industries and global economies of the future
3957623 the shortage of skills is creating a barrier to economic growth holding business back and limiting employment opportunities for young people
3957624 the market is feeling the impact from negative events in the uk and the us

3957644 westville is emerging as a great place to live and i plan to continue the current initiatives to maintain the property and commercial tax rates encourage more development in commerce and housing
3957645 the way things are right now i think westville needs someone who can negotiation and listen and i think thats me
3957646 as we share more services with those towns and others it kind of leads us towards at least looking at amalgamation
3957647 this was a young man attacked on his way to work a young man doing something useful like going to work
3957648 one word that describes him is lazy he cant get out of bed until noon smokes drinks uses alcohol on a regular basis uses marijuana he doesnt work he gets 10 a month from his mother so where does the money come from

3957650 youre not helping yourself by having too much free time on your hands this kind of violence means the loss of your freedom

3957653 the call came in that there was a female individual in the bathtub and that she drowned
3957654 the inital report was that it was believed that she had fallen asleep and had drowned in the tub
3957655 although the preliminary cause of death was drowning there was evidence that there was some traumatic injury and some use of violent force against her
3957656 there will also be tie ins with sony when her new album comes
3957657 twenty nine years thats long enough and i was 12 years in the army before that
3957658 one of the things i was proud of is when i came up with the idea of shared services with another town to save money it was first time done in canada and it worked well for us for many years
3957659 the first of july was super hot then we had the fire ban which is not good for campers now with the rain people are leaving because sites are flooded and even though we can have fires its hard to burn the wood because its so wet

3957665 insist s that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3957666 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3957667 the united states and the world expect russia to honor that commitment
3957668 unfortunately were receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3957669 were concerned about reports that georgian citizens of all ethnic origins are not being protected all forces including russian forces have an obligation to protect innocent civilians from attack
3957670 she will personally convey americas unwavering support for georgias democratic government
3957671 as i have made clear russias ongoing actions raise serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3957672 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3957673 russia has warned the united states that it was playing a dangerous game
3957674 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the south ossetian zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi
3957675 we were given an order and we are following it we dont know how long we will be here
3957676 they are killing people there the chechens and the ossetians
3957677 if i had the chance i would go all the way to tbilisi now but there is a peace agreement so they dont let us
3957678 we have instructions not to allow the russians to come any closer to tbilisi
3957679 if we dont wait for them here they will come straight to tbilisi we have no other choice we are ready to fight
3957680 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the south ossetian zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi
3957681 when they are holding the card even when they see the logo that creates a momentary craving

3957695 whos at home doing your mother while youre swanning around here
3957696 people need to be waking up to the realities of the world and that the days of easy money have come to a pretty sudden end
3957697 there is an awful lot of talk about big transfers and major demands of players but you will find throughout the uk and europe that money is not quite as easy to obtain as it used to be
3957698 were expecting the levels of transfer fees this summer to still to be quite high but probably not as high as the record that was set last summer
3957699 euro 2008 happened towards the start of the summer transfer window
3957700 the level of transfer activity at the start of a window sometimes decreases when there is a major tournament taking place
3957701 another factor is that the 2008 09 season is the second year of a three year broadcast deal and the level of broadcasting revenues to clubs this year will be broadly similar to what they received last year
3957702 so were not seeing a step change in the amount of revenues that clubs are getting year on year
3957703 another point is weve not seen anything like the number of changes in club ownership in the last 12 months compared to the previous 12 months
3957704 there arent several new owners of premier league clubs for whom this window is their first opportunity to buy and sell players so i think thats another factor
3957705 dizem que se trata de uma investiga o criminal mas n o poss vel uma celeuma que envolva presidente da rep blica ministro da justi a e ministro do supremo como se a c pula do vaticano se reunisse com o papa para decidir se pregui a pecado capital

3957709 f there are indeed haitian athletes in beijing who decide to defect i could not blame them
3957710 do you think a new haiti is possible and are you prepared to do what it takes to get it to a point where it produces 300 000 potential olympians a year rather than 300 000 child slaves
3957711 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
3957712 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson

3957742 techies often forget about the softer side of the it business and mentors know that one day these skills will come in handy
3957743 techies tend to live in a world of their own but as their careers progress they would have to go out and meet customers and find themselves short on soft skills
3957744 it hit me when i had to articulate technology solutions in laymans terms and i couldnt and someone had to become my translator

3957746 the goal is to put silverlight on every device and client on the market

3957749 less than 10 of systems centre users and customers know the products in great detail so i thought it would be a great idea to get them all together to share the tips and tricks
3957750 most of the time these personnel lack training in the area but some companies hand them the responsibility anyway because the company sees a hint of it systems talent in them
3957751 there are even instances when the products were wrongly used or the wrong products were bought by companies
3957752 the media focuses on digital consumer electronics so more technical products like systems centre would not be familiar to all and sundry
3957753 we also hope to discuss issues facing systems centre users and possibly come up with our own set of best practices to tackle these problems

3957805 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
3957806 to somehow suggest obama is supportive of gun owners because he says so when he is in montana running for president is absurd
3957807 we are going to make sure that anybody that tells montana gun owners that barack obama is not a threat to gun owners is exposed as someone who is not shooting straight
3957808 if we do not i can almost promise you nrg is going to be tired of the city and say were trying to give you some canals

3957818 observers say moscows real interest is not to annex abkhazia and south ossetia but rather to keep the conflicts simmering in order to derail georgias nato bid
3957819 if georgia was a nato member now we would be at war with russia
3957820 my friends the 1st brigade of the 25th infantry division will travel north on foot from mosul through turkey and armenia while the 3rd brigade will move out from kirkuk and fight its way through iran to georgia i believe that the success in georgia will be fairly easy

3957827 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3957828 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3957829 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3957830 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3957831 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3957832 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3957833 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3957834 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3957835 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3957836 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3957840 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3957841 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3957842 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3957843 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3957847 we need action and it needs to be based on information
3957848 there is good information that the water is available and can be transferred down the river
3957849 we need the authority of the senate to say to the government you are wrong the water is available heres where it is and heres what it will cost
3957850 im sure nick will be behind it im sure family first steve fielding will be behind it im sure the coalition will be behind it
3957851 i cant believe that anybody in the senate including government senators would not want to support urgent action

3957860 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
3957861 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3957862 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3957863 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3957864 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3957865 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan
3957866 humanitarian workers should be protected by the principles of neutrality and impartiality and must not be targeted as they appear to be at present in afghanistan
3957867 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3957868 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3957869 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups

3957878 orchestral instruments dont come more treacherous than the french horn either for the musicians who play it or when the going gets rough for the listeners who find themselves within earshot
3957879 its principal player philip myers is wildly inconsistent and the rest of the section is also accident prone he cracks misses or slides into pitches often enough that when the philharmonic plays a work with a prominent horn line you brace yourself and wonder if hell make it
3957880 if there exists a more noble sound than eight horns singing a melody fortissimo in unison i have never heard it

3957919 the government of india finds deeply objectionable the series of remarks by the official spokesman and leaders in pakistan on recent events in the indian state of jammu and kashmir
3957920 we are witnessing a recurrence of pakistani rhetoric and allegations that are factually wrong and that bear no relationship to reality
3957921 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mindset that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
3957922 it is not too late for pakistani leaders and spokesmen to desist from the course of action that they have recently embarked upon and we would urge them to do so forthwith
3957923 we are deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation in the indian occupied kashmir which is resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people and violation of their human rights
3957924 gross violation of human rights of kashmiri people unwarranted violence against them and their economic blockade perpetrated by extremist elements

3957953 who are these agitators this is nothing but a shortcut to fame the boys of the sikh youth federation mustve thought that when delhis gurdwara committee protested akshay rushed to delhi in amritsar they mustve thought this is their way of getting akshay into amritsar
3957954 all the important and powerful bodies of the sikh community cleared the film what were these boys on friday protesting about they said they hadnt even seen the film they just said it was an insult to sikhism but in what way
3957955 they feel somehow their culture will be threatened when films like jodhaa akbar and singh is kinng pay homage to the people and culture of a community
3957956 they were doing bhangra with dhols after the screening they told a news channel that this was the first film in 70 years of indian cinema that had done justice to the sikh community what more endorsement for our motives can there be

3957994 el gobierno rechaza cualquier procedimiento de desalojo que se haga a oscuras antes de que brille el sol encontrando a las familias por sorpresa y dormidas que le lleguen a una familia con los ni os dormidos y con escuadrones enteros
3957995 los procesos judiciales deben adelantarse sin que se quebranten los derechos de las personas bajo ninguna circunstancia
3957996 not too bad my arms kinda draggin a little its not really sore just fatigued
3957997 no pain but im 38 years old i have to be fatigued a little
3957998 ive been trying for some time to develop a lifestyle that doesnt require my presence
3957999 the rise and burnout of swedens first political party built entirely around womens issues
3958000 to declare that all men are guilty of all rapes that all men are guilty of violence against women thats not just offensive and wrong if the purpose is to get anywhere with this issue its just plain stupid
3958001 at its recent founding congress for example instead of tackling a mainstream platform as planned the party presented proposals to abolish marriage and create
3958002 gender feminism is an ideology that grew as socialist sought new ways to promote their ideas following the fall of communism
3958003 the organiser of the annual miss sweden beauty pageant has been forced to cancel this years contest following
3958004 i could understand this kind of reaction in an arabic country
3958005 but not in sweden particularly considering what you see on tv here every day
3958006 in sweden the cross walk signs have a character known throughout sweden as herr g rman or mr walkman the figure looks pretty gender neutral really but the fru g rman will most likely have a skirt because all women wear skirts which brings up all sorts of strange sexist questions in and of itself but no matter im just appalled that this is seen as progress is this really what equality is about making sure that a road sign is changed really work on something that matters because the gender of a black silhouette on a crosswalk sign cant be what those women who fought for the right to vote were really worried about then again im not a feminist or a woman so what do i know but either way id like to say welcome to sweden where feminists have managed to emasculate even a road sign
3958007 a lone fathers rights advocate pointed out that violence by women against men is just as common as the reverse and that the high statistics feminists quote regarding violence against women include mostly false allegations made during divorce proceedings
3958008 a research project in mathematics you say how will this help to bring down the male dominated system of society
3958009 the proud lion of swedens nordic battlegroups coat of arms has been emasculated because a group of female soldiers lodged a complaint with the european court of justice
3958010 we were forced to cut the lions willy off with the aid of a computer
3958011 the army lacks knowledge about heraldry once upon a time coats of arms containing lions without genitalia were given to those who betrayed the crown
3958012 2nd lt girdano spc mulvihill pfc badie and pvt garcias actions are an inspiration to us all and their names will forever be etched in the history of the big red one
3958013 there comes a time in our lives when we transition from childhood to adulthood and once we make that transition we are faced with two paths one path is a path in which freedom and security are provided by the blood sweat and tears of others the second is a world in which we make a stand and say follow me for i will protect you from those who mean you harm it takes a special person to choose the second path and most shy away lieutenant girdano spc mulvihill pfc badie and pvt garcia not only accepted a challenge but they embraced it
3958014 these men without hesitation completed the most dangerous of missions their daily endeavors to save lives provided the blue spaders with freedom of movement through the most volatile province of afghanistan
3958015 i asked him how he felt about going to afghanistan and he said to me that even though he was a little nervous that he was ready and willing to go do his job wherever he was needed he also explained to me that his siblings were in the military and he was proud to be doing what he was doing
3958016 he showed genuine care and concern for those around him
3958017 you will be missed we will cherish the friendship you have put a special mark in our hearts all those who knew him will never forget him the platoon will never be the same without him
3958018 he was a very caring and loving son father and husband
3958019 he was the kind of person who knew how to brighten your bad day if you knew jair garcia like his close friends did you knew his pride and joy was his 9 year old son garcia instilled in his friends that when things go wrong you shouldnt go wrong with them he was an older guy who had a lot of wisdom about things and became a role model for many of us jair garcia is now in a place where the grass is greener and at rest he will be missed by many and missed by all
3958020 every man serves a useful purpose a miser for example makes a wonderful ancestor
3958021 sweden is famous for breaking sexual taboos so barely an eyebrow was raised when state run pharmacies began to sell over the counter sex toys this summer alongside the more conventional headache pills and hot water bottles
3958022 misguided and untrue view of sexuality whereby a woman with a dildo is seen as liberated strong and independent while a man with a blow up plastic vagina is viewed as disgusting and perverted
3958023 as i understand it there are no products of good quality on the market for men
3958024 should there be such products specifically for men then there is nothing stopping us from selling them
3958025 bars tend to use women to attract more male customers and thus lower the age restrictions
3958026 apotekets goods are made available to men and women and therefore apoteket does not break the law regarding sex discrimination

3958037 no person should be prevented from living where he or she chooses because of race or color

3958041 i wanted so much to see the national flag hoisted from the podium i tried my best
3958042 ive heard all hosts of recent olympic games failed to clinch the first gold so why should you be the exception
3958043 dont cry my hero no athlete has kept the title in consecutive games you have many opportunities in the future
3958044 we need to develop the confidence rationality openness and tolerance appropriate to citizens of a fast growing emerging nation
3958045 being a good host is both more meaningful and gratifying than merely notching up gold medals
3958046 what is important is to show china and to show beijing to the whole world

3958050 socialism in general has a record of failure so blatant that only an intellectual could ignore or evade it
3958051 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late battellino says
3958052 we try to be pre emptive when we start tightening and pre emptive when we start easing
3958053 were confident were on that path thats why were in a position to respond on interest rates
3958054 looking over the last two or three weeks the 90 day bill rates down around half a percent so thats significantly reduced the banks marginal cost of short term funding
3958055 i think that means theres no obvious reason the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate
3958056 when people started thinking i was a predator they had a problem talking with me
3958057 my probation officers said i couldnt go there on the basis that i was just sitting there hanging out well that is what you do when youre enjoying your 7 latte

3958059 it has been a heck of a struggle for him
3958060 he was distraught to open that letter seven eight years later saying that they were going to reclassify him he wanted to fight it right from the start

3958076 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

3958081 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3958082 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3958083 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3958084 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
3958085 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
3958086 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
3958087 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
3958088 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
3958089 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
3958090 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
3958091 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
3958092 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce

3958095 more than 50 children who attend the san diego cooperative charter school a county run charter school in the san diego neighborhood of linda vista and the murray callan swim school and the baldwin academy day care center both in pacific beach are being quarantined as a precaution the 10 month old baby remained hospitalized monday night but was expected to be released on tuesday
3958096 from 1987 to 2002 reports of acute measles mortality in the united states declined by 199 from 165 184 reported deaths during 1987 1992 to 1 reported death during 1993 2002
3958097 early in the 20th century measles was a universal childhood illness the annual number of measles deaths in the united states fluctuated between 2000 and 10 000 and the death to case ratio dcr the number of reported deaths per 1000 reported cases generally exceeded 10 figure 1 the number of deaths and the dcr began to decline significantly in the 1930s most probably as a result of treatments for secondary infections 1 4 improved nutrition 5 and reduced crowding 6 in the 1950s the annual dcr declined to 1 however measles remained a common illness with an average of 550 000 reported cases and 495 deaths reported each year the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 led to a precipitous drop in measles cases and measles deaths however the dcr did not change substantially figure 1
3958098 im not quite sure what you are trying to prove i said when measles does strike the victims are not so well protected as they were before what paramyxos actually said the measles vaccine had in other words minimal to zero impact on hospitalization and deaths due to measles in the us
3958099 when measles does strike its more deadly now because theres little natural immunity among adults
3958100 modern biology is characterized by a number of ideological prejudices that shape the form of its explanations and the way its researches are carried out one of those major prejudices is concerned with the nature of causes
3958101 when measles does strike its more deadly now because theres little natural immunity among adults
3958102 the quality of vaccine induced immunity is not as good as the immunity one gets from actually having had measles
3958103 incidence rates for infants were more than twice as high as those in any other age group the mothers of many infants who developed measles were young and their measles immunity was most often due to vaccination rather than infection with wild virus as a result a smaller amount of antibody was transferred across the placenta to the fetus compared with antibody transfer from mothers who had higher antibody titers resulting from wild virus infection the lower quantity of antibody resulted in immunity that waned more rapidly making infants susceptible at a younger age than in the past
3958104 nice claus so what your saying is lets just give everyone measles that way babies under a year are more immune
3958105 whats next do you want to find how many boners i get in a given day
3958106 surely you understand that if ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny a rough first approximation of course then we still have
3958107 perhaps you should suck on shyh ching los balls whats next do you want to find how many boners i get in a given day
3958108 more deadly now because theres little natural immunity among adults
3958109 none of you apologists understand the concept of a continually declining trend over the whole century or number of deaths relative to number of cases
3958110 quality of vaccine induced immunity is not as good as the immunity one gets from actually having had measles
3958111 when measles does strike its more deadly now because theres little natural immunity among adults
3958112 heck im on a roll here so why not go back to the real original argument and misrepresent that as well again again
3958113 as an emergency physician in the last 4 weeks alone i have seen the first documented case of diphtheria in australia since 1991 a case of pertussis and 2 cases of tb and all those people were not vaccinated case closed
3958114 minimal to zero impact on hospitalization and deaths due to measles in the us
3958115 have not repeat repeat not said that the decline in measles incidence and therefore of deaths after 1962 was not a result of the vaccination program
3958116 antivax people consider measles a part their childrens natural growth process
3958117 since improvements in living standard medical care nutrition etc had already reduced measles deaths by thousands what makes you think 40 years of further progress couldnt have accomplished further reduction in deaths without the vaccine
3958118 i got myocarditis why did you not give me the vaccine

3958202 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3958203 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3958204 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3958205 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3958206 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3958210 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3958211 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3958212 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3958213 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3958214 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3958215 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3958216 i would rather be a superb meteor every atom of me in magnificent glow than a sleepy and permanent planet the proper function of man is to live not exist i shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them i shall use my time

3958226 our top broadcasts tonight the events surrounding the approaching ten year anniversary of the scorpi city massacre the atrocities committed over the course of those three days are still burned into the minds of some citizens who resided here during that time
3958227 however some residents of scorpi city are doubting that the activities of ten years ago will repeat themselves this can possibly be attributed to the recent influx of new families that have not lived in the area for very long
3958228 however quite a few have decided to leave the city before the three day anniversary begins in anticipation of the danger that may or may not come
3958229 i mean werent you here about ten years ago rudy

3958263 he will be treated as a normal criminal defendant in the civil court system of this country hes a run of the mill criminal with a run of the mill crime

3958293 well why dont you tell him to give us something we can use to make our case
3958294 look hes an expert on iraq go talk to him
3958295 my goodness thats an awful lot in one letter solving so many of the white houses problems all at once
3958296 the second nugget in the book involves a supposed order from the white house to me at the cia to have my staff fabricate a letter connecting iraq with al qaida and the attacks of 9 11
3958297 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
3958298 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
3958299 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book
3958300 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
3958301 yes but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
3958302 but he didnt say that specifically i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
3958303 right im with you im with you but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
3958304 im going to trust truth at to the end of this era
3958305 i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
3958306 i have this young son hes a guy hes a smart guy hes a little bit wayward and maybe rob as a bit of an older guy maybe you could spend some time with him
3958307 well maybe well throw someone over the side maybe well open up

3958309 i have no knowledge not that i want to have knowledge not that i dug to find knowledge i have no knowledge

3958314 frankly my success and his failure are now the same things theres not going to be coexistence its putting the united states in a choice position theyve got to choose and clearly theyve chosen musharraf over me
3958315 look at my situation im now going to wash away the entire musharraf power structure because the fact is is im rising and hes plummeting thats one opponent also the jihadists are realizing that i might create a counterpoint in this whole region to bin laden so now ive got two enemies of course who have been in an unholy alliance dictatorial power messianic radicalism for many years and i have no protection why because dick cheney wont make the phone call
3958316 your safety is based on the state of our relationship make no mistake

3958323 im not going to back off this man is innocent
3958324 you know at days end if were true to our oath we dont really have enemies certainly no enemies that cant be easily defeated if we want to be secure america has to start embracing a kind of authenticity to say were not going to do back door ugly things that end up ruining our status in the world the oaths the values are strong enough if you believe in them the world will bend toward you even on the most specific issue of information that will help us be secure
3958325 well you know i let them think theyre saving me but of course im saving them
3958326 but oddly thats where the problem starts because then i say i saved you and now heres what i want and make it transactional see thats a lie

3958695 he would tell jesus everything the first angel said but would add that jesus will be sitting in the judgment seat and would separate the sheep from the goats and vengeance would be his towards all the evil doers that are soon to cause his suffering and death
3958696 jesus you are lord over all you will have eternal life and judge the good from evil but you did not need to come to earth as a human for those reasons you could have stayed in heaven and done that what you came to earth for is to save mankind so that every person that had ever lived is living or will live might be justified through your death as a payment for their sins so that every one that has faith in you might have life eternal with god in the kingdom without you they will all perish and have no hope

3958712 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3958713 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3958714 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3958715 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3958716 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3958717 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3958718 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3958719 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3958720 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3958721 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3958722 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3958723 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3958724 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3958725 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3958726 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3958727 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3958728 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3958729 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3958730 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3958731 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3958732 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3958733 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3958734 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3958735 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3958736 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3958737 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3958738 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3958739 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

3958741 the company will pump out the water and pump in sand to fill the lake
3958742 it was a public road and the toll was put on it by the previous coalition government
3958743 we did commit in 1995 to remove the toll the contract prevented us from doing that without massive payment from the taxpayers so we introduced cashback
3958744 in 2010 the concession period ends and the toll is scheduled to come off
3958745 im not going to be responsible for putting in fuelwatch that could actually put prices up and squeeze out independents senator fielding told sky news
3958746 if the rudd government is absolutely fair dinkum and they think this is going to save motorists money and the nrma in new south wales supports it then lets introduce it in new south wales and if it works then we can roll it out across the country
3958747 assistant treasurer chris bowen he comes from new south wales so if he believes its going to save motorists put it in new south wales and then well see what happens
3958748 i think the government is grasping at straws in trying to get petrol prices down
3958749 family first for two years has been saying that we should be cutting the petrol tax and that will get the petrol prices down

3958762 we know weve been told that elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards thats part of the puff pieces on them that weve seen ergo if elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards is it likely that she thinks she knows better than he does what his speeches ought to contain and what kind of things he ought to be doing strategy wise in the campaign if she is smarter than he is could it have been her decision to keep going with the campaign in other words could it be that she doesnt shut up it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk

3958776 a prenuptial agreement is an agreement between two people that deals with the financial consequences of their marriage ending all marrying couples have a prenuptial agreement it is known as divorce law however a lot of people are unhappy with the way divorce law works and prefer to take control of their lives rather than leave it in the hands of the government in these cases it makes a lot of sense to get a customized prenup getting a prenuptial agreement is particularly important in these 8 cases 1 you are much wealthier than your partner a prenuptial agreement can ensure that your partner is marrying you for who you are and not for your money 2 you earn much more than your partner a prenuptial agreement can be used in many states to limit the amount of alimony that is payable 3 you are remarrying when you remarry your legal and financial concerns are often very different than in your first marriage you may have children from a previous marriage support obligations and own a home or other significant assets a prenuptial agreement can ensure that when you pass away your assets are distributed according to your wishes and that neither your first family nor your new family are cut off 4 your partner has a high debt load if you are marrying someone with a significant debt load and dont want to be responsible for these debts if your marriage ends then a prenuptial agreement can help ensure that this does not happen 5 you own part of a business without a prenuptial agreement when your marriage ends your spouse could end up owning a share of your business your business partners may not want this to happen a prenup can ensure that your spouse does not become an unwanted partner in your business 6 to prevent your spouse from overturning your estate plan a prenuptial agreement can ensure that you estate plan works and for instance ensure that a specific heirloom remains in your family 7 you are much poorer than your partner just as a prenuptial agreement can be used to protect a spouse who is well off a prenup can also be used to ensure that the partner who is weaker financially is protected 8 if you plan to quit your job to raise children quitting your job will negatively impact your income and your wealth a prenuptial agreement can ensure that the financial burden of raising the children is shared fairly by both partners

3958811 inevitable exclusion of substantial numbers of faithful anglicans from the church of england
3958812 different decisions should be respected and supported including that of those who have come to believe that fidelity to the faith we have received means that they can no longer remain within the communion of the church of england
3958813 we are faced with apparently irreconcilable differences in matters of faith and order and it is important to try to conduct all conversations and debates in a spirit of generosity even when church dividing issues are at stake

3958821 we are proud to announce we have signed a dealer contract with transpak effective immediately for the sale of its high speed strapping machines for the print media arenas this product complements our existing portfolio and strengthens our position in post press and materials handling on a national coverage

3958823 the sc4000 is available in various configurations for the transportation distribution logistics and packaging industries as well as many other industries a stainless steel version is available for food beverage and other industries that require this standard
3958824 our distribution logistics and transport customers derive real value from these dynamic weighing systems that are designed to be integrated into solutions for freight hubs or logistics and shipping systems
3958825 we have overcome the issues normally associated with this type of chemistry where the tendency was for the cured inks to become brittle leading to cracking and loss of adhesion
3958826 the alternative has been to use costly cationic formulations that require longer curing times and limit productivity we have also overcome the potential for migration of the ink in food packaging through working within the parameters set by the major food manufacturers flexwrap can run at high production speeds and achieve as much as 70 shrinkage with very strong colours
3958827 the phenomena of adhesion on shrink films is complex in that many common free radical materials can have a solvent like effect on the surface of the film
3958828 the core formulation has been developed in conjunction with raw material suppliers and with the assistance of the printer whose improved understanding of the process is key to achieving the desired results through this partnership there has been significant progress in the understanding of the interaction of film corona treatment heat management on press and ink formulation resulting in production to a consistently high standard with the flexwrap series of inks acid and alkali resistance can also be achieved with suitable pigment selection
3958829 with no need to stack down work between processes and a vastly reduced requirement for staffing levels and floorspace the omet style of inline carton production recreates profit margins in areas where offset printing with offline converting cannot compete
3958830 our country simply cannot afford to have insecure supply of electricity
3958831 alternate reality in which theres no such thing as climate change
3958832 national argues we need fossil fuel electricity generation in order to safeguard security of supply which is totally untrue
3958833 latest figures suggest that 1520mw of new generation will be commissioned over the next four years more than twice what is required to meet the increase in demand and most of which will be renewables
3958834 however we will not let the 90 percent target get in the way of security of supply we will continue to need the constant reliability of thermal generation
3958835 the master cleanse is a really helpful treatment for people who are suffering from countless ailments with simple remedies i had this consistent uneasiness inside me due to flatulence maybe it was my eating habits which were to blame nevertheless i went in for the lemonade cleanse and suffered from a radically different lifestyle for a fortnight but in the end i do not regret a single part of it because the benefits have been many all the bloating and gas have passed and i live a happier life the changed health has perhaps had a positive effect on my attitude also because i am doing much better professionally even my colleagues have noticed a marked change in my mannerisms which seem more relaxed and comfortable to them it is indeed a highly recommended therapy

3958890 for about the last 20 years the conventional view for policy makers in washington is that any activity in the arctic and antarctic is basically related to science
3958891 i expect that sometime in the near future there will be an issuance of what they call a national security presidential directive to lay out new policy in the arctic
3958892 this will deal with more issues of sovereignty security presence and things like that

3958903 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3958904 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3958905 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3958906 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3958907 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3958913 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3958914 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3958985 to be a christian does not mean to be religious in a particular way to make something of oneself a sinner a penitent or a saint on the basis of some method or other but to be a man not a type of man but the man that christ creates in us it is not the religious act that makes the christian but participation in the sufferings of god in the secular life

3959055 i was wondering if anything is being done about the uncleanliness around the dumpsters they are horrid to walk up to do you think that this area can be power washed down at least one time soon it is also really tough having this right in front of my home smelling and being unsanitary
3959056 hello shawn thanks for responding to my concerns about your asking for volunteers to walk from 12 am 4 am maybe you have addressed my concerns and i just cant see it but i want to again say because you as president are taking the lead and direction and have asked for the volunteers to patrol the complex at the loneliest hours of the night i believe it does put us in a liable position i think the insurance did not cover any injuries incurred with volunteers and if i remember correctly our attorney at that time was also against it such programs i dont see at this time how this is like a neighborhood watch a neighborhood watch is left up to the people to patrol as they see fit please check at least with jan at goldenwest as for your response to the architectural issue you are 100 correct i will support whatever decisions the board makes you and the board will go far because unlike previous board this board is working with you and the majority all think the same even the president doesnt get what he wants unless three board members agree and vote for it i do see the board making a lot of good decisions and your leadership is very strong which is a very good thing thanks again for all you do have a good and safe day since you walk so late at night
3959057 is the monument sign going to be straightened out i thought you had said something about just removing the letters to avoid future maintenance
3959058 i just did laundry this am the last washing machine from the walk in not first is filled with crud from someones wash and needs to be cleaned out can this be cleaned out so that someone does not accidentally use it like me and ruin their load also the floor is a disaster as well
3959059 the large tree that overtakes the common area between unit 94 and 27 is hanging so low please have the landscapers trim this immediately it is in contract to trim up to 15 ft and so this should not be an additional charge to trim this foliage i am not requesting the entire tree be trimmed just the amounts hanging too low my second concern with this tree is there is significant buzzing going on in this tree when i go underneath it we cannot tell if there is a hive or what is going on up above us when we are walking we just want to keep on walking because we do not want to be stung can this be remedied immediately i thought someone would say something by now
3959060 there is a perception at present that banks are not offering mortgages in fact our latest study suggests that access to finance is not a major issue
3959061 instead many buyers are taking a wait and see attitude naturally some feel uncomfortable buying a home which may be worth less in six months time
3959062 almost one in four buyers think they might struggle to get a mortgage however just one in fifty has actually given up on their purchase due to failing to find a suitable loan

3959070 i screwed up by going out too early theres no doubt
3959071 to intercalate realities is the only way to be faithful to time for at every moment in time the possibilities are endless in their multiplicity life consists in the act of choice the perpetual reservaltion of judgment and the perpetual choosing
3959072 perhaps buried in all this there lies the germ and the substance of a truth times usufruct which if i can accommodate it will carry me a little further in what is really a search for my proper self we shall see
3959073 it is after all the serious who disturb the peace of the heart with their antics like justine
3959074 this is how i suppose one dies to ones friends and to the world wearing out like an old dance tune or a memorable conversation with a philosopher under a cherry tree being refunded into silence and finally the bird itself went into a decline and died with its head under its wing
3959075 how to harness time in the cultivation of a style of heart something like that i am only trying to express it to harness its rhythms and put them to our own use
3959076 truth is independent of fact it does not mind being disproved it is already dispossessed in utterance

3959079 how many lovers since pygmalion have been able to build their beloveds face out of flesh as amaril has
3959080 science is the poetry of the intellect and poetry the science of the hearts affections
3959081 meanwhile all this advanced the central situation not at all it was as if the action which nessim had been contemplating grew with such infinite slowness like a stalactite that there was time for all this to fill the interval the rockets ploughing their furrows of sparks across the velvet sky piercing deeper and ever deeper into the night where justine and i lay locked in each others arms and minds in the still water of the fountains one saw the splash of human faces ignited by these gold and scarlet stars as they rose hissing into heaven like thirsty swans in the darkness her warm hand on my arm i could watch the autumn sky thrown into convulsions of colored light with the calm of someone for whom the whole unmerited pain of the human world had receded and diffused itself as pain does when it goes on too long spreading from a specific member to flood a whole area of the body or the mind the only grooves of the rockets upon the dark sky filled us only with the sense of a breath taking congruence to the whole nature of the world of love which was soon to relinquish us
3959082 this particular night was full of a rare summer lightning
3959083 i no longer know when there is something to hide one becomes one actor it forces all the people round one to act as well
3959084 the same man it was true walked about on the surface of their common life the same considerate gentle punctual man but in a horrifying sense everything had changed he was no longer there
3959085 for i knew that soon it would be forgotten and revisited only by those whose memories had been appropriated by the fevered city clinging to the minds of old men like traces of perfume upon a sleeve alexandria the capital of memory
3959086 reflecting that a city like a human being collects its predispositions appetites and fears it grows to maturity utters its prophets and declines into hebetude old age or the loneliness which is worse than either
3959087 in the far corner curled up on a trunk and so still that she was invisible at first sat a very old lady smoking a narguileh which from time to time uttered a soft air bubble of sound like the voice of a dove here i thought the whole story through from beginning to end starting in the days before i ever knew melissa and ending somewhere soon in an idle pragmatic death in a city to which i did not belong i say that i thought it through but strangely enough i thought of it not as a personal history with an individual accent so much has part of the historical fabric of the place
3959088 i walked across this mirage of narrow intersecting alleys as one might walk across a battlefield which had swallowed up all the friends of ones youth yet i could not help in delighting at every scent and sound a survivors delight
3959089 at every corner the violet shadows fell and foundered striped with human experience at once savage and tenderly lyrical i took it as a measure of my maturity that i was filled no longer with despairing self pity but with a desire to be claimed by the city enrolled among its trivial or tragic memories if it so wished
3959090 this is a peculiar type of love for i do not feel that i possess her nor indeed would wish to do so it is as if we joined each other only in self possession became partners in a common stage of growth in fact we outrage love for we have proved the bonds of friendship stronger these notes however they may be read are intended only as a painstaking affectionate commentary on a world into which i have been born to share my most solitary moments those of coitus with justine i can get no nearer to the truth
3959091 something was always missing i suppose the flesh which the perfume merely costumed the undertow of the body itself was the missing factor
3959092 nessim began to experience a magical sense of relief he recognized at last that what had to be decided would be decided at this time and at no other he had the air of a man who has fought a long illness successfully
3959093 for seven long years of marriage he had repeated on every day the words
3959094 the madness itself of course took no account of circumstances
3959095 it appeared to superimpose itself not upon the personalities tortured beyond the bounds of endurance but purely upon a given situation
3959096 then the question of noises in the room next door a sort of heavy breathing and the sudden simultaneous playing of three pianos these he knew were not delusions but links in an occult chain logical and persuasive only to the mind which had passed beyond the frame of causality it was becoming harder and harder to pretend to be sane by the standards of ordinary behavior he was going through the devastatio described by swedenborg
3959097 at mealtimes he fought against his desire to touch it so feverishly that he turned pale and almost fainted

3959139 ace has never in a decade of asking for similar information from state agencies received such a response
3959140 we can only conclude that there was no announcement and no open process
3959141 weve seen that people dont stop giving when the economy is tough
3959142 weve always gone up each year but they do give more strategically because of progress and results we are seeing and can show were remaining optimistic
3959143 we have a different sales structure here the sales people just sell
3959144 we have a different sales structure here its wild and subversive
3959145 even better the sales people can focus on developing their own new business by spending more time with current clients making both the sales people and clients happier
3959146 our overall goal is to make sure that were maximizing everyones time so that the sales people are always working with relevant companies who need what we have to offer and they arent spending time with prospects that arent a good fit

3959152 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3959153 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3959154 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3959155 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3959156 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3959157 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3959158 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3959159 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3959160 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3959161 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3959162 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3959163 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3959164 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3959165 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3959174 we spent most of our time in tents playing cards talking there was no real emotion or apprehension for most of us awar was on so what thats what we had trained for whats to worry about it showed how little we know
3959175 i dont think anyone believed there was going to be another big war
3959176 but there was enough going on in europe for someone to think we ought to have a few more pilots
3959177 a single wooden propeller and you had to pump up the wheels by hand but it was marvelous it gave you everything you loved about flying and ten times more as a fighting machine no no no we still didnt think wed be using it for that it was just a superb aeroplane to fly

3959189 what we do of necessity can drag us down and all too often the repetitive and familiar become not occasions for renewal but dry stale lifeless activity when washing dishes i am no better than anyone else at converting the drudgery of the work into something better by means of playful abandon the contemplative in me recognizes the sacred potential in the mundane task even as the terminally busy go getter resents the necessity of repetition but as s ren kierkegaard reminds us repetition is reality and it is the seriousness of life repetition is the daily bread which satisfies with benediction repetition is both as ordinary and necessary as bread and the very stuff of ecstasy
3959190 of all the anguish in the world there is nothing like this the sense of god without the sense of nearness to him
3959191 people wonder why the novel is the most popular form of literature people wonder why it is read more than books of science or books of metaphysics the reason is very simple it is merely that the novel is more true than they are life may sometimes legitimately appear as a book of science life may sometimes appear and with a much greater legitimacy as a book of metaphysics but life is always a novel our existence may cease to be a song it may cease even to be a beautiful lament our existence may not be an intelligible justice or even a cognizable wrong but our existence is still a story
3959192 christian believe this and think on it thou shalt be externally embraced in the arms of that love which was from everlasting and will extend to everlasting of that love which brought the son of gods love from heaven to earth from the earth to the cross from the cross to the grave from the grave to glory that love which was weary hungry tempted scorned scourged buffeted spit upon crucified pierced which did fast pray teach heal weep sweat bleed die that love will externally embrace thee
3959193 through your own merciful dealings with me o lord my god tell me what you are to me say to my soul i am your salvation say it so that i can hear it my heart is listening lord open the ears of my heart and say to my soul i am your salvation let me run toward this voice and seize hold of you do not hide your face from me let me die so that i may see it for not to see it would be death to me indeed
3959194 ecclesiastes calls you the all powerful the maccabees call you the creator the epistle to the ephesians calls you liberty baruch calls you immensity the psalms call you wisdom and truth john calls you light the books of kings call you lord exodus calls you providence leviticus sanctity esdras justice the creation calls you god man calls you father but solomon calls you compassion and that is the most beautiful of all your names
3959195 there are good things going on in the wider world and we must join in while always remaining on the lookout for the point where we will be asked to do something that goes against the grain of the gospel there are wicked things going on in the wider world and we must stand out against them while always remaining on the lookout for the point where we become mere dualists retreating from the world which is already charged with the grandeur of god all this is difficult enough at the best of times and all the more so now because we in the west have simply not thought in these terms for a couple of hundred years once again william wilberforce and others like him have something to teach us and suddenly all those shrewd remarks of jesus come home to roost it is time to figure out what it will mean in the real world of the twenty first century to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves
3959196 justification by faith means that i have nothing else on which to depend except my receptivity to which i can never own or manage and this capacity to receive cannot be the result of effort faith is something given not achieved it is created by gods word in christ

3959241 the message being sent to security forces is that violence and indiscipline are acceptable and thats a very dangerous thing
3959242 russian georgian and south ossetian forces all have an obligation under international humanitarian law to protect civilians from attack
3959243 the latest information on civilian casualties in gori tskhinvali and surrounding areas calls into question whether the forces are respecting that obligation
3959244 in a couple of seconds from everywhere i heard what sounded like massive gunfire we fell on the ground and some people never got up
3959245 the circumstances suggest that russian forces either carried out the attack on gori or at least should know of an attack by south ossetian forces
3959246 russia clearly has the duty to investigate this incident as a potential war crime and hold those responsible to account
3959247 they had no pity for civilians when the fighting started everyone who remained in the building rushed to the basement we stayed there for the next two days unable to step outside because the shelling was so heavy on august 9 a bmp infantry fighting vehicle fired right into the basement leaving a gaping hole in the wall the noise was deafening and debris was flying all over the place my neighbors elderly father in law was so scared that he started running away slipped and broke his legs no one was killed because everyone was in the adjacent room
3959248 they were shooting from grad rocket launchers paying no attention to civilians living in these houses we went deaf from the shelling they simply wanted to wipe us off the face of the earth
3959249 we burned these houses we want to make sure that they the georgians cant come back because if they do come back this will be a georgian enclave again and this should not happen
3959250 the day before yesterday august 11 2008 the georgians killed two of my soldiers in the village of tamarasheni we had been conducting a sweep operation there we detained three of them two of them didnt do anything to us so we just let them go we couldnt take them anywhere as i had to take care of my own men first the third one seemed to be high on something a normal person would have surrendered and this one was shooting at us instead we questioned him and then executed him
3959251 we make out of the quarrel with others rhetoric but of the quarrel with ourselves poetry
3959252 in terms of the scope and international dimension of this attack its a landmark
3959253 international laws are very poorly developed so it really crosses a line into murky territory is an information blockade an act of war

3959275 but we are also pros and we can fairly review rough cuts presentations and shows with cast changes
3959276 ive never had a situation like this fall where i dont have a shows pilot yet the good part is weve got a strong solid script we understand the tone and style and where its going but we want to make sure were promising something that the show delivers

3959295 i dont know why but i had a shaky confidence
3959296 i was not satisfied with his day one score of 93 i went back and watched video of myself at last years italy world cup he set a finals world record and i said why am i not doing that it pisses me off when im shooting like that the second day i was still a little shaky but i had my confidence back
3959297 i use that energy to keep me calm it looks like im going crazy out there
3959298 no doubt and no fear can creep into my head
3959299 everyone that said dont expect to win just fueled me

3959310 but if most parents are truly honest with themselves theyd admit that there is an ulterior motive in play namely that no one wants to foot a 100 000 bill for college when someone else will pick up the tab its the same reason that children with a musical gift get toted to band practice or that kids with a knack for art develop that skill its the obligation parents have for their children to give them the best life possible

3959318 the quest for genuine human security must be rooted in international human rights standards basic and hard won standards for the just treatment of all people everywhere all the time and under all circumstances no exceptions this is especially true in times of danger and public anxiety when governments use so called necessity to justify the abuse of some people often those who are already the targets of discrimination

3959325 should i be satisfied with this excuse alas ill probably have to be i always have to make do i came into the world with a beautiful wound that was all i was furnished with

3959329 the bipartisan leadership of the u s house of representatives stands united in condemning in the strongest possible terms the recent russian invasion of the sovereign state of georgia
3959330 the united states is committed to georgias absolute sovereignty and we reject the russian foreign ministers reported assertion that democratically elected president mikheil saakashvili must go
3959331 this morning russian president dmitri medvedev stated that russia will cease military action in georgia and now moscow has a responsibility to follow through and remove russian troops from the country
3959332 in the meantime the international community must remain vigilant in ensuring that the nations territorial integrity is restored this deplorable outbreak of violence should serve as an opportunity for the world community to re engage in negotiations to end the conflict and restore stability in this region we also need to strengthen our efforts to ensure that the needs of georgia and the georgian people are met
3959333 russian military action in georgia should be recognized for what it is an effort to intimidate georgias freely elected government and the governments of other democratic states on russias borders as well
3959334 it must be made clear to russian leaders that this kind of conduct is unacceptable
3959335 as the former chairman and a long time member of the helsinki commission i have spoken out for decades in support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia a crucial ally of the united states
3959336 russias actions violate georgian sovereignty and should be vigorously condemned by the international community russia must halt all military operations and withdraw their troops immediately
3959337 the united states congress stands strongly with our georgian allies and their democratically elected government
3959338 russias aggression marks an important moment for the international community for the sake of democracy in the region and free nations across the world the international community must speak with one voice in condemning the actions of moscow and calling for the removal of russian troops from georgia furthermore we must remain committed to ongoing dialogue to promote peace stability and democracy in the former soviet republics
3959339 over the past week georgias long term stability and territorial integrity have been challenged by moscow while i am encouraged that president medvedev announced a halt in operations his government must immediately remove its troops from georgian soil and reassure the international community that his nation will respect its borders
3959340 furthermore i want to make it abundantly clear that the u s congress stands ready to assist the people of georgia and protect our nations strategic alliance
3959341 we have more and more choices for an increasingly bewildered consumer and an increasingly bewildered user in terms of industries and universities
3959342 and to be frank the thing is a complete dogs dinner
3959343 i think what you have to do is focus on the building blocks knowledge in itself is fine but the actual transferable skills are what matters and i think we have to strengthen those at every level
3959344 you cant imagine how delighted i am to see you my friends
3959345 give our visitors something to change into and by the way i will change too only i must first go and wash for i almost think i have not washed since spring wouldnt you like to come into the bath house and meanwhile they will get things ready here
3959346 i have got a nice bath house as you see my father built it but i somehow never have time to wash
3959347 he was a gentle good natured fellow and i was fond of him but i never sympathized with this desire to shut himself up for the rest of his life in a little farm of his own
3959348 my brother nikolay sitting in his government office dreamed of how he would eat his own cabbages which would fill the whole yard with such a savoury smell take his meals on the green grass sleep in the sun sit for whole hours on the seat by the gate gazing at the fields and the forest
3959349 country life has its conveniences he would sometimes say you sit on the verandah and you drink tea while your ducks swim on the pond there is a delicious smell everywhere and and the gooseberries are growing
3959350 he used to draw a map of his property and in every map there were the same things a house for the family b servants quarters c kitchen ga rden d gooseberry bushes
3959351 her first husband had been a postmaster and with him she was accustomed to pies and home made wines while with her second husband she did not get enough black bread she began to pine away with this sort of life and three years later she gave up her soul to god and i need hardly say that my brother never for one moment imagined that he was responsible for her death money like vodka makes a man queer in our town there was a merchant who before he died ordered a plateful of honey and ate up all his money and lottery tickets with the honey so that no one might get the benefit of it while i was inspecting cattle at a railway station a cattle dealer fell under an engine and had his leg cut off we carried him into the waiting room the blood was flowing it was a horrible thing and he kept asking them to look for his leg and was very much worried about it there were twenty roubles in the boot on the leg that had been cut off and he was afraid they would be lost
3959352 my brother began looking out for an estate for himself
3959353 we embraced each other and shed tears of joy and of sadness at the thought that we had once been young and now were both grey headed and near the grave he dressed and led me out to show me the estate
3959354 oh all right thank god i am getting on very well
3959355 he was no more a poor timid clerk but a real landowner a gentleman
3959356 i know the peasants and understand how to treat them he would say the peasants like me i need only to hold up my little finger and the peasants will do anything i like
3959357 and all this observe was uttered with a wise benevolent smile
3959358 but the point just now is not he but myself
3959359 and he ate them greedily continually repeating ah how delicious do taste them
3959360 i saw a happy man whose cherished dream was so obviously fulfilled who had attained his object in life who had gained what he wanted who was satisfied with his fate and himself
3959361 that night i realized that i too was happy and contented
3959362 i too at dinner and at the hunt liked to lay down the law on life and religion and the way to manage the peasantry
3959363 i went away from my brothers early in the morning and ever since then it has been unbearable for me to be in town i am oppressed by its peace and quiet i am afraid to look at the windows for there is no spectacle more painful to me now than the sight of a happy family sitting round the table drinking tea i am old and am not fit for the struggle i am not even capable of hatred i can only grieve inwardly feel irritated and vexed but at night my head is hot from the rush of ideas and i cannot sleep ah if i were young
3959364 dont be calm and contented dont let yourself be put to sleep while you are young strong confident be not weary in well doing there is no happiness and there ought not to be but if there is a meaning and an object in life that meaning and object is not our happiness but something greater and more rational do good
3959365 im not going to be responsible for putting in fuelwatch that could actually put prices up and squeeze out independents senator fielding told sky news today
3959366 if the rudd government is absolutely fair dinkum and they think this is going to save motorists money and the nrma in new south wales supports it then lets introduce it in new south wales and if it works then we can roll it out across the country
3959367 assistant treasurer chris bowen he comes from new south wales so if he believes its going to save motorists put it in new south wales and then well see what happens
3959368 i think the government is grasping at straws in trying to get petrol prices down
3959369 family first for two years has been saying that we should be cutting the petrol tax and that will get the petrol prices down
3959370 the rudd government should come out of the closet they should come out and support that now
3959371 at least 74 servicemen were killed 171 were wounded and 19 are missing in action as of wednesday morning
3959372 sporadic sniper attacks are continuing and although the russian side is supposed to remain within the boundaries of peacekeeping activity we must respond to such provocations as was unambiguously announced by the commander in chief
3959373 the operation was halted not because president george bush had made a request but because the goals set by the russian president had been attained
3959374 this role cannot be doubted it has been and will be played scrupulously
3959375 he seems to be still worrying that the principles coordinated with the french president contain nothing of the kind instead russias role as a peacekeeper is affirmed there
3959376 on the whole the world has the correct perception of what is going on

3959381 it caused a huge amount of controversy at the time because by some of the models that we had run the deal was going to bankrupt google like jonathan rosenberg actually got up on the table and jumped up and down about how much we shouldnt do this deal because google was going to go bankrupt we had models one said that we were going to go bankrupt one which said we might break even and one year into the deal what we saw was that by signing aol and broadening the reach of our advertising network we attracted so many more advertisers and rpms revenue per thousand pageviews went up across the network and we outperformed our expectations by a factor of two maybe even three times

3959409 points to a lapse in the companys risk management and control process
3959410 in addition the growing scope of riskier unregulated activities a financial profile that has improved but still lags our expectations and the likelihood that the companys discretionary cash flow position will remain negative through 2009 contributed to a downgrade
3959411 this company is not generating cash and yet most investors if you were to ask them would tell you that theyre valuing the company based on forecasted cash flow
3959412 i would simply caution people to understand those numbers better before making a commitment
3959413 it definitely made things difficult for awhile as far as getting in and out of here

3959448 there is little doubt that the significant decline in inflationary expectations in august is associated with the steep fall in crude oil prices over the last month he said

3959451 if the rudd government is absolutely fair dinkum and they think this is going to save motorists money and the nrma in new south wales supports it then lets introduce it in new south wales and if it works then we can roll it out across the country

3959458 in terms of a grades in 2002 it was 20 7 and in 2007 it was 25 3

3959476 we are concerned that any toxic contamination is being allowed into the lake but certainly it should not be happening just a few kilometers from port hopes municipal water intake
3959477 we hope the contamination indicates a very recent breakdown in the treatment system and that cameco quickly repairs it
3959478 god help the lake if its been going on for 40 or 50 years
3959479 winter ice is the only force that could have uprooted that pipe and sliced it open and that means it has been spewing uranium and arsenic onto the beach for four months
3959480 it shouldnt be left up to an individual to detect leaks from cameco or to uncover the inadequacies of the cnscs licenses in light of whats happened in the last year this company simply has to do a better job of eliminating its pollution of lake ontario canadians and americans who take their water from the lake should be outraged this has got to stop

3959502 early release of terminal or infirm inmates without a doubt saves tremendous amounts of tax dollars
3959503 the taxpayer simply cant afford to pay exploding end of life health care costs
3959504 the release of the inmates is in the sole power of the prisons commissioner theres no telling who we will have heading the prison system 10 or 15 years down the road there needs to be more controls in place
3959505 its particularly important that victims be notified that the offender has been released so victims are aware of the release and can take feasible steps to protect themselves
3959506 those were offenders of lesser crimes if i recall they got involved in drugs once they were released
3959507 people are more sensitive to fuel prices in the summer than at other times of year
3959508 we have a higher percentage of discretionary driving in the summer vacation plans more weekend trips maybe a trip to the beach
3959509 as gas prices slide back people will react for sure
3959510 many will stick with changes theyve made but that will be a small percentage most of these folks as soon as they get the opportunity to go back to where they were before they will

3959529 certain actions be taken to prevent fatigue cracking on critical areas of the forward pressure bulkhead which could result in rapid decompression of the aircraft fuselage
3959530 not a safety issue my arse these aircraft may have been flying for up to five years with missing parts
3959531 it fails to take into account that qantas as is always the case received the approval of boeing and casa for this work before it was undertaken
3959532 all modifications qantas performed on the boeing 737 aircraft were to a standard specifically approved by boeing and casa
3959533 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past regular lubrication and checking of the jack screw is vital because corrosion poses a real risk and must be eliminated to prevent this key component from seizing up
3959534 boeing issued a directive that this component needed to be checked more rigorously and more regularly
3959535 there was a maintenance issue involving the lubrication of a jack screw on a boeing 747 400 qantas found this through a routine check of our maintenance records
3959536 the jack screw had been inspected and the aircraft will operate tomorrow
3959537 there is no connection at all with any other aircraft incident
3959538 the alaska incident involved a different aircraft type and design with different safety features
3959539 i have absolutely no time in my schedule to address this idiocy so sorry
3959540 if you cant get it to me by todays deadline you can get it to me by mid day tomorrow compromise the information im asking for i dont have access to so i really need to rely on you to provide it to me in order to comply with the countys requirements if we dont this entire proposal would be considered non compliant and we would not be considered for the project ive tried to make it as painless for you as possible by providing the most information as i can but i do need and appreciate your collaboration it should just take about a half hour at the most of your time

3959549 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3959550 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3959551 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3959552 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3959553 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3959554 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3959555 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3959556 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3959557 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3959558 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3959559 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3959560 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3959561 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3959566 wow great but im really too busy now on a certain business planning document blah blah will catch up later etc
3959567 check my upcoming vodcast or podcast for details on the latest spoiler on this and this show
3959568 honestly i really dont know how i should feel since im the first to have done it
3959569 obviously im really excited the state open really means a lot to me its becoming one of my favorite events to play
3959570 i knew if played well today i would have a good chance
3959571 i was four strokes back but only four strokes back from one guy its easier to overcome one person than it is two or three others i go out there every round to shot as good a number as i can
3959572 i put a good amount of time into my short game
3959573 my chipping is getting to the point now where its adequate i had some key up and downs this summer which kept me in some tournaments my course management is also to the point where i know my game i know what risks i can take and which risks are not worth the reward
3959574 how is it possible that i look forward to it so much and yet i fear it so much why am i built this way why is it that i seem to be my biggest stumbling block in my journey towards obtaining eternal joy and happiness
3959575 you use your hands so much when you hiit and i just wish my hands were healthy just to see what i could do
3959576 i know what kind of talent patterson has and id like to give him a chance

3959580 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
3959581 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3959582 they were driving in a land cruiser with a clear irc logo on it
3959583 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3959584 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3959585 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3959586 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan
3959587 humanitarian workers should be protected by the principles of neutrality and impartiality and must not be targeted as they appear to be at present in afghanistan
3959588 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3959589 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3959590 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
3959591 we were the unlikeliest lot and that is precisely why god has chosen us
3959592 poderia ser outra forma de arte mas achamos que o cinema mais acess vel

3959598 the judges decided to hold me and i guess i just let my nerves get the best of me
3959599 i have to put my mind in a little box and ignore the bad things going on around me
3959600 they have tested me four times and took a lot of blood
3959601 im saying they are taking so much blood i might be very weak for the saturday finals of the 100 meters
3959602 asafa told me i took a lot of pressure off him
3959603 i feel ready for the crowd the stadium and the atmosphere i am going there to win the gold medal and have been working for this goal so long now it is all i think about i wont be fazed when i get there
3959604 you look back and he did phenomenal things at 14 15 16 17 years old
3959605 aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups this year there have been more than 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the past six years the report said
3959606 so far this year 19 ngo non government organization staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
3959607 is definitely increasing and it is spreading to areas where there was relative security last year
3959608 they the taliban do not care about the ordinary people of afghanistan they have their own agenda
3959609 definitely over this year the security situation has been worsening for both the civilians and humanitarian workers
3959610 i couldnt speculate whether they were targeted because they were irc or because they were the first westerners to go through there or were in the wrong place at the wrong time
3959611 i mean all of those things are possible speculations im sure everyone there over the next few days is going to be doing security assessments just basically looking at those questions
3959612 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
3959613 in afghanistan there is a severe drought there is war and the people are being displaced and they need humanitarian assistance
3959614 something has to be done with security by the international community and also from the government of afghanistan
3959615 we anticipate these trends to continue into the next quarter
3959616 with abduction and murder by contracted criminals being the no 1 threat to non governmental organizations
3959617 she was concerned i think that with the military doing more humanitarian work there comes a blurring of the lines and there is a danger of making humanitarian workers targets or seen as legitimate targets by people like the taliban
3959618 especially with children we used to joke that i have to compete with the millions of girls who go without school because of conflict
3959619 my sister was one of the few people who were happier in places without electricity or running water
3959620 she felt a true calling to completely give herself to great causes afghanistan needed humanitarian assistance so thats where she went
3959621 she would have probably gone to afghanistan on her vacation if she could
3959622 the whole area of education in emergency situations is a relatively new one
3959623 dr kirk is one of a relatively small number of specialists in the world who have been developing this area
3959624 she was definitely the more outgoing of the two of us
3959625 hey we lost to togo who we going to lose to next
3959626 diving isnt here to support canada on its own the games have just started its still happening people are still training and still competing

3959628 i know no canadian taxpayer wants to hear that i really did try my best i really did give everything i had
3959629 its always going to be a fight to win a medal and thats the beautiful thing about sport
3959630 this guy wanted it so bad for him to turn around and do what he did for the team i would be a proud dad if i was his dad
3959631 hes doing his job for mike i dont want mike to feel he owes the world anything
3959632 about as frustrating as it gets fourth place is probably the worst place to get at an olympics obviously i would have loved to have a medal the first medal for canada would have been awesome to have i couldnt pull it through but that doesnt mean we wont be having one soon
3959633 see rickard on my left and i could see kitajima on the other side of me i was trying to get rickard i knew it was close it was anybodys game at the commonwealth games it was my day i got to the wall quicker
3959634 im trying not to worry about winning a medal i need to focus calm down after the race and get ready im a great swimmer i came here to put in a strong performance to get to the final and i did it
3959635 there are signs that the overheated market might finally be cooling the commerce department for example said sales of new homes in october fell shy of expectations median prices declined 5 7 and the number of new homes for sale shot up to a record 493 000 most real estate agents and economists are not forecasting a real estate collapse although some doomsayers say the bursting of the bubble is inevitable
3959636 the us housing market is continuing to deteriorate after a string of figures today showed a larger than expected drop in the sales of new homes along with a fall in the prices of existing homes
3959637 through this decade and right up to 2020 i want us in environmentally friendly ways using principally brownfield land and building eco towns and villages to meet housing need by building over a quarter of a million more homes than previously planned a total by 2020 of 3 million new homes for families across the country so for england we will raise the annual house building target for 2016 from 200 000 to 240 000 new homes a year

3959641 there really isnt a more fitting spot for this museum than new york the hometown of hall of famers like the velvet underground paul simon and blondie
3959642 if you can make it through the training camp the hard part is done
3959643 so its kind of like why make it through training camp and stop now you made it through the hard part the fun part is about to start im looking forward to that and hopefully being a part of the turnaround that we can have this year
3959644 ive been very critical of javon throughout this camp and throughout the off season
3959645 but hes had a string right here of the best practices hes had he looks to be in the right frame of mind lately so if we can continue to work on that and push that its going in a positive direction
3959646 im finally putting everything together as far as what they want and how they want it to be done
3959647 now i can start adding my twist to it and going out and playing football
3959648 im just looking forward to these games and getting out there and doing it
3959649 its kind of like mr davis said he wanted me on his side because i had a lot of success against the raiders every time playing them so im just happy to be on this side and do it against somebody else
3959650 the only thing that we know for sure is that it is a bruise
3959651 its a bruise with a possible sprain so weve got to make sure its not broken
3959652 my main thing is even if its broken it doesnt mean anything
3959653 if i can go out there and play then i can go out there and play if something hurts something hurts i got to try to get to the bottom of it
3959654 if he doesnt play super mario would start for us
3959655 and that will be interesting vs vanden bosch kyle titans defensive end
3959656 its hard to absorb that information at first and then when you do you panic
3959657 what really surprised me is how thankful i was for what i do have
3959658 when i went to camp i saw a lot of kids with the same thing i had but they had amputations
3959659 i think this accentuated her character but it was there
3959660 we knew we would just have to fight it harder
3959661 im really looking forward to not being treated so special
3959662 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3959663 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3959664 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3959665 the saddest day i came across was when i learned that life goes on without me
3959666 if everyone has someone else then i aint got nobodys love to save me
3959667 i think ill pass away tonight cause it seems ill never get it right its just me
3959668 im turning into someone that i never thought id have to be again
3959669 the saddest day i came across was when i learned that life goes on without me
3959670 if everyone has someone else then i aint got nobodys love to save me
3959671 i think ill pass away tonight cause it seems ill never get it right its just me
3959672 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3959673 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3959674 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3959675 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3959676 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3959677 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3959678 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3959679 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3959680 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3959681 from now on for every 1 american artists single i buy ill buy 3 uk
3959682 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3959683 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3959684 many children are intuitively sensitive to people close to them a child who is in her heart can know when a parent or buddy needs a kind word a hug or some friendly conversation
3959685 i earned the right to hang up on you when i divorced you
3959686 i gonna kill u if u dont treat her well
3959687 just to not make him play especially when i was serving for that first set
3959688 set point for him match point for me it went so long there were long rallies and some amazing balls
3959689 the situation the murray darling basin is in at this present point in time is clearly dire
3959690 and that would be particularly notable for people at the bottom end of the system particularly those in south australia and adelaide
3959691 we need action and it needs to be based on information
3959692 there is good information that the water is available and can be transferred down the river
3959693 we need the authority of the senate to say to the government you are wrong the water is available heres where it is and heres what it will cost
3959694 im sure nick will be behind it im sure family first steve fielding will be behind it im sure the coalition will be behind it
3959695 i cant believe that anybody in the senate including government senators would not want to support urgent action
3959696 time for action times up kevin rudd time for the coorong to get the water it needs
3959697 no one is under any illusions how hard this is

3959703 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3959704 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community help the poverty hit afghan people
3959705 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3959706 nothing can justify such an attack on people whose lives are devoted to helping the people of afghanistan
3959707 humanitarian workers should be protected by the principles of neutrality and impartiality and must not be targeted as they appear to be at present in afghanistan
3959708 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3959709 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3959710 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
3959711 the fall in the price of petrol has only been about half of what it would have been had the australian dollar been unchanged against the us dollar in the last month
3959712 at the moment energy prices are falling faster than the australian dollar is falling so there is still a net favourable impact on inflation
3959713 fundamentally the australian dollar is driven by commodity prices and domestic interest rates expectations for both are moving down
3959714 the americans have to learn how to lose even when they think they are right
3959715 i have to point out that transport in the second graph would include shipping as well as private motorists so much of this may be commercial usage rather than residential then again we can reduce that by change our consumer habits and buying locally
3959716 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practice their love with women all across this country

3959721 the science which proves to us that the earth is not the centre of the celestial movements has struck a great blow at religion
3959722 sains telah menunjukkan bukti kepada kita bahwa bumi bukanlah pusat tata surya dan ini merupakan pukulan hebat terhadap agama kristen
3959723 religions are always based on miracles on such things than nobody listens to like trinity yesus called himself the son of god and he was a descendant of david i prefer the religion of muhammad it has less ridiculous things than ours the turks also call us idolaters
3959724 surely i have told you on different occations and i have intimated to you by various discourses that

3959869 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
3959870 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
3959871 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir

3959887 lets face facts theres four players most of us bank with the four players and they are all the same
3959888 its a cosy club as soon as one hikes rates up the rest follow thats a cosy club theres not really effective competition at all

3959893 id wager that passive aggression probably coincides with the rise of polite society
3959894 you look like the one with no emotional control so you actually need to rise above it
3959895 people who use indirect aggression on a continual basis lose credibility and respect
3959896 speak to them face to face because passive aggressive people are not as brave in that situation
3959897 dont be aggressive but be very assertive cool and adult and dont do it in front of everybody as youll publicly embarrass them

3959899 the constitutional compatibility of applying this procedure to child witnesses and victims of violent crimes especially sexual offences is questionable and may not be in the best interests of the child
3959900 there was no suggestion that any consideration had been or was given at any stage to the question of whether she should be allowed to testify through an intermediary the impression is created that there was no intermediary available at the pretoria north regional court so the court the prosecution and the defence regarded it as useless to investigate whether a 13 year old might be in need of such assistance
3959901 its very much the procedure for 15 year old girls to appear before the accused
3959902 i have worked with these 15 year olds and i know their trauma the ignorance of the court personnel makes me furious
3959903 so situated that any person whose presence may upset that witness is outside the sight and hearing of that witness

3959907 if you havent seen the show you owe it to yourself to do easily the best show to come out of network tv in possibly forever
