6720012 this is great news for yemen which has recognised the value of tourism especially in some of the more deprived rural areas that are so rich in cultural and natural heritage
6720013 following unescos inscription of the socotra archipelago often described as the galapagos of the indian ocean yemen now has the largest number of world heritage sites in arabia we are already talking to leading british operators about opportunities for developing programmes in yemen particularly in places like socotra that offer some of the finest and least known diving in the world and the old city of sanaa at an altitude of more than 7 000 feet which has been inhabited for more than two and a half millennia and contains more than 6 000 houses that date from before the 11th century there is a real opportunity here to support the growth of tourism in yemen as a tool of economic development and to encourage british visitors to contribute to yemens development by going to enjoy its magnificent cultural and natural heritage this is also great news for british tour operators and we therefore look forward to sitting down with operators at world travel market in november as in any less established destination visitors should of course take sensible precautions but this really is brilliant news for responsible british travellers
6720014 yemen has been in our programme since 1992 we therefore welcome this change and confirm that yemen will be in our brochure for 2009
6720015 our clients always feel entirely safe and exceedingly welcome travelling around the country with our highly experienced guides and drivers
6720016 this is very good news whilst our clients tend to be more experienced travellers and understand the challenges of visiting less established destinations it is always encouraging when the foreign office goes some way towards reflecting the reality on the ground and confirms that the country is as safe a destination as many others in the world today
6720017 the feedback from british visitors is invariably excellent i hope that many more people from britain and ireland will come to experience our beautiful country

6720021 peacekeepers at special checkpoints in the quantities needed to ensure security will remain
6720022 we have to understand the essence of what this means to have checkpoints in and around georgian territory by russian forces
6720023 it means there will be an effort by the russian federation to continue to make sure that the georgian economy is never rehabilitated
6720024 there are some checkpoints where one day they are federal troops and the next day peacekeepers

6720067 i told one of my tenants to accompany me and we went to ovwian
6720068 as soon as we entered the room i called out anita and the baby turned round and looked up i said this is my daughter
6720069 we were in church in the children section and anita was crying so i tried to keep her quiet
6720070 i took her to my mummy who asked that i put her on my back which i did
6720071 as i carried anita a lady walked up to me and asked if i was really a sister to the baby and i said yes she then offered to assist me in keeping the baby calm and took anita from me

6720073 we are calling on all well meaning nigerians with useful information as regarding the killing of mr paul ogundeji member editorial board of thisday to avail us with the information to enable us bring the perpetrators to book we will also want to use this opportunity to appeal to those peddling false information about the unfortunate incident to desist from it as it will not do the deceased any good other than create unnecessary distractions in the investigation this is the life of a promising young nigerian we are talking about i want to also say that those carrying such fallacious rumours will go to hell because liars can never make heaven
6720074 we sympathise with the management of thisday as well as the wife of the deceased we pray that god should give them the mind to bear the loss
6720075 the man is still alive and has recounted his ordeal in the hands of the robbers from all indications the man has told us what happened his car was snatched and no other interest other than for his car to be recovered he is around and you can ask him whatever questions you feel like
6720076 it happens to be that some policemen had a hand in it i will not hesitate to parade him for the world to see i am a christian and a believer of the gospel of god i have done that in the past and i will not fail to do so if it happens that he was killed by policemen
6720077 i think that by the time we recover the morano jeep then we may be getting to the bottom of the entire case those in possession of the car will tell nigerians how he or she got the vehicle
6720078 as the one driving chose to go through the dopemu bridge others said they should go through the lagos abeokuta way and as they attempted to enter the next lane the deceaseds car ran into my morano as he struggled to recover control of the car
6720079 it was the mere fact that he had dented the morano jeep that got the robbers angry and said they would destroy the kia

6720202 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6720203 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6720204 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6720205 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6720206 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6720207 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
6720208 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
6720209 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6720210 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6720211 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6720212 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6720213 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6720214 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6720215 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6720216 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6720217 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6720218 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6720219 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6720220 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6720221 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6720222 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6720223 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6720224 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6720225 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6720226 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6720227 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6720228 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6720229 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6720230 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6720231 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6720232 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6720233 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home
6720234 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6720235 to put it plainly t boone pickens is out to save america
6720236 he asked if we could we join together and do something i told him no because global warming is on page two for me
6720237 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6720238 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6720239 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6720240 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6720241 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6720242 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6720243 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6720244 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6720245 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6720246 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6720247 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6720248 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6720249 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6720250 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6720251 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6720252 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6720253 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6720254 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6720255 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6720256 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6720257 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6720258 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6720259 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6720260 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6720261 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6720262 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6720263 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6720264 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6720265 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6720266 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6720267 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6720268 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6720269 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6720270 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6720271 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6720272 the fundamental basis of this nations laws was given to moses on the mount the fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from exodus and st matthew from isaiah and st paul
6720273 i dont think we emphasize that enough these days if we dont have a proper fundamental moral background we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state
6720274 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
6720275 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6720276 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6720277 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6720278 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6720279 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6720280 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6720281 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6720282 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6720283 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6720284 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6720285 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6720286 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6720287 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6720288 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6720289 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6720290 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6720291 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6720292 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6720293 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6720294 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6720295 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6720296 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6720297 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6720298 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6720299 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6720300 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6720301 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6720302 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6720303 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6720304 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6720305 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6720306 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6720307 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6720308 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6720309 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6720310 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6720311 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6720312 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6720313 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
6720314 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6720315 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6720316 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6720317 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6720318 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6720319 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6720320 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6720321 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6720322 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6720323 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6720324 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6720325 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6720326 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6720327 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6720328 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6720329 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6720330 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6720331 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6720332 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6720333 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6720334 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6720335 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6720336 no trippin we just have to stop dumping raw feces and piss into the ocean simple
6720337 i didnt know what to expect some kind of moonscape perhaps but it was incredible huge matrices of branching porites coral up to 8 meters 25 feet high had established creating a thriving coral reef habitat
6720338 throughout other parts of the lagoon it was awesome to see coral cover as high as 80 percent and large tree like branching coral formations with trunks 30 centimeters 12 inches thick
6720339 it seems like you won approval from all who write bs on every subject every day the know it alls stay true to yourself never change to please others or to fit in
6720340 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6720341 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6720342 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6720343 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6720344 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6720345 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6720346 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6720347 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6720348 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6720349 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6720350 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6720351 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6720352 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6720353 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6720354 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6720355 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6720356 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6720357 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6720358 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6720359 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6720360 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6720361 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6720362 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6720363 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6720364 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6720365 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6720366 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6720367 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6720368 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6720369 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6720370 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6720371 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6720372 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6720373 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6720374 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6720375 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6720376 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6720377 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6720378 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6720379 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6720380 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6720381 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6720382 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6720383 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6720384 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6720385 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6720386 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6720387 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6720388 wat ik niet zal doen is klagen over mijn rechtszaak of de mishandeling door de overheid of john markoff
6720389 het ging nooit om het geld of de gratis telefoongesprekken het ging om de uitdaging van het verkennen
6720390 vandaag de dag geven ze computerbeveiliging op school en mensen denken dat als ze een cissp examen halen ze weten wat ze doen
6720391 ich bin wie man sieht nicht mehr der h bsche bursch der ich mit 20 jahren einmal war als mann bekommt man mit 65 noch hauptrollen angeboten
6720392 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6720393 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6720394 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6720395 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6720396 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6720397 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6720398 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6720399 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6720400 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6720401 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6720402 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6720403 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6720404 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6720405 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6720406 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6720407 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6720408 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6720409 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6720410 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6720411 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6720412 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6720413 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6720414 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6720415 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery

6720419 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6720420 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6720421 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6720422 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6720423 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6720424 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6720425 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

6720465 apparently the uk is the worlds sixth largest importer of water this it is claimed is affecting drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future as such we are now being asked to factor in our water footprint to our daily shop businesses are likewise being urged to evaluate their water footprints and take steps to reduce water consumption needless to say a much simpler solution would be to treat water supplies as an economic good by making water demand less independent of users willingness to pay for it

6720511 i have been treating low back disc bulges and herniations using the drx 9000 spinal decompression machines in our clinic since 2004 i still here from patients who treated with us 4 years ago who continue to be pain free it is my experience at least to date that this treatment has great longevity but i also differ from doctors who are using the spinal decompression medical technology only i believe that spinal decompression when used in conjunction with a comprehensive cutting edge low back strengthening and rehabilitation program gives the patient the greatest opportunity to sustain the benefits of this treatment correct posture spinal muscle strength stability and flexibility along with increasing the strength and co ordination of core muscle stabilizers is vital to offset disc pressures that can lead to re injury i would go as far as to step on a few toes and say that if rehabilitation following spinal decompression is not apart of the treatment program then the doctor has failed in his responsibility to the patient
6720512 i wanted to thank you for helping me with my back pain and in strengthening my back i was particularly pleased that dr mountain does the exercises with his patients back pain is a very debilitating condition and too many doctors and knife happy surgeons prey on people who suffer with this malady you have a program that works i hope you get the word out that there is an alternative to back surgery
6720513 the spinal decompression program which includes 20 visits on one of our drx 9000 true spinal decompression systems followed by 6 or 12 low back spinal strengthening sessions one on one with a doctor working out on our state of the art rehabilitation equipment our program also includes a 6 month follow up and maintenance package 5 office visits over 5 months reviewing and developing your home exercise program on the 6th month 5 days 1 week of decompression therapy all of this 7 8 weeks of intensive treatment with a 6 month follow up goes for between 4800 5800 the price variance depends on choosing 6 or 12 rehabilitation sessions and how you pay for the program

6720534 quite happy to hear that many of the 77 cases have been resolved through dialogue and communication
6720535 for those who want to protest as long as their problems get solved its good enough
6720536 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
6720537 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
6720538 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
6720539 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
6720540 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause
6720541 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
6720542 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused
6720543 there are holes in this story that you can drive a truck through

6720547 if water had been available it is likely that sprinklers would have operated and the building may still be here today
6720548 it looks like they want to wrap up this investigation and blame the collapse on normal office fires

6720552 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately we see those forces now having advanced on to the soil of georgia georgian territorial integrity is in question here
6720553 we did not want to see a recourse to violence and force and we made that very very clear
6720554 the fact that we were trying to convince the georgian side not to take this step is clear evidence that we did not want all this to happen
6720555 we have seen the destruction of civilian infrastructure as well as calls by some russian politicians to change the democratically elected government of georgia some question the territorial integrity of georgia that is why we believe that russia has gone too far

6720652 there is a fear panic and desperation that i have not seen in this population before
6720653 this is a population that would rather pay their taxes than buy their medications
6720654 it is a different mind set than the baby boomers that will follow
6720655 its this quiet desperation where people are almost forced to ask for help that wouldnt otherwise
6720656 they have to humble themselves and that desperation has chipped away at that good old yankee pride
6720657 we have never had a food pantry for just the elderly
6720658 we put one together this year because we had a tremendous amount of calls in the last month we wanted to get some things implemented before the cold weather
6720659 tutti quanti e tutti iniziano a cantare anke da morti evviva tornato topo gigio
6720660 you have to ask yourself why are they giving him all this money
6720661 we cant ignore that we need to find alternative sources
6720662 my own heart right now says drillings not the answer
6720663 if we do that theres no doubt in my mind that everyone benefits in the long run
6720664 theres no doubt in my mind individuals know how to spend their money better than government
6720665 start throwing money back into peoples pockets and into the economy
6720666 i really do believe there are a lot of people out there that are tired of incumbents and want some fresh ideas
6720667 preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
6720668 tutti quanti e tutti iniziano a cantare anke da morti evviva tornato topo gigio
6720669 negli occhi della gente si vede quello che vedranno non quello che hanno visto
6720670 ma quanto vive luomo vive mille anni o uno solo vive una settimana o pi secoli per quanto tempo muore luomo che vuol dire per sempre
6720671 toglimi il pane se vuoi toglimi laria ma non togliermi il tuo sorriso dura la mia lotta e torno con gli occhi stanchi a volte daver visto la terra che non cambia ma entrando il tuo sorriso sale al cielo cercandomi ed apre per me tutte le porte della vita
6720672 alcuni dicono che la pioggia brutta ma non sanno che permette di girare a testa alta con il viso coperto dalle lacrime
6720673 e credere in te soltanto giurare in te soltanto riporre in te soltanto la mia fede la mia forza il mio orgoglio tutto il mio mondo tutto quel che sogno e tutto quel che spero
6720674 vorrei tornare bambino perch le ginocchia sbucciate fanno meno male di un cuoreinfranto
6720675 sussurra al mondo ci che sei ma urla a te stesso per capirti
6720676 ho perso il mio angelo custode vuoi essere tu adesso
6720677 bella arriverei ad odiare me stesso se dovessi farti del male il pensiero di te immobile bianca fredda di non vederti pi avvampare di rossore di non poter pi cogliere la scintilla nel tuo sguardo quando capisci che ti sto prendendo in giro non sarei in grado di sopportarlo
6720678 preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
6720679 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
6720680 affordability plays its part but the desire to wait and see how low prices will go is another important factor
6720681 the fact the rates are comparable means there is still some way to go between where they are now and where they should be
6720682 since the credit crunch lenders have been demanding bigger deposits and raising rates to the point where the market has become ridiculously quiet
6720683 uk mortgage lenders actions have been like putting the breaks on a super tanker that has finally halted

6720687 but you learn from your mistakes and it was something i learned from
6720688 i talked to the right people and clarified everything and got everything out in the open with them
6720689 in an ideal world you have to reduce the size of the squad and the wage bill
6720690 we cant keep bringing players in but some players have no intention of moving anywhere they are guaranteed to sit there and see their contracts out
6720691 theres one or two of those at every club they are going nowhere unless real madrid come in for them
6720692 ce qui ma fait craquer chez pierrot cest surtout son physique son calme et son respect que je nai retrouv chez aucun homme

6720694 everyone is aware of the quality that martin has and he is a great outlet for us on that left hand side
6720695 in fairness the vast majority of our attacking has come down that flank and we need to keep him fit and well and playing in the right areas with a ready supply of passes that he can work with
6720696 if we can do that then he will be a real threat
6720697 martin shows his feelings on the field maybe his aggression is not all that it could be but we accept that is not the strength of his game
6720698 he will be a key player for us this season i am sure of that i remember the game last season when blackburn came to eastlands and martin gave the full back sleepless nights with his performance
6720699 he ripped him to shreds and ran the game for the first half and we will be looking for more of that
6720700 he is an exceptionally talented footballer and we have to make sure we keep getting him in the right areas of the pitch
6720701 fair play to him he was able to focus his mind very quickly and was ready to go and he led the line with great energy and acquitted himself well given the circumstances
6720702 over the last two years this team has gone to the well again and again and its difficult to keep winning game after game
6720703 you do tend to learn more from a loss physically we had to improve after the munster final and weve done that but the championship was always going to be about the all ireland this year
6720704 our model suggests that there is a second cell of air in each hemisphere which is characterised by air rising clouds forming storms developing and other processes associated with moisture in the air occurring in the mid latitudes
6720705 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques the genetic data were the key to our finding two species one on each side of the isthmus
6720706 its an opportunity for us as hp to explain what it means to sell hp and what our portfolio is about
6720707 we want to bring it back to what it means to the sales guy on the ground
6720708 customers want advice direction and clarity of purpose from partners we help educate people to let them understand what the propositions are were the only vendor that can do full end to end thats a value to them and they can focus on hp and lead with confidence
6720709 commitment to the channel we are the channel player we have been forever and will continue to be were the safe house
6720710 a great way to cover off the huge portfolio hp has and to deliver information in a way that wasnt death by powerpoint
6720711 high energy prices have led to an increase in biodiesel production which in turn has led to an increase in the amount of crude glycerol in the market
6720712 we have shown that it is possible to use the crude glycerol byproduct from the biodiesel industry as a carbon source for microalgae that produce omega 3 fatty acids after thorough chemical analysis we have also shown that the algae biomass composition has the same quality as the commercial algae product
6720713 the results so far have been promising the fish fed the algae had significant amounts of omega 3 fatty acids
6720714 pakistan is fully committed in the war against terrorism and committed in the peace process to resolve all outstanding issues with india
6720715 there is no change in the policy on kashmir and composite dialogue
6720716 we have been enormously impressed with the quality of and experience of the organisations that expressed an interest in these major contracts for crossrail it is clear that crossrail has excited the construction industry and we look forward to working with the very best talents to ensure that crossrail is delivered on time and on budget
6720717 history is hidden in this ancient city we have so far found many things and this is the beginning of excavations
6720718 when the work finishes we will have significant information about the history of city structures of that period
6720719 fibrosis is a disease of many organs lungs kidneys pancreas prostate skin its possible this mechanism in the liver is relevant to fibrotic situations in other tissues
6720720 once a lot of extracellular matrix has formed its very hard to clear the material just sits there and creates an inflammatory environment

6720722 osim ako op im aktom nadle nog tijela op ine grada i grada zagreba nije druga ije odre eno
6720723 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6720724 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6720725 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6720726 the impact of climate change on human and global security could extend far beyond the limited scope the world has seen thus far
6720727 water supplies stored in glaciers and snow cover in major mountain ranges such as the andes and himalayas also are expected to decrease
6720728 most critical for human survival are water and food which are sensitive to changing climatic conditions
6720729 environmental changes caused by global warming will not only affect human living conditions but may also generate larger societal effects by threatening the infrastructures of society or by inducing social responses that aggravate the problem
6720730 the associated socio economic and political stress can undermine the functioning of communities the effectiveness of institutions and the stability of societal structures these degraded conditions could contribute to civil strife and worse armed conflict
6720731 large areas of africa are suffering from scarcity of food and fresh water resources making them more vulnerable to conflict
6720732 other regions of the world including the middle east central asia and south america also are being affected
6720733 these rat model tumours were developed from human glioblastoma tumour cells and closely mimic human tumours in growth patterns and response to therapy
6720734 the concept of targeting blood vessels that feed tumours as an approach to limit tumour growth is not a novel idea however blocking the specific fatty acid described in this study is novel and holds great promise for use in humans
6720735 these pumps have been used in humans for other diseases and can be designed for delivery of these drugs as well we believe they can be used to deliver drugs to block angiogenesis in complex human tumours such as glioblastomas
6720736 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
6720737 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
6720738 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
6720739 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
6720740 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job but it got remodeled
6720741 with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies
6720742 sperm whales go to where their food source is and that means very deep water so folks that do see them are marine mammal observers who ride the seismic survey vessels and the workers on the big oil and gas rigs and even that does not happen often
6720743 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
6720744 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
6720745 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
6720746 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
6720747 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
6720748 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
6720749 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
6720750 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production
6720751 hectic lifestyles and long working hours means brits are now going to bed later than ever before
6720752 trying to unwind at the end of the day can be difficult when you feel pressure to do chores in the home cook dinner exercise or catch up with loved ones
6720753 making time to fit everything in can prove difficult and getting to bed late can become inevitable when you do get to bed quality sleep is essential to ensure you feel regenerated and ready for the day ahead
6720754 interruptions caused by emotional or health problems can be very detrimental to everyday life making it harder to concentrate at work and maintain a positive attitude

6720761 im staying upbeat and thinking that in the circumstances i am just delighted that i passed i had already forgiven ruby so im not going down that road of being angry at her again i know she didnt do it on purpose

6720780 decided to complete a financial restructuring through a pre packaged bankruptcy

6720783 the restructure and packaged bankruptcy should lead to a stronger entity in the usa which will benefit the global mrs fields network

6720798 the knee injury happened during the first game of pre season i was a bit frustrated because the same thing happened to me last year when i was injured in the pre season as well
6720799 it was a difficult moment for myself but i came through and hopefully now it is all finished and i can have a good season like last year
6720800 in the end it has been one month out it is not that big a problem
6720801 it is better if i compare this years injury with last year when it was my eye and i couldnt do anything for three weeks i was just sitting at home and couldnt even watch the tv
6720802 hopefully now everything is behind me and i will stay injury free all season my fitness level is not a problem but i didnt play any pre season games and that is difficult

6720894 does anyone besides me find this astounding now everyone knows she has devoted and loyal supporters that she ran an impressive race for the white house and that president clinton deserves the appropriate respect for his service to our country and our party i will be the first to empathize with the clinton team i personally know the pain of my candidate losing the race trust me it is hard and requires some adjustment to the loss dean and gephardt supporters knew such intense feelings in 2004 bill bradley jerry brown paul tsongas all head a long list of people who ran impressive and passionate races and withdrew putting the interests of the democratic party first none of these candidates required any of the above plans this kind of schedule is unprecedented and is fraught with trouble does anyone really believe that the media wont become obsessed with comparisons the size of her roll call vote the size of crowds her entrance into denver and her exit from denver the entire convention will start revolving around the clintons instead of our nominee winning in november and getting started with unity and power this is just wrong our party can be very proud of having two frontrunner candidates one a woman and one black who fought for the nomination it was a hard contest and in the end obama won the democratic convention will for the first time in history be nominating an african american for president of the united states this should not only be obamas moment but a special moment for african americans the democratic party and all americans there are plenty of ways hillary can be honored and acknowledged for an incredible race but this exceeds all decency and boundaries known to this party no words of praise for obama from the podium can correct the distraction and mixed message that she is sending with this calendar can she not have the grace to honor his moment at a crucial juncture before we enter the general election

6720911 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event
6720912 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down
6720913 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of wtc 7
6720914 hundreds of degrees below those typically considered in current practice for fire resistance ratings
6720915 while the partial or total collapse of a tall building due to fires is a rare event we strongly urge building owners operators and designers to evaluate buildings to ensure the adequate fire performance of the structural system of particular concern are the effects of thermal expansion in buildings with one or more of the following features long span floor systems connections not designed for thermal effects asymmetric floor framing and or composite floor systems
6720916 we recommend that building standards and codes be strengthened beyond their current intent to achieve life safety by preventing structural collapse even during severe fires like this one when sprinklers do not function do not exist or are overwhelmed by fire
6720917 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain
6720918 what followed in rapid succession was a progression of structural failures failure first occurred all the way to the roof line involving all three interior columns on the most eastern side of the building then progressing from east to west across wtc 7 all of the columns in the core of the building failed finally the entire fa ade collapsed
6720919 sound level of 130 to 140 decibels at a distance of half a mile
6720920 while debris impact from the collapse of wtc 1 initiated fires in wtc 7 the resulting structural damage had little effect in causing the collapse of wtc 7

6720922 if a victim comes into the station to report a rape incident the police officers assist them by taking them to the victim support unit which makes it easier for victims to open a case and get trauma counselling and medical assistance
6720923 the help offered to the victims through partnership within the departments and ngos makes a huge difference for the victims to overcome their problem follow ups are also being made by visiting the victims to ensure that justice has prevailed and check ups whether further assistance is needed
6720924 the partnership makes it easier for the victim not to be sent from pillar to post but receive all services under one roof i encourage the victims to make use of the police station as they are there to help them but mostly it is their right to do so
6720925 the shelters provide services to victims of gender based violence especially women referred by the saps and social workers
6720926 if our partners police and social workers realise that it is not safe for the victim to go back home they send them to us for accommodation at the shelters where they stay between one week to three months
6720927 if the programme can be implemented effectively by the departments victims of gender based violence could get assistance anytime they need it and wont find themselves in the shelters or living in the same house with the perpetrator
6720928 you dont have to go to school to be aware of the abuse take note of everything no matter how little it looks even a little push

6721140 at the beginning we went fairly frequently probably went two or three times a month when we had malia our first child we went less frequently and that probably continued for a couple of years just because i dont know if youve had the experience of taking young squirming children to church but its not easy as they got older we would go back a little more frequently probably twice a month
6721141 lets see if this experiment school vouchers works and if it does then whatever my preconceptions my attitude is you do what works for the kids

6721147 when planning for a year plant corn when planning for a decade plant trees when planning for life train and educate people
6721148 success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm
6721149 setting a goal is not the main thing it is deciding how you will go about achieving it and staying with that plan
6721150 i plan to go to boracay beach on april 15 this year with my family we are going to stay for a whole week we will take philippine airlines via kalibo our hotel will be at waling waling i am really looking forward to this vacation i have been saving for a year to make this happen it is going to be really fun
6721151 our goals can only be reached through a vehicle of a plan in which we must fervently believe and upon which we must vigorously act there is no other route to success
6721152 the more you practice what you know the more shall you know what to practice

6721158 while cancelling the bush tax cuts for upper income groups is certainly the right thing to do i would not use the proceeds to finance a tax cut for middle class people
6721159 both for urgent needs now and for future deficit reduction
6721160 the government needs that money and ought not to be using it to promote consumption consumer spending
6721161 cest insupportable mme sarkozy na rien faire dans cette histoire l
6721162 so many people i speak to are frustrated with the party system they dont believe government is listening and do not believe they have a voice numerous people wish to preserve the values which made britain the envy of the world
6721163 they are not against progress but cannot identify with the policies of the current political parties which appear to do everything possible to destroy the british way of life
6721164 im not pushing for another party im offering a banner which is all about opposition bringing the government to account
6721165 im looking for people to stand at elections people who may only have one policy for example on keeping the local hospital reducing excessive taxation or ridding us of speed traps
6721166 there will be no manifesto party mandate whips or greasy career ladders
6721167 we just want to harass the government into listening to and acting on the electorates views to secure britains future
6721168 i have no political or financial ambitions but am strongly motivated to help people have their say if we can get enough people involved government will have to take notice of us
6721169 we are not going to sign this memorandum of agreement in its present form
6721170 with due respect to the supreme court government in the executive department would like to make this very very clear and there should be no nuancing about this
6721171 they are going to have to do a sit down to keep a lid on the situation and get a conversation going again they will have to do that relatively soon
6721172 the opposition doesnt want arroyo to be able to accomplish anything and will use any kind of issue of giving away territory giving away mineral rights to lambast her and just dig their heels in

6721176 we are absolutely delighted there wont be a 150 charge for people having a boards
6721177 it has probably saved four jobs here when rotosign went into administration we bought it up to the black country and we get lots of business from wolverhampton
6721178 we charge about 1 800 for an a board and it has been a very useful acquisition for our sheet metal business manufacturing isnt always easy to be in and the a boards help shore our core business up
6721179 every so often someone knocks on my door and asks where it is
6721180 the stone circle will have been here for thousands of years friends and locals remember it clearly up to about the late 1960s somebody must be responsible for it being removed and for the sake of heritage someone must be made to reinstate it
6721181 in the late 1960s there were definitely 12 there it was a perfect stone circle it offends me that children should be denied things like this it was riddlesdens stonehenge
6721182 it was a bit enigmatic its a few stones even reports in the 1930s described it as very damaged

6721199 we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into what have been a number questions and apparent discrepancies on this case
6721200 the eligibility of the athletes has already been investigated and authorized by the international federation and if they hadnt been cleared they wouldnt have participated in the games
6721201 our athletes participating in these games all conform to the age regulations of the olympics

6721212 great wealth of talent passion and energy in our yn committees we plan to take those committees forward form new ones and engage with the thousands of young people out there who believe in charity
6721213 it is a fine example of the lay leaders of the future taking up the baton of supporting communal charities it is to their credit and norwoods benefit that yns members have become an essential part of the charitys fundraising activity
6721214 as one of the fastest growing communities in the uk we are extremely excited to have rabbi scharf and his wife devorah leading us
6721215 we are confident that their inspirational approach to torah education and community development will motivate the alei tzion community to grow further within our new us family
6721216 a truly modern orthodox zionist community alei tzion is a place where members care about one another and are welcoming to others it is a community that is growing both physically and spiritually thanks to the leadership of its lay leaders and rav tabory
6721217 its an honour to continue the spiritual development of such a young vibrant and learned community
6721218 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is sic going to solve the sectarian violence there
6721219 by and large whats left of the insurgency is just trying to hang on
6721220 the simple fact is that sending in over 20 000 additional troops isnt the answer in fact its a tragic mistake
6721221 it wont deter terrorists who have a completely different agenda it wont rein in the militias
6721222 the group will focus on education religion and social justice
6721223 the surge was designed to give the iraqi government time to take steps to ensure a political solution
6721224 this war is lost and the surge is not accomplishing anything
6721225 the united states is now winning the war that two years ago seemed lost
6721226 in baghdad parks are filled every weekend with families playing and picnicking with their children that was unthinkable only a year ago
6721227 and we have to have a big enough surge that we can get baghdad under control and then anbar province under control
6721228 loved going into the fire engine and seeing all the equipment
6721229 but what makes it a better deal is that if the temporary seatholder takes up shul membership at any time between september and march next year their first years subscription will be reduced by the full price of the temporary seat
6721230 ive never worked with a campaign that was more interested in what the research shows
6721231 it was here at town and country plaza 8 years ago in the final months of wilson robertsons last term in office when according to county documents his painting company was paid 11 900 to put one coat of paint on a 21 000 square foot space in this complex
6721232 nor shall a public officer or employee acting in a private capacity rent lease or sell any realty goods or services to the officers or employees own agency
6721233 the cost of eggs is up 14 percent cereal and breads are up nearly 10 percent fresh fruits and vegetables also jumped 10 points while meats and poultry prices have climbed 5 5 percent higher this year
6721234 if you throw a rock in the water you would see a ripple effect i would say this is a tsunami weve thrown a mountain in the water
6721235 theres been an unbelievable reception at all the venues and it has really kept us going
6721236 i wanted to get people involved without them feeling they were expected to give a donation
6721237 we have averaged about 10 miles a day and its been very tiring weve needed plenty of rest breaks and a few gin and tonics
6721238 there are a lot of like minded people here and this has given them a voice we have been exchanging ideas and views as we have walked along
6721239 when you walk you cannot help talking to people so it is good to have interaction the way to get communities together is to get people in contact with each other in a regular way not just with rabbis talking to imams
6721240 politicians disease on both sides is to imagine they have far more influence than they really do on the economy
6721241 the debt boom the housing boom and the spending boom they all go together
6721242 it is largely the consequence of people in the economy households and companies
6721243 but was the treasury a cheerleader i think the answer is yes
6721244 if it wasnt for oil we could cut interest rates
6721245 households real problem is negative income growth from high inflation not that they are saddled with debt
6721246 he could have mentioned leaning against the wind as an example of practising inflation targeting in the annual letter confirming the remit each year
6721247 people say that if the public finances had been better managed then the government would be able to respond more readily to the slowdown but theres always a trade off between monetary and fiscal policy
6721248 our corporate tax system has become too burdensome too complex and too changeable to provide the right environment for british businesses
6721249 if we had the labour market of the 1970s i think inflation would be 20 per cent not 4 per cent
6721250 politicians disease on both sides is to imagine they have far more influence than they really do on the economy
6721251 its an absurd waste of resources to once again try to justify their paranoia
6721252 if you desire to become a fort lauderdale police officer your character must be beyond reproach
6721253 the dilemmas of free trade are reminiscent of churchills famous assessment of democracy the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time
6721254 proving that protectionism makes the world poor or that free trade makes it rich is problematic
6721255 having such a lovely home and for looking after residents so well ive been speaking with many of them and thank you for what you do

6721259 create as large a repository as possible of real time metrics data from windows pcs all over the world whos running what and how its performing
6721260 these users are not necessarily representative of windows vista users as a whole
6721261 per our longstanding practice allowing downgrade rights enterprise customers and purchasers of windows vista ultimate or windows vista business editions can choose to downgrade to windows xp professional if they feel they need more time to get ready for windows vista
6721262 we found that 65 percent of the boxes pre loaded with vista were still running it and the rest were running windows xp
6721263 either manually wiped the drive and installed xp or paid the vendor to uninstall vista and install xp it blows you away that people will pay not to have the default operating system
6721264 getting metrics about your pc is not the kind of thing grandma would want to do
6721265 contrary to the recent devil mountain software survey windows vista momentum is getting stronger and stronger
6721266 the really good news is that once people get here you are overdelivering on peoples expectations by a huge margin
6721267 although people perceive you in a negative way the challenge is to correct those perceptions youve got the ammunition
6721268 image has been a challenge for arkansas since territorial days when arkansas was viewed as a lawless really rough place
6721269 we made some strides in image but there is a lot more to go
6721270 advertising is not just a cost it actually returns things to the state that the state can use
6721271 its difficult for us to get on the list when a company is looking to locate in a new place it is mainly because of the image problem
6721272 we made the list because of our attractive incentive we were one of 20 locations in three months they narrowed the list we were aggressive and timely and we were one of those where they visited once they visited us they were blown away
6721273 i looked at it as an image investment because hewlett packard coming to arkansas is not the usual thing it changes our image in the technology world
6721274 i was interested to see what it was because ive worked with a team of people involved in monitoring and forecasting aphids those of greenfly and their relatives in this country
6721275 i looked at it with my team and we thought we could identify it down to the level of genus but we had no idea what the species was
6721276 he went into the pond hoping to be blessed when a crocodile attacked him and dragged him into the deep part of the pond kabir said
6721277 this is a very unusual incident normally the crocodiles are very friendly and do not harm people
6721278 these instances get attention because they cut against the grain the trend is overwhelmingly in the other direction
6721279 its very possible for a well meaning manager to shove the employee out of the corporate jet without a parachute
6721280 there was a time when real estate developers would not have considered building in an area with this kind of reputation
6721281 now we see more and more of them doing it and i really dont believe it will stop any time soon
6721282 its not at all surprising to see developers targeting these areas
6721283 particularly in older cities in europe and asia the red light district is where you often find many historic buildings and architectural landmarks and thats a very attractive selling point to builders and investors
6721284 home prices in the district have risen about 40 per cent in just the past year and a half
6721285 when one or two well regarded developers go into areas like this buyers and brokers begin recognising its potential
6721286 in years past you had a much wider distribution of property prices when developers ventured into undesirable areas
6721287 property developers see financial opportunity in these areas so they invest with the idea of actually getting a better than expected return on their money
6721288 the aggressive escalation of investment in these areas is a considerable shift for developers
6721289 they are beginning to see an opportunity and trying hard to exploit it
6721290 the developers dont care about the integrity of the area or its people
6721291 clients who come to us dont come here for expensive hotels and houses
6721292 there are very few brothels here that attract wealthy men so these new buildings will be out of place and probably hurt our business
6721293 just a few years ago the place i bought was abandoned
6721294 the area is changing fast and i really felt that if i waited longer to buy something id probably be priced out of the area
6721295 a red light district may seem trendy now but what happens in a few years when home prices dont appreciate
6721296 buyers wanted to get in on the ground floor of these projects but today i think some of them are worried about their investments

6721298 im sure that the management of zenit will soon offer arshavin a contract extension
6721299 and the new conditions i think will be more advantageous than previously
6721300 if the footballer accepts zenits terms he is hardly going to be going anywhere anytime soon even though at tottenham the footballer would have earned more money than he possibly could at the st petersburg club
6721301 the english club had until wednesday to respond either to raise the transfer fee for andrei from 22 million to 25 million euros as zenit demanded or to drop their offer
6721302 in summation at about 16 00 the london club called me and explained that the arshavin issue was now closed after that i contacted aleksandr dyukov president of zenit and informed him of the tottenham managements decision
6721303 i have written to gunns today advising them that they will need to formally ask for an extension of the environmental impact management plan process because it seems to be the case that they wont be able to meet the current deadline of october four
6721304 in terms of the final result here i think that there is uncertainty
6721305 if you look at our evolutionary wiring we have to conclude that we are not designed to have happiness as our natural default state
6721306 nor can happiness be grown beyond its natural proportions like some weird looking specialised insect mandible
6721307 what we see as culture in general that empyreal realm of straining ideas might never have arisen
6721308 a turbulence of heart that results in an active questioning of the status quo
6721309 constantly cheerful stone agers would have lolled about grinning while their wounds festered their crops died and bears devoured their children
6721310 human beings did not get where they are today by being sanguine about imperfection
6721311 the meek would have no world to inherit if the more petulant did not set about building one fit to last
6721312 complaint is a secular humanist act it is resistance against the idea that suffering is our divinely ordained lot and that we can do no more than put up with it piously
6721313 like a libertine who wants his innumerable conquests to be chaste virgins
6721314 the price we pay for our advance in civilisation is a loss of happiness
6721315 young people should be presented with two options you either earn or learn welfare payments should not be an option for people under 21
6721316 you can get more on cdep than working for comalco rio tinto aluminium
6721317 the government is very committed to ensuring we provide every bit of support we can for indigenous jobseekers in order to close the gap between indigenous and non indigenous people that are in work but we will not treat australians differently
6721318 in too many organisations people are not treated as important assets and it seems particularly insincere and inappropriate when managers persist in saying they are
6721319 it turns out that i was wrong money is our most valuable asset employees are ninth
6721320 the conclusion one has to reach based on this is that most boards are nuts
6721321 because they do in fact usually have their cfo present but not their head of hr
6721322 in an hc centric organisation it is impossible to separate talent from business strategy
6721323 chi meglio di me in formula 1 solo alonso e raikkonen
6721324 we spoke to andrew and made him our best offer
6721325 we have given him time to go away and consider that offer and are awaiting his response
6721326 i have no indication at present as to what way he is leaning but i do hope to have an answer from him by the weekend
6721327 the offer is on the table and it is up to andrew if he wants to come and play for linfield
6721328 we are down to basically 16 players which is enough to field a team and fill the bench
6721329 i have already had to play steven douglas out of position at left back this season with conor hagan on the right and now i have lost both of them
6721330 we will adapt to the situation and bring some players in and deal with the injuries we have as we have always done
6721331 alan came to training last night suffering with a toothache and an absess
6721332 he is in a lot of pain he has been in pain while in scotland and he hasnt slept
6721333 it is the measure of the man that he still turned up at training although he went home without taking part
6721334 he is hoping that he can play on saturday but i will have no concerns if stuart addis has to start
6721335 i was pleased with him on tuesday night and his application and attitude have been first class since he came to the club in the summer
6721336 more information has come to light that did point to discrepancies
6721337 we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further with the national chinese federation if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into as to why there is a discrepancy
6721338 i dont care what other people say i want other people to know that 16 is my real age
6721339 when he qualified he said to me that the one fight he wanted was shiming in front of his home crowd and now its happening i am just so proud how could i not be
6721340 i always knew he would make it to the olympics and i always knew he was something special
6721341 it is going to be hard fighting the world champion in his own backyard but its what paddy wanted
6721342 i was very confident when he went out that he would do well
6721343 even though the polish guy had beaten him before it did not surprise me when he won
6721344 paddy has been working on his tactics so when he won 11 5 it shows you that he has been going ok
6721345 hes the fifth individual kid from the holy family club to win an olympic medal its the icing on the cake
6721346 youd want a fistful of pebbles to hit this guy
6721347 i have been ill with the usual sort of colds and ailments that affect most people but these have always coincided with leave time if i felt ill i worked through to the end of my weeks shift and then took my time off to recover
6721348 people now say to me that i must have a huge bank of sick leave owed to me and that i should take it in the run up to retirement but i am not like that my mother and father brought me up not to take days off work that was their outlook and that is mine also
6721349 we were also baggage handlers and we marshalled the aircraft when they landed at the airfield i even placed the chocks under the aircraft wheels
6721350 the year after starting i went to teeside for further training as a fireman and as time went by new civil aviation authority regulations meant that we were no longer allowed to do other duties
6721351 i would get up around 4 45am when i am on the early shift and i find those early mornings are catching up on me
6721352 from when i was in short trousers i was interested in aviation and when i go to britain i would often call into other airfields and talk to the people working in air traffic control i find that helps if i ever have to contact them again in the course of my work they can put a face to the name
6721353 one of the aviators there sort of took me under his wing when he realised how interested i was i learned how to refuel the aircraft and learned some of the safety aspects of aviation i was also a message boy for the people working there but i loved it
6721354 i am not really interested in formula one racing but rather european and british touring cars championships and formula ford classes
6721355 i really love the excitement of those races and of course when i am in england for the races i can also visit other airfields so i get the best of both worlds
6721356 a doctor once told me to avoid the three ss stress salt and sugar i have stopped taking salt and sugar and i dont know what it is like to be stressed maybe the air traffic controllers who have to constantly monitor flights in their area feel stress but i dont
6721357 its been very frustrating for all of us over the past couple of weeks because all we want to do is play football
6721358 the first week was bad enough because we were in the dark a bit when the referees went on strike and then of course with last saturdays game there is nothing you can do about the weather
6721359 we have just been trying to keep ourselves ticking over looking after ourselves as sportsmen should and just make sure we are ready for the next match whenever that comes and whoever it is against
6721360 it was great for us to play against newington on tuesday because as you can imagine we just wanted to play and it was a good exercise for us
6721361 it gave the manager something to think about and something to work on
6721362 we scored a few goals but probably should have scored a lot more so we know we have to be more clinical in front of goal and its the same for us at the back we conceded a poor goal from a set piece so we have to work on that
6721363 but a big thing that came from it was that it gave us the hunger to go out there and really get started in the league
6721364 we are really looking forward to it because of what has happened over the past few weeks and all of us are dying to get out there the league is the pinnacle in football here and that is the most important competition for us
6721365 i think its pretty clear that there is going to be a fixture pile up somewhere along the line but everyone has to deal with that
6721366 i think if our game hadnt finished last week and for example linfields against cliftonville had then we could have been playing catch up without a ball really being kicked
6721367 over the past couple of years we have found it really difficult agisnt them and lost down there recently as well
6721368 paul kirk has put together a very good side and they are really going to be up for it as well
6721369 they will take a lot of points off teams this season and i think they will be up there near the end
6721370 but we are up for this too and we are all looking forward to what i think will be a very good game of football

6721375 while success has been achieved in some areas these results show that more can still be done to improve workplace safety
6721376 weve made tiny steps weve managed to get an extra two weeks employment for these people whove been stood down during the school holiday period
6721377 on monday the accident and emergency capability of that hospital will be closed and we see no prospect of it being reopened
6721378 you require a certain level of competence to operate an accident and emergency service as of monday that wont be there
6721379 if we continue to have staff shortages then it will go longer than we would like but like every organisation that provides healthcare services particularly the services from nursing staff its just a difficult issue to fill all our shifts
6721380 i have written to gunns today advising them that they will need to formally ask for an extension of the environmental impact management plan process because it seems to be the case that they wont be able to meet the current deadline of october four
6721381 in terms of the final result here i think that there is uncertainty
6721382 ive actually been approved by the government to play a show
6721383 ive already sold 10 000 tickets there so i will be going to put on a concert for the fans
6721384 they tend to you know sometimes not want western artists in their country
6721385 i respect that but at the same time theres people that listen to music there and want to see their idols and stuff so its all good ive been approved by the government and im going to go put on a show and have fun
6721386 we should be in the top 10 to 15 countries in the world and we have plans to rectify the situation but its not going to happen overnight weve embarked on a programme that will see us deliver tangible results
6721387 between sydney in 2000 and athens in 2004 r60 million was spent on preparing our athletes during the same period australia spent some 485 million australian dollars r3 6 billion
6721388 were noticing the change now but it started very long ago because of mismanagement
6721389 south africa hasnt invested in sport for the past 10 to 15 years every other country has shown that if you invest you get results
6721390 if you want to be competitive you have to be serious and professional in south africa were so arrogant we think we can put the athletes on a plane and they will win gold
6721391 there are going to be a lot of the public out there who will criticise us and say we suck and were useless and there will be some who will understand but they should know were not funded like the americans australians and europeans
6721392 there has to be a systematic approach to our olympic sport
6721393 sascoc is going to have to look at prioritising different codes and giving them extra assistance in terms of finance and administrative support
6721394 begin mei was ik op vakantie op hainan een tropisch eiland in het zuiden van china
6721395 binnen anderhalve maand na het bezoek aan hainan heb ik mn winkel geopend dat hield in een plan geschreven vergunningen uitgezocht locatie gevonden verbouwd inventaris aangekocht smaken bedacht alle design etc aardig wat en dat terwijl ik ook nog eens stage liep van zon 45 uur per week
6721396 omdat het een nieuw gezond lekker en vers product is voor een goede prijs
6721397 ik denk dat er zeker een markt is voor bing ijs de plannen worden nu uitgewerkt
6721398 de investering voor mijn winkel in nederland zal toch wat groter zijn dan die in china dit kan ik nu nog niet zelf ophoesten maar hopelijk heb ik over een tijdje hier in china genoeg verdiend zodat ik zelf vanuit de winkel de uitbreiding kan financieren
6721399 niet echt maar ik ben me wel goed bewust geweest van de mogelijkheden die china te bieden heeft
6721400 een fantastisch land iedere dag is anders je maakt zoveel mee en china heeft zoveel meer mogelijkheden dan nederland hier kun je een idee gelijk uitvoeren in nederland is het veel lastiger als je alleen al naar alle vergunningen kijkt die je in nederland nodig hebt hier kon ik binnen twee weken een winkel openen
6721401 ik heb er al een heleboel een handje gegeven maar met de nederlandse zeilsters en judoka deborah heb ik echt gepraat die kennen mn naam nog wel
6721402 im certainly excited to be getting back out there with the boys because i hated missing brno
6721403 ive been doing all the old voodoo stuff they tell you to do bone stimulators lasers ultrasound all that stuff im doing everything possible to get back i had hoped my progress would be quicker
6721404 i still need crutches at this stage but unless something goes south i definitely plan on trying to ride ive been seeing doctors and im going to get something moulded to wear in my boot ive been doing some training in the pool and a few things at the gym nothing too crazy

6721417 if i had my way id leave town for the weekend
6721418 im not anti harley im just not into the hype
6721419 were people who really just like to get out and ride its a lot less about showing off
6721420 a lot of harley riders are into making noise and being seen i couldnt care less about either of those things
6721421 the harley scene has become so washed out and overblown
6721422 it used to be guys with way too much facial hair and real leather and they rode with meaning behind it now its less about individuality
6721423 some callers are shocked when we tell them we dont service harleys others ask how we stay in business
6721424 the 105th is great for milwaukee for harley davidson and for the economy

6721427 we definitely want to raise awareness that with every dollar spent you make a choice about whom and what you are supporting

6721433 this is the most varied and highest quality collection of cars weve had in our four years
6721434 we love the wonderful highly detailed restorations but when you get a high quality car that is still in its original condition thats real history there it doesnt get any better
6721435 we are very pleased with the courts thorough and well reasoned opinion rejecting defendant ahmeds motion to suppress the highly incriminating statements he made to the fbi
6721436 you know i feel like we let usa softball down
6721437 many women have worn this uniform and accepted nothing but gold so many thoughts what more could i have done and then can this be the last time that softball players stand on the podium at the olympic games the unknown future of our sport all those young girls watching us and all the many people whove supported me i havent seen my son in a month and a half i cant wait to see his little face when i get home so many things
6721438 whatever i said last year i said everything under emotions
6721439 i feel great i just won a damn gold medal
6721440 i really kind of feel that maybe people will get off our back and realize that there is some parity in this game
6721441 i think we missed a big opportunity to support womens sport
6721442 we were getting the best athletes in the sport unlike baseball were getting athletes that are subject to a very good anti doping program unlike baseball and were trying to create a balance on the program between men and women so i think unfortunately softball got caught up in the shotgun blast against baseball
6721443 you know you dont have to be six four finch is 6 ft 1 in you dont have to be 200 pounds we have all different shapes and sizes the sport tests so many athletic abilities from hand eye coordination to speed to agility to quickness were finally at the pinnacle weve finally been established please dont take this away
6721444 weve fought it weve fought it weve fought it for so long
6721445 but on the drive up knowing this could be it you cant fight it anymore
6721446 as a pitcher i think we all want the ball in our hands
6721447 i hold that responsibility being an olympic softball player what more can i do lisa fernandez dot richardson the many greats theyve done so much and now its our turn and what did we do with the torch so yeah you do feel let down those many girls they dont look to the international olympic committee they look to us
6721448 this is to protect poor muslims from rich christians who buy their organs and vice versa
6721449 we all have the same egyptian blood but if the reason for the measure is to end organ trafficking we rejected it because it may also occur between believers of the same religion
6721450 we are afraid that in the future there will be hospitals for christians and hospitals for muslims
6721451 it is not about trying to promote differences between religions but its just to minimize the trade of organs as much as we can
6721452 if the medical association does not annull the measure there will be more conflict between muslims and christians

6721454 thousands of ex homosexuals have experienced the life changing love of jesus christ
6721455 police cannot threaten to arrest christians at a city park for sharing their viewpoint at an event open to the general public respecting their free speech rights is not optional
6721456 arresting them forcibly removing them or otherwise restricting their speech in traditional public fora due to the content and viewpoint of such speech or because of their religious beliefs
6721457 threatening to arrest christians simply because they have opposing views and choose to exercise their free speech rights at a public place is unconstitutional
6721458 the marketing of evil how radicals elitists and pseudo experts sell us corruption disguised as freedom
6721459 speech cannot be prohibited in the absence of a tenable threat of disruption furthermore the policys use of hostile offensive and gender motivated is on its face sufficiently broad and subjective that they could conceivably be applied to cover any speech of a gender motivated nature the content of which offends someone
6721460 this could include core political and religious speech such as gender politics and sexual morality the policy provides no shelter for core protected speech
6721461 the sherman tank in world war ii for want of a gun
6721462 it had nothing to do with his first amendment rights and everything to do with temple professors academic freedom to grade a students poorly written poorly constructed thesis
6721463 the marketing of evil how radicals elitists and pseudo experts sell us corruption disguised as freedom
6721464 for me the important thing wasnt about rights or the benefits
6721465 i just wanted the tribe to say yes we recognize that you are just as important as any other tribe member and we will treat you and your spouse as we treat all tribal members
6721466 it can do anything good or anything bad to the tribes and the indian people as citizen indians
6721467 for our tribe we want people to walk in the shoes of other people and learn to respect differences
6721468 the senate passed it in a voice vote to avoid going on record when the legislature heard we were planning a referendum petition they passed it again adding special emergency act language to make it go into effect immediately instead of the usual 90 days
6721469 they forced gay marriage on us through a radical judiciary and corrupt politicians they think were beaten well were not conversely if we dont fight back now they have the green light to do anything they want in the future
6721470 secondly it shows the legislature that we can do this in the future if we have to were not afraid to stand up to them
6721471 and also it shows the rest of the country that were not going to allow the homosexual lobby to rule us
6721472 the marketing of evil how radicals elitists and pseudo experts sell us corruption disguised as freedom

6721474 we have to start stringing together some wins we cant just keep winning one here losing one there weve got to get on a streak here hopefully that can start friday night
6721475 we have to do better if we want to play in october
6721476 we made things happen we had that winning attitude right now it feels like we have to be a little perfect we have to do everything right to catch a break and get a win
6721477 hes not the best pitcher in the game for nothing
6721478 hes not going to leave the ball in the middle of the plate hes not going to throw too many straight pitches hes so good hed be the ace on any team in the big leagues
6721479 my sinker wasnt there my slider wasnt there my change up wasnt there i pitched like crap and i let these guys down today

6721491 i have no problem with him doing a show i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters

6721496 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6721497 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6721498 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6721499 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6721500 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6721501 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6721502 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6721503 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6721504 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6721505 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6721506 if you trust every web site but not a government
6721507 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6721508 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6721509 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6721510 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6721511 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes

6721753 it doesnt matter if it is the olympics the world championships or the european championships the feeling is the same i see no difference between my competitors whether they come from the united states or new zealand
6721754 i was just trying to take the gate and come out first i just raced my race and it came out for the best
6721755 im still young i have plans for the future and i have a lot more to accomplish
6721756 this olympic gold is only one step in my career

6721941 its clear the findings have some wider implications for anzs management of other non traditional businesses particularly in our institutional division

6721943 i recognise the legacy of anzs involvement in equity finance may well be with the group for some time through legal claims that we will continue to defend and the impact of these issues to our reputation

6722021 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6722022 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6722023 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6722024 everyone can rest assured that the festival will be fantastic and everything has been put in place to make sure it goes well
6722025 the weather has been terrible recently and left the ground wet and muddy but plastic tracks have been put down all over the site so people can walk on those rather than on the mud to deal with the problem
6722026 there is around 25 000 worth of walkways put down which is a great idea by the organisers what we really need is a full dry day to let the ground dry out in time for the festival and i would recommend everybody takes their wellies but the preparations have all gone really well

6722035 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
6722036 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
6722037 because extractions of wisdom teeth are commonly operated in dental clinics we can expect a lot of donors of stem cells
6722038 that enable us to create stem cells of various genetic codes eliminating the risk that a body of a patient would reject transplanted tissues or organs

6722100 una tensione a livello internazionale tra le iniziative volte a promuovere la riduzione della povert e quelle che promuovono la democrazia pluripartitica competitiva
6722101 in molti casi le democrazie producono governi molto efficaci nel ridurre la povert basta vedere la recente esperienza del brasile per esempio
6722102 esistono anche regimi meno democratici che sono stati e sono tuttora molto efficaci nel ridurre la povert e la comunit internazionale deve riconoscere che parte di questa efficacia pu essere dovuta anche alla natura del regime laddove una forte connessione tra il regime e i cittadini stata creata da un movimento popolare che genera un
6722103 cina e vietnam sono due possibili esempi e negli ultimi sessantanni ce ne sono stati altri questo implica che la comunit internazionale dovrebbe muoversi con prudenza quando si aggiungono condizioni politiche agli aiuti o ad altri negoziati internazionali ovviamente questo non significa che in casi estremi come lo zimbabwe la comunit internazionale non debba assumere una forte posizione politica

6722114 is the mca agreeable to this what about gerakan there has been talk that they wanted to leave bn arent these signs that efforts to create national integrity have failed
6722115 if we do not incite the rakyat by provoking them and together we honestly and fairly tackle the problems that the country and people are facing i think we would be able to enjoy a more comfortable situation

6722141 the crickets were chirping and i think i could hear a crow in background so they ushered us up the red carpet and on to a podium to have our picture taken
6722142 then a security guard came up to me and the other female cast member and said can we get the girlfriends out of the shot we were like were actually in the show but thank you for validating our presence and our sense of equality in the comedy industry

6722146 i thought the way i grew up was normal until i started comparing myself to other people
6722147 instead of giving us umbrellas for example mum would cut arm holes in a garbage bag we were only allowed to watch half an hour of tv a day until i reached the age of 10 i had to be in bed by 6pm when it was daylight savings the f ing sun would still be shining
6722148 if that was true my job would be done the jokes would write themselves id just sit back and put my hand out for the cash
6722149 i was out at the time and when i came home my mum said you know your usb drive what was on it i said everything why the telegraph quoted him as saying
6722150 she hadn t actually digested it just chewed it to bits it was up on my windowsill in my bedroom so i don t know how she got hold of it
6722151 i was severely annoyed to say the least i thought about finding a good taxidermist to get her stuffed but it s hard to stay mad at those puppy dog eyes for long
6722152 when i told the teachers the dog had eaten my homework they rolled their eyes at me and said it wasn t a valid excuse and they wouldn t give me an extension
6722153 i m staying upbeat and thinking that in the circumstances i am just delighted that i passed i had already forgiven ruby so i m not going down that road of being angry at her again i know she didn t do it on purpose

6722156 we continue to expect a technical recession in the second half of the year and the mpc to respond with the first in a series of rate cuts in november we judge that the risks of an earlier move have risen
6722157 high energy prices have led to an increase in biodiesel production which in turn has led to an increase in the amount of crude glycerol in the market
6722158 we have shown that it is possible to use the crude glycerol byproduct from the biodiesel industry as a carbon source for microalgae that produce omega 3 fatty acids after thorough chemical analysis we have also shown that the algae biomass composition has the same quality as the commercial algae product
6722159 the results so far have been promising the fish fed the algae had significant amounts of omega 3 fatty acids
6722160 we are replacing our static per keyword quality scores with a system that will evaluate an ads quality each time it matches a search query this way adwords will use the most accurate specific and up to date performance information when determining whether an ad should be displayed

6722167 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
6722168 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
6722169 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
6722170 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
6722171 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
6722172 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
6722173 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
6722174 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production
6722175 ill attempt to start hitting some balls for the first time and see if my wrist is strong enough and up to it yet

6722190 few people take objectives really seriously they put average effort into too many things rather than superior thought and effort into a few important things people who achieve the most are selective as well as determined
6722191 they say that nobody is perfect then they tell you that practice makes perfect i wish theyd make up their minds
6722192 a complete and accurately defined list of projects kept current and reviewed on at least a weekly basis is a master key to stress free productivity
6722193 aim for success not perfection never give up your right to be wrong because then you will lose the ability to learn new things and move forward with your life remember that fear always lurks behind perfectionism confronting your fears and allowing yourself the right to be human can paradoxically make yourself a happier and more productive person
6722194 once again i have had to pay for equipment hire printing consumable supplies etc once again i wont get that money back please write phone email your mp ask how can the police be allowed to do this they havent gone through the courts or the licensing authorities they havent produced any evidence to back up their position we have never called the police to any of our events to deal with any violent behaviour ever
6722195 we have worked closely with the event organiser and the showground committee over the last few months in preparing for this event
6722196 up until very recently we were satisfied that appropriate control measures could be put in place to mitigate the threat this position has now changed
6722197 it is about the fact that not just the people of springfield but so many millions of viewers of the simpsons are so resistant to change and the introduction of something really unique and entirely plausible that something deep down inside them is offended
6722198 fanboys hate things that are shit and i hate fanboys therefore i demand that tv be shittier
6722199 people on the internet are dumb nerds and we should ignore them
6722200 we already have a number of cars signed up but we want to raise as much money as we can for the charities we are supporting this year winstons wish the richard burns foundation and click sergeant which cares for young people with cancer any car is eligible but as this year is the 60th anniversary of the xk we would like to see as many jaguars as possible taking part

6722205 our office has been involved in the investigation of thousands of pounds of mislabeled imported fish
6722206 i thought sushi stores that we go to would be 100 percent correct
6722207 because eighty percent of the seafood that we eat in this country is imported its hard to tell
6722208 probably somewhere in the distribution and processing we dont want to accuse any establishment without knowing whether they were aware of it or not

6722213 the basic idea is that people should not be forced to say or to do things they believe are morally wrong in particular health care professionals should not be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
6722214 freedom of expression and action are unfit barter for admission to medical employment or training
6722215 by leaving the term abortion undefined the regulations create all sort of space for ideology and political views to insinuate themselves into medical practices emergency rooms and clinics all across the country and when that happens women will suffer
6722216 in a field where were already losing a disproportionate number of doctors this would enable them not only to stay but also maybe to recruit more doctors who are highly qualified and can provide quality care to their patients
6722217 he went out with police officers around darlington and pointed out addresses that he had burgled over the last two years which had not been detected

6722226 as we feared the beijing olympic games have been a period conducive to arrests convictions censorship surveillance and harassment of more than 100 journalists bloggers and dissidents
6722227 this repression will be remembered as one of the defining characteristics of the beijing games
6722228 we also call for respect for free expression to become one of the criteria when selecting cities to host the games
6722229 we hail all those in china and abroad who did not stop pressing for more freedom of expression before the olympic games
6722230 we will remain vigilant in case the post olympic period ushers in a new wave of repression
6722231 they dont stop following me filming me and photographing me
6722232 i think twice before interviewing chinese about sensitive issues for fear that they could be arrested
6722233 i hope that the 2008 games will be over as quickly as possible as this event has brought us too much suffering

6722243 in februari 2007 heeft belgacom besloten om in het kader van de reorganisatie van de belgacom group een nieuwe structuur uit te tekenen voor de topkaderleden
6722244 op dat ogenblik zijn alle nieuwe functies en de personen die deze functies zouden uitvoeren bepaald en voorgesteld aan het belgacom directiecomit deze nieuwe structuur is unaniem goedgekeurd door het directiecomit
6722245 nooit een discussie of een negatief advies geweest over enige functie zo ook niet over de benoeming van mevrouw fagard in dit hele proces zijn alle interne policies gerespecteerd en is er niets tegenstrijdig gebeurd
6722246 de functies van de topkaderleden gelden al sinds 1 maart 2007 en werden nooit eerder in vraag gesteld
6722247 ze hebben het dier met een boot meegesleept terwijl het duidelijk nog kon bewegen dit doet denken aan japanse walvisjagers het is werkelijk afschuwelijk

6722271 starting 6 september we will be coming out with a three part special feature on a business channel this is not what you call a sponsored program or a part of a campaign its a new concept we also plan to come out with a television campaign later
6722272 die luft ist so frisch hier sie duftet nach salz und jod einfach herrlich
6722273 na simon nun bist du das erste mal am meer
6722274 aufregend oder h r zu ich muss erst einmal ein schiff f r die passage nach london und eine unterkunft besorgen vielleicht ist ja noch etwas bei den van den booms in der kapucijnenstraat frei dort habe ich schon mehrmals bernachtet dann k nnen wir morgen noch einen kunden hier in oostende besuchen und bermorgen fr h geht es dann nach london
6722275 wenn du dem kai in diese richtung folgst kommst du an den strand ans offene meer wenn du willst treffen wir uns dort in einer halben bis dreiviertelstunde
6722276 papa schau dir nur die schiffe an sie wiegen sich in der see
6722277 ja der wellengang wird noch zunehmen am pier hat man mir erz hlt dass sie hier mit ziemlich rauer see rechnen und daher ab bermorgen vielleicht keine schiffe mehr ber den kanal setzen wir segeln also schon morgen fr h
6722278 sie da gn dige frau rechts herum die passagierkabinen sind hinten auf dem schiff
6722279 warum haben die denn hier ein brett vor dem bett
6722280 damit wir bei seegang nicht aus dem bett fallen sollte dir unwohl werden gehst du am besten an die frische luft
6722281 das kann sich schnell ndern wenn wir auf see sind wenn du dich bergeben musst dann am besten ber die reling aber nicht gegen die windrichtung hast du mich verstanden und wenn du andere leute an bord siehst denen es nicht gut geht bei dir auf die lippen und lach sie nicht aus
6722282 wenn du an bord heruml ufst pass bitte auf dich auf das deck kann rutschig sein am besten du hast eine hand immer an einem festen punkt
6722283 damals ist das unwetter sehr pl tzlich aufgekommen wir hatten gerade etwas mehr als die h lfte der strecke auf dem rmelkanal zur ckgelegt da wurde das schiff derma en von den wellen hin und hergeworfen das viele der passagiere angst um ihr leben hatten
6722284 ein postschiff mehr kann ich dir nicht dazu erz hlen
6722285 ich hei e simon braun ich bin mit meinem vater unterwegs
6722286 aha mein name ist george thomson und ich bin der kapit n hier
6722287 der kapit n dann k nnen sie mir bestimmt erkl ren auf was f r einem schiff wir hier sind mein vater wusste das n mlich nicht
6722288 ja wir kommen aus mainz am rhein und haben eine weinkellerei zu hause
6722289 mit wein kenne ich mich nicht besonders aus aber wenn du sp ter mal ein sehr gutes bier trinken willst dann erinnere dich an smithwicks ale das stammt aus einer brauerei in kilkenny in irland du sprichst brigens sehr gut englisch
6722290 oh da besucht ihr bestimmt eure verwandten jetzt aber zu deiner frage das schiff ist auf den name the repatriate getauft was so viel bedeutet wie der wiederkehrende es hei t so weil es immer auf der gleichen strecke zwischen london und oostende hin und her f hrt vom typ her ist es eine brigg sie hat zwei masten mit rahsegeln und ein briggsegel am hinteren gro mast du sieht dort oben die rahsegel sind quer zum schiff aufgeh ngt das briggsegel l uft mit dem schiffsbug und wird zwischen der gaffel oben und dem baum hochgezogen
6722291 schau dir das treiben erst mal von unten an dann k nnen wir sp ter immer noch sehen
6722292 brigg den namen habe ich schon einmal geh rt jetzt sind wir brigens auf dem rmelkanal simon wie geht es dir
6722293 ich frage nur dem einen oder anderen passagier auf dem achterdeck ist schon jetzt die farbe aus dem gesicht gefallen
6722294 papa ich bin gleich wieder zur ck ich m chte mal nach vorne gehen
6722295 wie lange werden wir wohl bei diesem wetter bis london ben tigen
6722296 bei durchschnittlichem westwind von oostende nach southend on sea in der themsem ndung etwa zw lf stunden und dann noch einmal sechs stunden bis in die london docks bei diesem s dwestwind sch tze ich neun stunden bis southend on sea dann aber ungef hr eine stunde l nger auf der themse also sieben stunden
6722297 hey gut gemacht junge stell dich jetzt auf die andere seite von frank damit ich auch an ihn herankomme dann ziehen wir ihn gemeinsam hoch
6722298 braun sie haben einen ja einen sohn keine spur von angst klettert wie ein alter in der takelage herum
6722299 zum kapit n joseph ihr sollt euch unverz glich beim kapit n melden
6722300 meine damen und herren ich bin sehr erleichtert dass matrose frank wieder gesund auf dem deck steht das h tte t dlich enden k nnen als kapit n dieses schiffes m chte ich mich bei den beiden rettern herzlich bedanken erstaunt bin ich vor allem ber das verhalten unseres jungen passagiers simon braun in ihren augen kann ich sehen dass sie das alle genauso empfinden bevor auch nur einer von uns einen gedanken fassen konnte hat simon schon die m glichkeiten f r franks rettung erfasst war flink wie ein wiesel in der takelage der repatriate unterwegs und zeigte uns seinen b renmut
6722301 herr braun ihr sohn gef llt mir der wird sp ter seinen weg gehen
6722302 10 e i olan adam ya lan nca kalpten l r benim g c m allahtan geliyor 86 e imle ba a kabiliyorum
6722303 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6722304 the eternal god is your refuge and underneath are the everlasting arms
6722305 for sure last year kimi was 17 points behind with two races to go and he won the championship so we cannot give up he told

6722307 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6722308 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6722309 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
6722310 weve all got a kind of love hate relationship with the university of washington
6722311 affects the health safety or security of any member of the university community or the mission of the university
6722312 we have a responsibility to educate our students about being responsible citizens
6722313 led the university to start taking a more proactive approach to curbing off campus behavior
6722314 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6722315 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6722316 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6722317 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers
6722318 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
6722319 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack
6722320 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6722321 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6722322 a couple of years ago i was able to buy everything practically new
6722323 you just have to do some things different to adjust
6722324 weve seen an increase in terms of clothes school supplies broken in sports gear its a great way to get brand name styles for cheaper
6722325 its not just the working poor were also seeing more middle class families coming to us
6722326 parents would go naked before they would send their kids to school without the right tools to be able to get an education
6722327 you dont want a child to feel embarrassed or left out
6722328 thats not a good way to start the school year
6722329 gas alone is making me rethink a whole lot of things it looks like well have to do fewer projects or just come up with another creative way to do them
6722330 she said she cant have a regular calculator it has to have different functions on it
6722331 you make sure that the teacher understands whats going on so they dont penalize them
6722332 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6722333 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6722334 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6722335 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6722336 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6722337 choosing to shoot the film in new york was a risky decision as the drama industry works very differently in the us from the uk
6722338 but the huge amount of strategic planning and the leap of faith are delivering a first rate calibre of cast
6722339 and weve been touched by the number of friends and admirers of his who have wanted to help with the project in myriad different ways
6722340 we are delighted to be making another film about quentin crisp given the naked civil servant was such a landmark film for itv
6722341 its a real thrill and honour to be bringing an actor of john hurts stature back to the channel to reprise such an iconic role
6722342 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6722343 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6722344 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6722345 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6722346 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6722347 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6722348 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6722349 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6722350 as a precaution for some discomfort he was feeling due to heartburn and gastroenteritis
6722351 it was definitely was not a heart attack he is fine and healthy and enjoying the rest of his vacation travelling in the caribbean
6722352 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6722353 pretty much from here on out its just so close were trying to win every game for the team if i clean up on decisions great but im just trying to go out and get deep into the game give us a chance to win
6722354 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
6722355 ive been able to get down in the zone low and get a lot of ground balls and strikeouts
6722356 he gets more people to chase pitches down in the zone so you just have to be really patient and really selective at what you swing at
6722357 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6722358 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6722359 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6722360 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6722361 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6722362 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6722363 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6722364 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6722365 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6722366 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6722367 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6722368 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6722369 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6722370 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6722371 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6722372 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6722373 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6722374 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6722375 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6722376 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6722377 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6722378 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6722379 ahora hay una negociaci n abierta para tratar de convencer a estos ltimos de que abandonen el pesquero de momento no s nada m s
6722380 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6722381 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6722382 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6722383 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6722384 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6722385 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6722386 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6722387 who are open to doing something on the production side
6722388 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6722389 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6722390 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6722391 las piedras lo dir n a n no me han dicho basta

6722395 guinness book of world records most downloaded podcast of all time
6722396 we had a good test at brno and now i go to my second home race after a podium and after finding some really positive things in the test that will help us for the rest of the season and in the future
6722397 it was great for me to get a podium but i know we can start pushing for more and that must be the next step everybody is working hard and now that i am back to full fitness i can push as hard as possible to try to make it happen
6722398 i really like the misano circuit and know that i can go well there as i showed last year with a second place
6722399 we found quite a few things at brno both during the race weekend and certainly during the test
6722400 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6722401 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6722402 they have done a fantastic job here brilliant facilities and a great atmosphere and i have learned a huge amount but i am more confident than ever about what we can do in greenwich
6722403 i am hugely excited to have got the job my first priority will be to work with the venue design team as our sport is unique in having four legged athletes as well as two legged ones training on site some venues will just be used for two or three days with athletes training elsewhere but at greenwich the venue is the sport and the sport is the venue
6722404 sue benson was here and is pleased that in greenwich her course will be able to be more open less twisty and longer a 10 or 11 minute course rather than the 8 minute one that for obvious reasons they had here
6722405 i am very confident about the site at greenwich i can understand that some people are concerned because decisions have not yet been made so they havent been communicated we need to get down to details so that people can be informed and i would expect that to be done by next spring
6722406 no decisions on the final number of spectators have been made yet

6722411 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

6722413 it is ultimately the home offices responsibility to maintain the security of this material
6722414 the government will no doubt seek to blame private contractors but the rash of data losses over the last two years confirm that there is something much more worrying at stake this government cannot keep any information safe
6722415 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6722416 if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies and ask them to do research for you then you have to be absolutely certain that the company concerned has put in practice procedures which will be just as robust as the procedures that i hope the government has followed
6722417 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
6722418 every time we come to a track im not sure where we are because its just so tight around the top ten
6722419 we just have to wait and see how it goes it would be great for us to keep our momentum up
6722420 at hockenheim too we had good pace although the result didnt show it but budapest showed that we made another step and hopefully we can repeat it here
6722421 the problem is the result doesnt always show that we progressed from race to race
6722422 obviously if its a normal race its going to be impossible to score points
6722423 but if we have a good strategy and are a bit lucky then we can do well you never know its important to get to the end of the race and score the best result we can
6722424 im confident about the seamless shift we have made another development in terms of reliability but although its two or three tenths better its not enough
6722425 its a street circuit but its not really a difficult one
6722426 its quite wide like australia really and its difficult to learn but i dont think that its a possibility to be much quicker than other people
6722427 with more than a quarter of the u s gross national product over 2 trillion sensitive to weather and climate events these events substantially impact our national health safety economy environment transportation systems and military readiness
6722428 all 50 states are impacted by these events and many of these events will be exacerbated by climate change
6722429 our concern is that our nation is not prepared for severe weather or climate change because of declining budgets and lack of attention to these threats over the past few years
6722430 we should improve our ability to respond to severe weather events and prepare for the impacts of climate change that will undoubtedly occur over the next several decades decision makers need information on how climate change will affect their local areas but we are hampered by a lack of funding observations and computing power to provide information at this local level
6722431 making our nation resilient to severe weather and climate change
6722432 given the costs of weather and climate disasters we believe these are wise and critical investments
6722433 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6722434 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6722435 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6722436 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6722437 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6722438 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6722439 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6722440 we have known for some time that young and middle aged adults who are overweight run a higher risk of death and it was presumed that this held true for older people in fact our results show that the risk of dying is higher only for the most severely obese but that all older people who are overweight are at significantly increased risk of developing problems with mobility and carrying out everyday tasks
6722441 this research is important because a growing proportion of the population is aged 65 or over and more and more of these older people are overweight in fact in most developed countries middle aged and elderly adults are more likely to be obese than people in any other age group these findings have huge significance for the delivery of health care both now and in the future increasing numbers of older people and higher levels of overweight and obesity will lead to a greater burden of disability and ill health and place an immense strain on health and social services the issue is likely to get worse as time goes on and represents a ticking time bomb for health services around the world
6722442 staying a healthy weight can be a fun and relatively easy thing to do even as people get older
6722443 our experience of running supported walking and cycling groups has shown that older people benefit in many ways from regular physical activity
6722444 people are living longer but this study shows that excess weight can have a real impact on the quality of peoples lives which can reduce the benefit of those extra years we must do all we can to encourage older friends or relatives to build enjoyable exercise into their daily routine and develop good habits ourselves to take into our retirement years people can visit http www strollbacktheyears info or http www healthpromcornwall org for more advice
6722445 this report highlights the problem of obesity in an increasingly ageing population
6722446 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6722447 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6722448 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6722449 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6722450 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6722451 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6722452 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6722453 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6722454 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6722455 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6722456 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6722457 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6722458 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6722459 ke 13 perusahaan itu telah selesai mendirikan pabriknya di subang jawa barat dan sudah mulai berproduksi
6722460 namun pabrik yang sudah beroperasi masih mengeluhkan kendala pasokan energi listrik yang sangat minim
6722461 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6722462 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6722463 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6722464 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6722465 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6722466 this should be a very simple process once it is started and i believe that les is going to probably work with the department on trying to fast track it
6722467 you guys remember where spokane is right on the eastern side of washington state
6722468 i did not have parents who were involved in my success and moving around a great deal i never had a teacher who took interest in my learning
6722469 this is part of the reason i want to help kids who may have been in the same spot i was
6722470 the primary focus is the safety of the detainees as well as the detainee guard force and thats why we have this intelligence activity
6722471 guantanamo has become little more than a holding center for hundreds of men most of whom will never be charged with a crime and have nothing to offer the u s government in the way of actionable intelligence
6722472 you always want to make sure you understand the mood of the camp
6722473 if i see a change in behavior my question then will be well is this because of a new procedure ive implemented or is this just because its hot outside or ive got a new rotation of detainee guards
6722474 this is a historic agreement that will help us to recruit and retain experienced rns to our hospitals
6722475 meal and break relief rns will mean our patients will be taken care of safely and within the requirement of existing state law and nurses will finally be able to take needed rest and meal breaks
6722476 this settlement is a demonstration of the unity and commitment of sutter rns throughout northern california to win provisions in our contracts that will enhance our ability to provide safe quality care to our patients and our communities
6722477 rns will also get assistance with patient handling from trained personnel which will help both patients and nurses
6722478 california pacific medical center st lukes hospital appears to be going in the opposite direction with their most recent regressive proposal on healthcare
6722479 the last bargaining session we had with them was on july 31st we were hopeful that given the positive outcome of the blue ribbon panel findings to maintain st lukes as a full service acute care hospital and management stating they looked forward to a new relationship that the bargaining session would be more positive instead they put forward a proposal which does not provide rns healthcare security but rather allows management to make unilateral changes at any time this is on the heels of an arbitration ruling against sutter for raising co payments and drug costs mid contract and requiring that cpmc must repay the rns and cpmc continues to refuse to comply
6722480 for me his achievement is as valid as phelps or bolt
6722481 i dont like to compare athletes from different sports but ben ainslie competes in a boat class where he can only win one medal
6722482 the others phelps and bolt can win two three all the way up to eight what they do is fantastic but what ainslie does is equally fantastic
6722483 the performance of the british team has not surprised me because i know what they have put in place
6722484 since a few years ago especially after the 1996 atlanta games where it was not so spectacular you have made a very good effort
6722485 you have targeted some sports where you could win more medals which was very wise you have a population of 60 million you cannot compete with mammoths like the us and china
6722486 and you had a lot of lottery funding which has been criticised but the results are there and i think it was worthwhile
6722487 we had a very good example with greece in 2004
6722488 it was a return to the roots to the country that invented the olympics london should be the return to the country which invented modern sport there is fantastic tradition but also the way of life the way you approach and play sport
6722489 and this is going to last for evident reasons the demography is never going to work against china their system allows unlimited resources in terms of people and finance for sport and they are very clever in importing a lot of very knowledgeable foreign trainers
6722490 in the short and mid term the united states will still be dominant in terms of economic power and sport
6722491 they still have the most number of sponsors the revenue generated by sport is mainly us based so that will last for a time but it is not the hegemony we had a few years ago
6722492 the tests we have conducted have been negative and i am very glad about that but time will tell if this is something that will last for the future
6722493 i said we could have 30 or 40 positive tests but if we dont reach that number it will prove the deterrent part of our strategy is working
6722494 initial operations of the area would be overseen and operated by this independent association or commission whose board of directors would be appointed by the mayor approved by the assembly and who would be responsible for all daily operations and recommendations for capital improvements
6722495 were trying to get the nerve tissue to integrate with a device to grow into it to form a better connection
6722496 to get long term release we think these multi component systems are the way to go
6722497 we can control the release by combining the materials in different ways and were confident that we can extend the release time further even to 90 days
6722498 the new recommendation from the smc is to be welcomed new data supporting the role of versatis in post herpetic neuralgia will further establish that such a novel non systemic treatment approach offers significant benefits in the older patient group who suffer co morbidities and consequential polypharmacy
6722499 the smc is to be congratulated on its revised decision for versatis theyve taken a huge step forward in extending options for pain relief for people living with neuropathic pain this decision will alleviate a lot of suffering
6722500 not only do multiple heart events increase healthcare costs due to additional hospitalizations tests and physician visits but they also result in higher morbidity for many patients
6722501 use of nicotine replacement therapy nrt during pregnancy is controversial because nrt contains one of the toxins in tobacco smoke and not much is known about the safety of nrt use during pregnancy
6722502 our study suggests that nrt assisted smoking cessation or smoking reduction in early pregnancy provides some protection from stillbirth among women who continue to smoke during pregnancy more research on a range of smoking associated health outcomes is needed if we are to understand the overall safety of nrt use in pregnancy
6722503 most women tend to be sensible when they are pregnant and work hard at adopting healthier lifestyles
6722504 giving up on tobacco can be difficult as it is addictive but there are ways to manage the cravings during this period a slow weaning off from tobacco and a combination of nrt and behavioural therapy is advised
6722505 the best result from this is the birth of a healthy baby however the long term aim for the mother should be to stop smoking
6722506 het is altijd belangrijk om iets unieks te hebben voor ieder groot evenement
6722507 en deze games convention is in mate van belangrijkheid echt aan het toenemen niet alleen voor europa maar voor de hele industrie de e3 was in het verleden de grote show waar veel uitgevers waaronder wijzelf zich alleen maar op leken te richten
6722508 veel wintersporters die aan het einde van de middag de piste verlaten om ergens wat te drinken kijken nauwelijks meer om naar hun materiaal
6722509 voor zon apr s skigelegenheid staan dan zeker honderd skis en snowboards terwijl de eigenaren binnen in de kroeg staan te feesten wordt buiten hun materiaal weggenomen
6722510 vorig jaar zijn er alleen in onze regio meer dan duizend skis en snowboards gestolen dit seizoen is weer slecht begonnen
6722511 het zou leuk zijn om ook eens wat geld te verdienen met internet
6722512 one of the key skin treatments in looking after eczema and ichthyosis is to use emollients as often as possible they are the foundation on which all additional treatment is based however the most important consideration is whether the patient finds the emollient recommended by their physician acceptable to use the most greasy that is tolerated should be used and this may vary during the day so that a lighter cream may be more appropriate for daytime use and a greasier one at night sticky messy or difficult to apply emollients will simply not be used as often as they should be so the patients skin condition can easily get out of control
6722513 ichthyosis varies enormously across and within the different types it is therefore very important for sufferers to have a choice of emollients which are appropriate to the severity of their condition
6722514 the combination of glycerol which improves the stratum corneum elasticity and white soft paraffin and liquid paraffin in dexeryl offers a highly acceptable non sticky and non greasy formulation which patients in our trials significantly prefer
6722515 people are very much encouraged by the new face of the campaign because they were not happy with the original theory of im not going to be aggressive im not going to attack
6722516 everybody felt that if he did that he would have a tough time winning
6722517 the presumption that i am blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save my country in its hour of need
6722518 they went ahead and laid the foundation under rick and it was time to whack somebody under steve
6722519 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
6722520 once he joined the club the advertising changed and immediately they got with drawing the distinctions
6722521 i know schmidts got a rule that you do positive and negative at the same time but i havent seen much of the positive
6722522 just by mccain being mccain and giving the answers he does hell reassure a lot of people
6722523 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6722524 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6722525 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6722526 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6722527 young people should be presented with two options you either earn or learn welfare payments should not be an option for people under 21
6722528 you can get more on cdep than working for comalco rio tinto aluminium
6722529 the government is very committed to ensuring we provide every bit of support we can for indigenous jobseekers in order to close the gap between indigenous and non indigenous people that are in work but we will not treat australians differently
6722530 han sido mucho los momentos duros y dif ciles que se han llegado a vivir como el caso de una persona que ha perdido a cuatro miembros de su familia uno de ellos un bebe de tres meses
6722531 que ha hecho mucho a lo largo de su vida por el mundo cooperativo
6722532 hoy es un d a nada agradable para el sector ya que se ha perdido a un buen cooperativista
6722533 well what would i want and expect it to do
6722534 since the prisoner khodorkovsky had no connection with the professional educational program offered him in detention he does not deserve conditional early release
6722535 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6722536 just about nothing as the first mission of any effort to take them over would be to keep those markets operating as they are
6722537 conseguimos ver um dos navios perto do litoral mas n o sabemos qual

6722547 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6722548 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6722549 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6722550 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28
6722551 jim nantz is asleep in the cbs truck cause golf without tiger really does suck
6722552 weve asked him to do videos with us and stuff which hes also agreed to do he was very nice about it and then we blew it somehow
6722553 he heard we did way too much drugs and never slept
6722554 which isnt true so he didnt want to do it
6722555 being able to work with tegan has been tops on our list
6722556 i have researched it and am not going to make excuses but the fact is that mediafire has made several upgrades recently when i was taking a break from blogging
6722557 in all seriousness i am the one who f ed up by not realizing that without creating an account mediafire has been archiving my uploads for my convenience via my browser cache and that as part of their new convenient features they offer automatic folder sharing which must be turned off i dont blame anyone for and am not accusing anyone of stealing things
6722558 please keep in mind that these records are made possible by our record labels
6722559 if you downloaded it in advance through the leak and you can afford it i urge you to support those labels and us by downloading it legally
6722560 well i couldnt resist throwing this out there but feel free to take it away
6722561 hey ive come up with something that nobody else has done
6722562 no no i cant go out mom says i have to work on my song
6722563 im not leaving the dead kennedys so much as right now i cant perform with the dead kennedys for the foreseeable future
6722564 and its nothing to do with personal stuff or anything like that
6722565 sometimes i can look like homer simpson sometimes i can look like john mccain
6722566 its really neat if only i could make it happen at will
6722567 hes a little bit of a latino guy you know
6722568 its a beautiful place we live a peaceful lifestyle here but theres also a real dark underbelly to it its reflected in the name in the music in the message and we felt like we really hit home this time
6722569 for one music has moved into a day and age when people are going to quit listening on cd players so therefore the cd is an obsolete product if you will
6722570 to put out a cd and manufacture all that product to put out there when people arent really buying that medium anymore
6722571 in 28 years ive never had a desire to drive what kind of loser wants a car right now
6722572 and started writing songs that i cared about i just needed to find myself in some kind of way somehow it turned into a full fledged project
6722573 ben folds was the primary songwriter for that other band so i think thats the big difference this sound of hotel lights is something ive been doing since about 2000 just kind of refining it and working on it
6722574 basically it was something fun for me to do to step outside from my usual routine with hotel lights
6722575 trying to write for characters in a musical but then i would hear the song and i thought i can actually pull this off too so that how it kind of ended up on the album
6722576 some of our hardcore fans had been excited about that song for a while
6722577 i always liked the song and i always wanted to do something with it it seemed enough time had gone by and i always wanted to record a version on my own
6722578 i dont think i knew what i was getting into
6722579 i just wanted to sit around with my headphones and write songs on my 4 track its been a really fun transition and enough years have gone by now that i have a great band

6722581 there are some quite big question marks around whether this scheme offers good value to sponsors and whether it is going to be able to raise the 79m
6722582 however well intentioned it is medal hopes is already causing a lot of confusion
6722583 the staging of the games is very heavily dependent on sponsorship and london 2012 are further ahead than any other city has ever been at this stage in raising sponsorship from major private companies to support the staging of the games
6722584 ive had the opportunity to meet with a lot of british businesses in the three weeks ive been in beijing and i am confident that this is a soundly based ambition that we can raise this money
6722585 we have announced our intention to do so lets come back in 18 months time and review progress
6722586 i knew frankly that there would be probably more than 13 14 15 medals youve won 17 gold medals to now
6722587 it doesnt surprise me because i know what youve put in place youve put a very good effort
6722588 you have targeted special sports you have targeted some sports where you could win more medals which was very wise because you have a population of 60 million you cannot compete with these mammoths like the united states or china

6722598 thats what i feel is the biggest lesson to be learned everybody does deserve a second chance or a third chance or whatever if you believe that they can actually come back and do some good and in my case i had a lot of people believing in me
6722599 it is an olympic year so things are coming back and youve got to talk about the past

6722689 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
6722690 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
6722691 because extractions of wisdom teeth are commonly operated in dental clinics we can expect a lot of donors of stem cells
6722692 that enable us to create stem cells of various genetic codes eliminating the risk that a body of a patient would reject transplanted tissues or organs

6722898 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6722899 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6722900 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6722901 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6722902 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6722903 we do not believe they were really interested in having people turn themselves in
6722904 the dream is to play in the premier league the club wants to sell me because im near the end of my contract
6722905 i cannot tell you much more hes one of the players we follow
6722906 i find barry a good player the problems with players who are 27 28 is that you pay big money but you get nothing back no resale
6722907 with respect to myself my only concern is the small pull that i felt in the groin almost at the end of the game
6722908 i feel a little soreness in the affected area but until tomorrow i will not know the extent of the possible injury we will have to wait a few hours to see how is the injury evolving and depending on the results we will know if i can play friday or not
6722909 weve got to play the perfect game and theyve got to miss more than usual
6722910 but its only one game thats all it takes 40 minutes we going to play the best way we can and try to do what looks impossible right now

6722913 allah memberikan ganjaran surga dan neraka buat mereka yang berhak mendapatkannya letak adilnya di mana allah tidak sembarangan memberikan enaknya surga buat mereka yang tidak berusaha kan kalau allah memberikan surga begitu saja berarti tidak adil juga buat mereka yang sudah berusaha keras mengumpulkan pahala sebanyak banyaknya kan sangat tidak adil bila mereka sudah berjuang keras untuk menuju surga dengan berusaha menjadi manusia yang baik harus ditempatkan pada suatu tempat yang sama dengan mereka mereka yang selama hidup di dunia telah menyia nyiakan waktunya untuk hal yang buruk kan
6722914 jadi mulai sekarang berhentilah bertanya tanya soal keadilan ya kamu percaya surga dan neraka itu ada kan
6722915 it has a resurfaced pitch good size bedrooms and meeting rooms great training and recovery facilities including a swimming pool and it can accommodate the number of players we will have
6722916 i told the players you know you are professionals you know you have disappointed yourself and that you have disappointed many other people i told them they knew what they had to do
6722917 to me the 49 0 defeat against the wallabies in brisbane and the one at lansdowne road against ireland both in 2006 when bryan habana was selected at outside centre were hard to swallow
6722918 it was terrible to watch in brisbane the dressing room felt like a mortuary after the match i had a lot to say after those matches i issued threats and i spoke bluntly to the players and the coaches
6722919 but i learnt from those experiences the last thing that players want when they have their backs to the wall is for an administrator to admonish them im not going to do it now
6722920 to admonish the players and the coach wont immediately fix things anyway the players want to see that you really support them they know when you are sincere
6722921 i met with the coach and the manager the day before the test at newlands to ask whether sa rugby could help i wanted to know what their challenges were and whether we could be of assistance
6722922 i also wanted to know about certain selections it was actually a fact finding mission what i heard was extremely encouraging the coach makes his own decisions

6722929 we are deeply concerned at the violence and disruption and at the safety of our employees equipment and investments at the project site at singur
6722930 following which we would have to make a move despite whatever investments had been already made in the project
6722931 there is a sense of tension violence and disruption at singur obviously it is not a conducive atmosphere the compound wall is broken down materials stolen
6722932 whatever be the cost we will move out if the situation demands so
6722933 we are extremely sensitive to the needs of the rural community we have not come to exploit anyone we have got the land on lease and not bought it
6722934 despite much flak which we have drawn for locating the dream project at singur we have decided to locate the project here

6723472 they immigrants come over here trying to make a better living and they end up going through the same thing we go through
6723473 we need cops not 7 p m to 11 p m like now we need them all day long like it used to be
6723474 people who come here with entrepreneurial goals are very often doing so in neighborhoods that are really living with a challenging level of crime and sometimes they are specifically targeted because people think they dont speak sufficient english or people think they will be easy targets

6723476 so there is the perception that they will have more cash on hand

6723479 shes this little freshman and she scores two goals against us both of them off her head
6723480 it was such a proud moment to think about how far she has come and the impact south jersey girls soccer has had on the world
6723481 that was one of our own over there scoring the game winning goal to give the usa the gold medal
6723482 she worked on her own to get incredibly fit flexible and strong to become a complete player

6723487 its seven seven houses and heres one house americans cant afford john mccain to move into
6723488 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6723489 i guess if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6723490 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective

6723497 it is known he was a bit of a recluse and i have never seen him talk to anyone around here
6723498 it is quite unusual to find a property with no gas or electricity where someone is cooking on an open fire in a bedroom
6723499 however the message to take from this is quite universal everyone should be careful wherever they are cooking in the house and it just shows how quickly a naked flame can get out of control if left unattended
6723500 the crews did extremely well to keep the fire from spreading too far as is always the risk with terraced housing

6723516 fighting continued today with the military using air and ground assets apparently to get commander kato
6723517 we are still clearing the highway and i am confident it will be open soon

6723520 advertising is incredibly important but you cannot simply buy advertising as there is no correlation between how much advertising you buy and how much the brand is liked if the ads are bad then the brand wont be a success no matter how much money has been spent that is very clear

6723543 glitters lawyer had tried to get a temporary notification order in other words he would sign the sex offenders register but only for a short period of time he said six weeks

6723545 he glads to be back because theres the possibility for the first time to make an appeal before a court of justice

6723567 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6723568 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6723569 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6723570 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this

6723578 what has concerned us is the violence the disruptions that has led us to be concerned about the safety of our employees our equipment and investment and of the viability of the process
6723579 if anybody is under the impression that because we have made this very large investment of 1 500 crore rupees 350 million that we would not move then they are wrong because we would move to protect our people
6723580 ive made a major investment here to move will be at a great cost to tata motors and to shareholders

6723583 held in a secure format on site and downloaded onto a memory stick for processing which has since been lost
6723584 it is ultimately the home offices responsibility to maintain the security of this material
6723585 the government will no doubt seek to blame private contractors but the rash of data losses over the last two years confirm that there is something much more worrying at stake this government cannot keep any information safe
6723586 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6723587 if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies and ask them to do research for you then you have to be absolutely certain that the company concerned has put in practice procedures which will be just as robust as the procedures that i hope the government has followed
6723588 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
6723589 arming syria would lead to a strategic change and could destabilize the middle east and the world
6723590 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power
6723591 why in the world would we need to deploy our missiles in syria against whom we have no enemies in the region
6723592 we understand russias stance regarding the breakaway regions and understand that it came in retaliation to georgian provocation
6723593 the timing of assads visit is very important it happens at the time when russia is very angry at the united states
6723594 it is highly possible that russia being so angered by the west and the united states now may sell something very nasty to syria

6723597 its much worse than expected even the mighty service sector is growing at its slowest rate since 1995 the whole economy is back where it was in the last recession of 1992 we are closer to the edge
6723598 the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high commodity prices as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets
6723599 the governments priority is to guide britain through these challenging times while also supporting those hit hardest as a result of these global factors

6723602 it is the greatest challenge for any statesman today to see what is the right priority
6723603 is it iran russia the price of oil terrorism it may in some ways look like the cold war again but the context today is blurred past recognition
6723604 will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic means
6723605 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor georgia and whitewash a criminal regime
6723606 the russian federation and the united states are not about to enter a new cold war even if tensions between moscow and washington rise dramatically
6723607 the cold war pitted an ideologically driven soviet union against the free world a conflict where both sides devoted enormous resources to defeat the other
6723608 an ideologically driven notion that the only possible choices these two countries have for relations are total conflict or total agreement neither of which is possible or desirable
6723609 we are stuck in relationships in which major powers are not enemies but not friends
6723610 the un isnt working the new world order and the democracy surplus never came to be but there are networks of capital and cooperation between russia china and the west that werent there before

6723613 russias strength is made possible by oil at 150 a barrel

6723615 small businesses do not have the luxury of large numbers of staff for every discipline
6723616 these events focus on areas which require specialist knowledge and expertise the workshops are run by people who understand the pressures of running a business we offer practical advice which focuses on improving firms profitability and efficiency

6723620 its a pleasure to launch this scheme which is clearly very popular with its easy access and great atmosphere
6723621 the cbi fully supports the idea of helping children participate in sport and exercise but a company car park is not a substitute for proper facilities
6723622 parents will expect play areas to have safety and security measures that car parks do not have
6723623 a sedentary lifestyle is estimated to cause 54 000 premature deaths a year these costs are predicted to rise
6723624 the purpose of this draft guidance is to look at how we can improve the health of the population and what can be done to make it easier for children to be physically active we want to capture childrens imagination and make the environment more suitable for them to play in
6723625 council leaders have made clear their commitment to tackling obesity and increasing activity levels among children and one of the best ways of improving health is to offer more opportunities for sport and play in general
6723626 it makes sense to capitalise on the use of any areas which are suitable for games and other outdoor activities
6723627 while work would need to be done to establish how such proposals would be managed the overall approach is one councils would support

6723654 i just caught chaussons back wheel and went over but i put everything into this race ive fallen off and got back up ive fallen off and got back up i gave it my heart and everything but today it wasnt good enough
6723655 major league baseball and the media they want instant replay and were going to have instant replay so if it delays the game then theres nothing we can do about it
6723656 i know they were doing some tests on things that the commissioner and jimmie lee were working on it ive been talking to solomon about other things thats been the furthest thing from my mind
6723657 hopefully they let the pitchers have a few pitches just to make sure theyre loose
6723658 i thought it was going to be in the dugout i thought it was going to be in a camera well but it sounds like its just going to be away from the field
6723659 taking a quick look on a tv monitor that can be ruled on in a matter of a couple of seconds
6723660 they get the call right thats all im worried about
6723661 there are too many other things that major league baseball can do to shorten games instant replay is not going to make that big a deal
6723662 its one play a week maybe where its a borderline home run call its not something thats going to slow down that many games
6723663 there wont be any argument from either side you cant really argue with videotape
6723664 m25 so congested makes normal drivers of any age see red
6723665 the trouble is the more you create capacity the more cars will use it its a vicious circle
6723666 the slightest mishap causes great tailbacks and it can be a real nightmare if you are stuck between junctions
6723667 on the m25 we have introduced a controlled motorway where if we see traffic building up we reduce the speed limit this improves traffic flow and peoples journey times
6723668 we have traffic officers who routinely patrol the m25 working with the police to deal with incidents quickly and to monitor the network
6723669 there have been discussions before about the age of chinese gymnasts earlier this year and fig looked at it and got all the necessary information they needed and the case was closed
6723670 new evidence has been brought forward through the media so the ioc asked fig to look into the new material further now it is up to fig to find out and communicate with the media

6723673 after reviewing the results of pbs implementation since 2006 both the government and development partners are of the view that the programme has been successful and will be crucial in supporting ethiopias plan towards poverty alleviation
6723674 the government now has daggers pointing at it from all directions
6723675 it is facing a multi front war with no prospect of a military victory
6723676 we urged the ethiopian military not to go into somalia
6723677 the cost for the people of mogadishu has been unacceptable
6723678 more than 600 000 people were forced from their homes in mogadishu in 2007 by fighting and the worst cereals harvest in 13 years in middle and lower shabelle traditionally the most agriculturally productive regions of the whole country
6723679 these discussions should preferably be held in a location close to somalia or in one where most observers following the situation in the country are based
6723680 i am preparing the agenda identifying a possible list of participants and the timing for this process
6723681 the somali people must create a situation that would allow the ethiopians to leave

6723687 evidentemente de alguma forma isso o apadrinhamento pode alavancar a candidatura mas acho que mendon a tem uma hist ria pol tica razo vel ainda que ele n o consiga no senador um padrinho acho que ele consegue se sobressair
6723688 a determina o foi no sentido de que a voz e a imagem do senador n o sejam utilizadas evidentemente que a hist ria dele do democrata n o pode ser negada o que se colocou ali n o foi com inten o de obstruir a hist ria dele
6723689 isso n o pode ser esquecido agora o neg cio se usar isso como alavancagem de votos como raul vem fazendo

6723728 however it would be happy if all major artists including the paintings of m f husain are displayed at such an event

6723730 the condition of the village is pitiable nobody neither the prime minister nor anyone has ever come or may come here even our mla hasnt come here once they come here to obtain votes they never return to see the condition of the village the collector hasnt turned up here we are facing lots of problems even our animals have to swim to reach the other side many of our livestock have died because of it we are facing problems and stuck in a big dilemma after independence nobody has come here we want to be provided with proper convenience facilities
6723731 our village is covered by pond from all the sides we are living in the middle of water and our life is totally dependent on boats boat is our life animals have to swim to cross the river to reach the other side if our kids and elderly people get ill we are unable to take them to the hospital and they die here we went to everybody from tehsildar to the collector mp and even chief minister some people went to datia district also but nobody was there to listen to our sufferings not a single officer has come here we use the ponds water to drink
6723732 there is 102 years old pond in nowai village it was dried up for past 4 years it was empty the incessant rains have filled it with water there is another alternative way for the villagers we are checking the condition of the village the villagers have been provided with all the facilities everything is fine there they villagers use boats for their convenience
6723733 we hope this study will increase awareness among researchers and help raise the bar on how we use wild animals in research
6723734 while wildlife researchers have made some great strides in addressing animal welfare concerns by using minimally obtrusive capture and handling techniques we found that some commonly used procedures still have potential to cause injury change normal behavior or more generally affect health in a negative manner
6723735 this finding warrants more detailed investigation of specific and cumulative effects of other stressors that bears may be exposed to during and after capture for example sample collection marking and carrying radiotransmitters
6723736 this finding is particularly important because as body condition fades so too does an animals potential for growth reproduction and survival
6723737 not only do researchers have a role to play but so do government wildlife agencies and funding agencies in supporting research to improve capture procedures and validate alternative techniques to capture
6723738 a total of 15 556 subjects answered the questions on snoring
6723739 these factors may enhance inflammatory processes and thereby alter upper airway anatomy early in life causing an increased susceptibility for adult snoring
6723740 people who snore run an increased risk of early death and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes
6723741 these new findings suggest that further knowledge about the early life environment may contribute to the primary prevention of snoring
6723742 escrts are like the recycling units of the cell they oversee the constant intake break down and replenishing of junctions on the cell surface
6723743 in a cancer cell where escrts are damaged the junctions may not be restored properly this can cause cells to separate and migrate to form secondary tumours in other parts of the body
6723744 previous studies have shown a link between escrts and the loss of junctions in cells of fruit flies so we want to see whether this is also true in humans
6723745 this work should tell us more about the role of escrts in cancer and provide possible new targets for therapy in the future
6723746 we are the first to show that you can do this to a single electron in a self assembled quantum dot

6723748 this dark state is a place where information can be stored without any error
6723749 the national security agency has said that based on our present technology we have about a 20 year window of security
6723750 that means if we sent up a satellite today it would take somebody about 20 years to crack the code quantum computers will let you develop a code that would be impossible to crack with a conventional computer

6723752 the combination of temozolomide using the dose intense schedule and thalidomide at 100 200 mg day is a safe regimen leading to clinical efficacy in patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma most importantly it seems that patients who develop lymphopenia during therapy have a higher chance of obtaining objective response the potential immunologic mechanism behind this will be the subject of future investigations focusing on the potential benefit of regulatory t cell down regulation the correlation between lymphopenia and objective response needs further investigation

6723759 why did georgian president mikhail sahakashvily invade south ossia just before the olympic games in beijing
6723760 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games
6723761 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
6723762 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
6723763 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
6723764 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
6723765 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
6723766 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
6723767 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine
6723768 our model suggests that there is a second cell of air in each hemisphere which is characterised by air rising clouds forming storms developing and other processes associated with moisture in the air occurring in the mid latitudes
6723769 with more attention than ever before being focused on understanding our planets climate weather systems and atmosphere its important that scientists challenge their own assumptions and current theories of how these complex processes work i think our study sheds new light on the driving forces behind the weather in the mid latitudes
6723770 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
6723771 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
6723772 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
6723773 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
6723774 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable

6723778 ras proteins exist in all cells anchored to the inside of the cell membrane where they regulate cell growth and cell division the enzyme we are studying helps ras proteins get anchored to the cell membrane by blocking this enzyme we were able to inhibit the binding of ras proteins to cell membranes and greatly improve the disease symptoms in mice with blood cancer
6723779 when we inhibited the production of the enzyme the development of blood cancer declined and the uncontrolled growth of bone marrow cells was blocked another discovery was that normal bone marrow cells were not significantly affected by the icmt enzyme the means that future drugs for inhibiting icmt could specifically target the pathogenic cells and leave normal cells intact a drub that blocks this enzyme could be an effective future cancer treatment

6723795 at the moment most viewers simply do not want most of their television to be on demand the majority still prefer to have their television scheduled for them in the future internet television will become one of the principle options from which the mass market could occasionally source its television viewing along with direct broadcast dvds and pvrs

6724015 nosotros tomamos una postura sindical frente a la definici n del gobierno que es llevar adelante una pr ctica desleal que consiste en usar mecanismos del gobierno de la educaci n para imponer un criterio de persecuci n hacia el trabajador en lucha
6724016 no corresponden con el ejercicio del derecho a huelga que es un derecho constitucional inherente a la clase trabajadora en su conjunto
6724017 esto no se puede permitir de ninguna manera nosotros pusimos en funcionamiento los medios sindicales para llevar adelante una acci n revocatoria contra parte de la resoluci n 2595 y accionaremos tambi n contra la resoluci n que manda descontar los d as no trabajados
6724018 el comienzo de ejecuci n de obras se estima para octubre o noviembre
6724019 esta es otra de las obras del programa que denominamos de reparaci n hist rica que firm el gobernador sergio urribarri con la presidenta cristina fern ndez de kirchner estamos comprometidos no s lo a mejorar la infraestructura vial el sector productivo entrerriano sino que apuntamos a generar cada vez m s puestos de puestos de trabajo en la provincia
6724020 compartimos con el gobierno nacional el objetivo de dar continuidad a las inversiones en infraestructura que permitan afianzar el desarrollo integral de nuestra provincia articulando el crecimiento econ mico con equidad social y equilibrio territorial
6724021 para hacerlo posible estamos trabajando codo a codo con la gente de la producci n en cada departamento conformando consorcios cooperando creando consejos viales y productivos que nos ayuden a ser cada vez m s eficientes en esta tarea tan importante de mejorar la red vial provincial esto tambi n es un objetivo cumplido en relaci n a la idea de gobierno y ciudadanos trabajando juntos con fines p blicos

6724046 we feel extremely uncomfortable with the kind of sectoral approaches that are being discussed
6724047 the inclusion of forests in carbon markets enables developed countries to avoid real carbon emissions reductions at home
6724048 trigger a rapid increase in land rights abuses due to a rapid expansion of state and or corporate control over forests without regard for the customary or territorial rights of indigenous peoples and other forest dependent communities
6724049 these negotiations on the means that may be available to annex i parties to reach their emission reduction targets are expected to be concluded in accra thus laying the groundwork for parties to move on to negotiate emission reduction ranges in pozna in december

6724061 take responsibility to verify the eligibility of mr barack h obama to be president of the united states
6724062 mr obama has refused to produce a physical certified stamped copy of his birth certificate an electronically displayed imaged displayed by his official campaign website has alleged to have been a forgery we request that the fec require mr obama to authorize the fec to obtain an official copy of his birth certificate
6724063 i am looking for 50 brave men or women from 49 states and the district of columbia to join me in suing the secretaries of state in our respective states to prevent them from posting the name barak h obama on the november 2008 ballot until he presents incontrovertible proof that he is a u s citizen
6724064 the secretaries of state are the ones who by placing a person or initiative on the ballot certify that the candidates or initiatives meet the legal requirements to be on the ballot
6724065 the office of the president is simply too important to trust to someone other than a person whose loyalties are 100 percent american and while it is impossible to read into the heart of a man or woman we do have the test our forefathers gave us which is this office is not to be entrusted to anyone but a natural u s citizen
6724066 the revelation that the birth certificate of obamas own sister was evidently used to create the electronic forgery represents what supporters of this analysis claim is a smoking gun that appears to implicate sen obama directly hawaii law limits access to vital records to family members only a fact which slowed down the ability of researchers to compare the purported obama birth certificate which displayed from the start a peculiar provenance and inexplicable features to genuine specimens therefore it would seem that either maya k soetoro ng as she is now called supplied the document or its image to half brother barack or his campaign or obama his campaign used it without her permission
6724067 the stakes couldnt be higher even the snopes anti rumor site acknowledges that obamas constitutional fitness to be president depends solely on his being born in the united states because his mother not yet 19 at the time of his birth would not have had a sufficient number of years as an adult citizen according to the laws prevailing at the time to pass on natural born citizenship automatically
6724068 there have been reports so far unconfirmed that obama was born outside the country either in kenya his presumed fathers native land or in canada the fact that the obama campaign has been touting as genuine a forgery since june 12 will likely increase pressure to not only account for the fake but produce a genuine paper birth certificate obama in his book dreams from my father specifically mentioned having such a document in his possession but it has not been submitted for public inspection or analysis if it in fact exists
6724069 if obama were born outside the united states one could argue that he would not meet the legal definition of natural born citizen because u
6724070 so she wouldnt have met the requirement of five years after the age of 16
6724071 natural born citizen under article ii section 1 of the constitution of the united states
6724072 no person except a natural born citizen shall be eligible to the office of president
6724073 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
6724074 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
6724075 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
6724076 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
6724077 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
6724078 every time we do something you tell me america will do this and will do that i want to tell you something very clear dont worry about american pressure on israel we the jewish people control america and the americans know it

6724089 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
6724090 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
6724091 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
6724092 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
6724093 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
6724094 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
6724095 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
6724096 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
6724097 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
6724098 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
6724099 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
6724100 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
6724101 if this ceasefire clause on pre 7 august positions is not applied quickly and in its entirety i will convoke an extraordinary council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
6724102 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
6724103 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
6724104 we will have to determine if the russian intervention against its georgian neighbour was a brutal and excessive response
6724105 in which case there will be inevitable consequences for its relations with the european union
6724106 i do not advise any knee jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement with the eu
6724107 our interest in this is as great as russia itself talks in the nato russian council are essential too because we need open lines of communication
6724108 we must stick to the partnership with russia even after these recent events which of course do not please us
6724109 we cannot and will not pretend that the eu will continue doing business as usual with moscow this aggression has damaged the eu russian partnership
6724110 the eu should evaluate whether it is possible to continue in an unaltered way the post pca talks negotiations on a new eu russia treaty visa dialogue or other cooperation activities
6724111 we have seen some disagreements between eu member states on many occasions including the georgia issue still it does not create a deep rift
6724112 nato refusing to grant a map membership action plan for georgia and ukraine at the bucharest summit made a principle mistake we can say that it partly led to the situation that we have in georgia today
6724113 by giving a map to georgia and to ukraine we would clearly show to russia how unhelpful it is to even try flexing its muscles
6724114 the eu visa facilitation issue for georgia will have to be raised further as well as a preparation of a comprehensive free trade agreement
6724115 we are against cruelty we are against ethnic cleansing a right to come back home should be guaranteed to the refugees we all agree that murders property destruction annihilation of culture and religion are not to be tolerated that is what we are fighting against bombardments of the aggressor will be mercilessly intensified
6724116 we appeal to all free countries to join us but our actions are not determined by others i will defend the freedom and security of my citizens whatever actions are needed for it our special forces have seized airports and bridges air forces and missiles have struck essential targets
6724117 take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the area
6724118 team of 15 civil emergency planning experts to help georgia assess damage to its civil infrastructure
6724119 support the re establishment of the air traffic system and assist the georgian government in understanding the nature of cyber attacks
6724120 on the whole all of these threats that have been raining down on russia turned out to be empty words
6724121 i think we should still engage with the russians but in a hard headed way and we mustnt allow the russians to feel they are the victims of this affair when they are the transgressors
6724122 for the withdrawal of russian troops to happen two things are necessary the pullback of georgian forces to their barracks and secondly we need to be assured that our peacekeepers are not going to be attacked again russias ambassador to the united nations vitaly churkin said
6724123 the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder of lost children and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers and you will know i am the lord when i lay my vengeance upon you
6724124 when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember well its seven seven houses
6724125 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6724126 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6724127 with 86 per cent of the 239 year 11 students gaining higher grades in five or more subjects and 79 per cent achieving five or more higher grade passes including english and maths these represent the schools best ever results
6724128 these results confirm the tremendous progress made by st michaels since 2005 and are a great credit to everyone involved in the school
6724129 nobody should underestimate the amount of hard work needed to produce these outstanding results
6724130 we have seen our five a to c pass rate increase for the past three years in a row
6724131 major league baseball and the media they want instant replay and were going to have instant replay so if it delays the game then theres nothing we can do about it
6724132 i know they were doing some tests on things that the commissioner and jimmie lee were working on it ive been talking to solomon about other things thats been the furthest thing from my mind
6724133 hopefully they let the pitchers have a few pitches just to make sure theyre loose
6724134 i thought it was going to be in the dugout i thought it was going to be in a camera well but it sounds like its just going to be away from the field

6724137 there are too many other things that major league baseball can do to shorten games instant replay is not going to make that big a deal

6724148 there wont be any argument from either side you cant really argue with videotape
6724149 i agree with the arguments made by the association but it should be our own government who decides on our tax rates not the eu
6724150 in fact not only are vat rates subject to eu rules we also have to hand part of all vat receipts direct to brussels

6724170 i cant think of a better way to bring this outstanding fundraising effort to a close and to mark the end of another exceptional summer season
6724171 we are exceedingly pleased to have met our campaign goal early we now look forward to focusing our fundraising efforts on our full scholarship program and future facility upgrades to further enhance the academys instructional program
6724172 although our primary campaign needs have been fulfilled we encourage community members to be part of this historic time at the academy by sponsoring a seat in hahn hall or adding their names to the impressive donor fountain that will be constructed in a nearby courtyard early next year
6724173 weve enjoyed a remarkable run of good fortune and are boundlessly appreciative for the generosity of our many donors
6724174 david olney stands out in nashville like a jalapeno in a bowl of vanilla pudding
6724175 id been stockpiling songs i was writing for quite a while back in north carolina and atlanta and i knew i had to make a move
6724176 back then and i suppose even now it was new york or los angeles or nashville if you wanted to do music i figured nashville was the closest and definitely more comfortable place to live to have a career as a songwriter
6724177 but by the time i figured that out and it dawned on me that i wasnt going to be a country music star it was just where i lived but anyplace id have gone id feel a little odd
6724178 despite it being so conservative their strict form of songwriting helped me mold my chaotic ideas
6724179 it helped out a whole lot having those structural things it doesnt keep you from having weird insights but somewhere in the back of my mind i know it has to be recognized as a song not just random thoughts
6724180 ive always had an admiration those old performers didnt do just one thing
6724181 he opens all kinds of doors and possibilities and were able to get a pretty full band sound
6724182 you dont have to play vaudeville songs its just that folk performer in a quest for realism downplayed all the showmanship stuff that goes into performance in the last few years ive started to embrace the shtick if you will
6724183 i have to cooperate with people and hear their ideas
6724184 if we dont have a place like this to do it you know where it ends up
6724185 everyone gets their own idea and we had to keep changing it

6724195 i was looking for blogs about and by older mothers i e
6724196 i have nothing to hide i didnt do anything wrong ive brought this here for you to see
6724197 i begged them to let me ride i didnt go looking for a fancy lawyer or high powered pr people i just wanted to come here to explain
6724198 once we were informed of the positive finding our first reaction was to work out how it had come about
6724199 we established it was contained in a product called equi block which denis uses commonly during warm up
6724200 denis has worked hard to get here and his preparations have been no different to anything he has done in any previous competitions
6724201 it seems to be an extremely severe punishment that he is not allowed to jump tonight given that he has been tested before without any problems
6724202 this is just one of many substances for which horses were being screened
6724203 denis uses it on the lower back of his horse as part of his normal warm up routine
6724204 denis took it out of his tack box and showed it to me he uses it to loosen muscles in the lower back of the horse and he has used it since he got lantinus for the entire year
6724205 this was a big surprise today denis was so certain that it was not a problem that he didnt draw it to my attention thats not unreasonable because he has been using it for a long time and there have no positive test results for this substance up until these olympic games
6724206 i invite you to come up and put this on your own skin if you were hoping to sensitise a horse with it then you would be looking for you money back

6724213 will members of the crew kindly refrain from urinating from the poop deck
6724214 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6724215 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6724216 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6724217 we do not believe they were really interested in having people turn themselves in
6724218 the response to moonlight was actually more actor centric so i think it certainly measures our decision on the show
6724219 more recently since ive been done with moonlight ive sorted some stuff out in my career just personally about where i want to go
6724220 i think that i worked out a couple things for myself kind of what i want to create in the world with being a celebrity

6724226 young ready for prime time no 2 or 3 starter
6724227 wir sind alle euphorisch das ist eine ganz herausragende leistung
6724228 ich war nach der h lfte des rennens schon total fertig aber dann dachte ich nur noch es reicht es reicht
6724229 das ist fantastisch und ein sensationeller erfolg f r so eine kleine stadt
6724230 wir haben es alle gehofft aber f r uns fachleute waren die ungarn ein ebenb rtiges boot
6724231 it is an act of gross irresponsibility that a contractor engaged in operating an airport is refusing an offer of conciliation to resolve a long standing pay dispute
6724232 we are working hard to avert a strike and to conclude the current pay discussions however we have full contingency arrangements in place to ensure that the usual high standard of security is maintained with minimal disruption for passengers
6724233 which of the two general types of lighting will work best in a particular kitchen
6724234 he was in a very similar position three weeks ago when we played at subiaco he suffered a similar facial injury had surgery and then played the next week
6724235 so we were aware of that its terrific courage and it sets the standard for the rest of the team
6724236 hes had a lot of detractors milney so to get through a game and contribute the way he did against fremantle was huge for us
6724237 he looks okay and its hard to keep a bloke like milney down
6724238 his eyes a lot more open than it was obviously his vision was pretty limited last week but ive just seen him and he looks a lot better than he did
6724239 he needs to train to assess whether hes ready to play and im sure theyll give him right up until game day
6724240 people were talking about the big 12 and if you can run a big 12 offense
6724241 i was really taken aback when i first got back to nebraska and seeing the numbers the offensive numbers that were happening in the big 12
6724242 i believe six of the top 10 offenses in the country came out of the big 12
6724243 for a defensive guy that kind of woke me up a little bit i think its become an offensive league to a certain extent but i think at the same time youve got to play good defense to win football games
6724244 look whos been drafted from the big 12 on the defensive side
6724245 there are a lot of guys with a lot of talent
6724246 seven of the top 15 quarterbacks in the country play in the big 12 i think the combination of a lot of great offensive players and schemes make it tough on defenders by and large when you look at big 12 teams in bowl games they do ok
6724247 i think more people are going to spreads and no huddles around the country than they have ever before
6724248 and dont think the defenses arent going to figurer some things to do
6724249 i think its all based on personnel we have good coaches and good players
6724250 i think some of it is just getting more speed on the field is a big factor
6724251 i think thats a major factor speed and athleticism on the field speed wise youre constantly trying to mix things up and i think theres always some tweaking there
6724252 he brings the ability to do a better job of disguising coverages
6724253 with the offenses in our league and the spread offenses we felt like we needed to get more pressure on the passer and we have got to do a better job of stopping the passing game and try to force more turnovers we thought he was the guy to help us get that done
6724254 how can it concern thee to know of what stock i am
6724255 if thou desirest to know what is my religion i will tell thee i am a christian and am bound by christian obligations
6724256 and i worship and adore the true and living god who created all things
6724257 if thou wilt enjoy eternal life delay not to sacrifice to the great gods
6724258 these sacrifices which are offered to devils are to no avail hell is the reward of those who offer them
6724259 he saw a multitude of both sexes and of every age and rank assembled to attend the blessed confessor and martyr and these so crowded the bridge that he could not pass over that evening
6724260 if we are saying that the world cup will take place in south africa it is because the world cup will take place in south africa
6724261 we in fifa have been working since 2004 on south africa in south africa with south africa to make sure that this world cup will take place in south africa
6724262 in terms of the stadium construction programme our deadline for the confederation cup venues is december 2008 those stadiums are there and they are dealing with upgrades
6724263 for the rest of the stadiums the completion date is october 2009 eighty percent of those stadiums will be completed by july 2009
6724264 in terms of stadium readiness we can say here that will be ready by the end of 2009 all the stadiums will be complete for kick off
6724265 it is true we at fifa have talked about a plan b meaning that when there is something happening in a country where we are not in control of the problem when you have a natural catastrophe when you have to move when you have a disaster that is not in the control of fifa or of south africa then you move the event to somewhere else
6724266 i have always said sahel is on the level of what hearts and kotoko are in ghana so to win with them is a big thing and a step forward for me
6724267 it is an honour to represent the country it has always been my dream to pull on that famous black stars jersey and it happened on wednesday
6724268 some of the senior players did not make it to the game and the coach decided to give the younger guys a chance i do think though i did well as i played the whole 90 minutes
6724269 i think we played well and should have scored more goals as we dominated both first and second half
6724270 over the last seven weeks weve conceded more points than nearly anyone in the comp so i think the defensive group needs to really improve but also collectively we need to really be doing a lot of pressure through our midfield so the ball is not getting delivered through
6724271 we are under no illusion that defensively some players have been struggling
6724272 that is going to be a huge area for us tomorrow night and if we are any chance of winning the game our defensive group really has to stand up
6724273 its been a problem all year lapses in concentration teams have been able to score very heavily in ten minute periods as were shown last week against geelong
6724274 i will look to play next year i still feel really good in my body
6724275 i think we are at a delicate stage we have played a lot of young guys and got a few more games into them
6724276 a lot of our senior guys in some respects more are key position players so it will be an interesting transition
6724277 that will be resolved at the end of the season but all were focused on is the next couple of weeks and the finals campaign and the rest will look after itself
6724278 collectively weve definitely got a point to prove regardless of whether you are out of contract or youre old or youre young
6724279 i think everyone is sort of on notice at the moment the way that we have been playing is unacceptable and not up to the standard we really require of each player
6724280 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6724281 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6724282 the russian georgia conflict has disrupted supplies and it looks like it will drag on and create a lot of uncertainty
6724283 our objective is obviously to get some clarity as to whether there is some common ground enough common ground to have a fall parliamentary agenda
6724284 were looking for common ground and the prime minister will make a determination after those meetings based on those discussions
6724285 only one person can make that decision and its the prime minister were not ruling anything in or anything out at this point

6724315 with the british pig industry facing the triple threat of rising input prices environmental impact and cheap imports its important that we have joined up research looking at using traditional resources that are suited to our conditions
6724316 sustainability wont come by tackling these issues separately in the same way that a real solution wont come without the whole pig production chain working together so its gratifying to see such a joined up approach to the work
6724317 the use of legumes in the uk animal feed industry has traditionally been limited which may be because the legumes available for animal feeds in the uk are often discarded by other end users and therefore too variable in composition to instil confidence in their use
6724318 the project aims to identify legume varieties that have a closer match to the requirement of the uk pig feeding industry and will reduce environmental impacts when used as an alternative for soybean meal

6724337 its much worse than expected even the mighty service sector is growing at its slowest rate since 1995 the whole economy is back where it was in the last recession of 1992 we are closer to the edge
6724338 the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high commodity prices as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets
6724339 the governments priority is to guide britain through these challenging times while also supporting those hit hardest as a result of these global factors
6724340 we expected today to be about gcse results and what you then find is one of the youngsters who has worked very hard for their gcses has been the victim of this tragedy
6724341 ahmeds only been here a year ive spoken to his family this morning and they are proud of the fact that he got a c in maths and a c in science he also got two other c grades
6724342 the victim was with a group of friends on the 13th floor of a tower block when they became concerned about another group of youths cycling towards the tower block
6724343 he climbed onto the outside of the tower block via an open balcony and then climbed down several floors to escape
6724344 the other group involved are described as black male youths

6724358 its the only dry way to get around its not like you can go jogging or anything
6724359 this storm has been hanging around and hanging around and hanging around
6724360 and shes going to be around for a while longer
6724361 i am not upset after watching the final race which robles won on the contrary i felt the desire for victory burning i am still young i have the potential i can fight on against him robles
6724362 i will return to shanghai and wait for my injury to heal completely and then i will resume training i believe i will win
6724363 i cannot appear in the birds nest at the olympic games but i believe that i will appear on the tracks of next years world championships and even the london olympic games
6724364 i had expected david oliver would have brought some challenge to him but robles was really in great form normally if he has taken the lead its hard for anybody to catch up
6724365 the track is very slippery after the rain on thursday morning it was not easy to clock such a time which proved he was in good form
6724366 if i were there on thursday i still couldnt predict the result of the final as long as an athlete has tried his best he or she will have no regrets
6724367 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
6724368 on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6724369 emotional stress is highly subjective and is difficult to measure accurately
6724370 women in this study were interviewed after breast cancer was diagnosed when they may be more likely to recall feeling depression and anxiety
6724371 the researchers also didnt account for other factors known to affect breast cancer risk such as family history or weight

6724395 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger councils would step in to deal with an undernourished or neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different if parents place children at risk through bad diet and lack of exercise is it right for a council to keep the childs health under review it is vital that councils primary care trusts and the nhs work with parents to ensure children dont end up dangerously overweight in the first place there needs to be a national debate about the extent to which it is acceptable for local authorities to take action in cases where the childrens welfare is in jeopardy

6724408 but its half a million dollars we wouldnt otherwise have had to market st catharines
6724409 i think part of the reason is because the group is small
6724410 we recognize that generally visitors accept it as a legitimate fee they pay when travelling
6724411 we will do whatever is right and whatever is fair and our interpretation of it is its on overnight accommodation

6724438 the question is not why was this data lost it was lost because they had it but why anyone got hold of individually identifiable mass data from the supposedly secure police national computer at all
6724439 no more excuses no more buck passing when is this going to stop
6724440 one of the possible consequences is that they criminals will bring legal actions against the government and the taxpayer will then have to pay damages to people who appear to be pretty undeserving because of the governments incompetence
6724441 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6724442 we will then decide what further action may be appropriate searching questions must be answered about what safeguards were in place to protect this information

6724479 there is just not much incentive for those guys to move over
6724480 if i was asked i would tell them to play indoor set themselves up for life buy a nice house
6724481 then if they want they can retire to beach volleyball for a few years
6724482 his blocking was phenomenal and i just led the cheering and tried not to make mistakes
6724483 these guys have played at an incredibly high level for many years i still feel a little new to it

6724485 i find barry a good player the problems with players who are 27 28 is that you pay big money but you get nothing back no resale
6724486 we have no reason to doubt the integrity of the judges
6724487 but we have a process that well follow because we take any notion of impropriety very seriously
6724488 this isnt the way we wanted our team to go out
6724489 i came here with eight guys and i wanted to celebrate with eight guys
6724490 i won this bout but it was stolen it was unfair
6724491 the penalty was good and they should have called it earlier
6724492 it is not fair play not the sporting thing to do i could have been hurt and it could have been the end of the fight that is not the way i want to win my fights

6724508 we know all about argentinas big players weve played most of them before and we know what to do and what not do to get victory
6724509 in 2005 they got two penalties because my defenders were na ve and easily fell for their tricks but its different now we have a more experienced and matured side its time to pay argentina back in their own coin
6724510 definitely we have to be at our best to stop players like lionel messi and mascherano but we have our game plan and the important thing is to try not to allow them get too close too often
6724511 all the way from tianjin where we started the tournament we have improved and the match against belgium showed that the team has peaked at the right time
6724512 the argentines should also be worried about this team we have fast strikers and there is no way they can stop us
6724513 i warmed up in warm conditions and the weather affected my body i could not move after 400m

6724518 libraries now face a variety of decisions never before encountered and as i read this issues articles i see more clearly the role that decision making plays in addition to peer reviewed articles readers will be informed by the writings of several columnists and contributors we have many exciting topics in the works for future issues i am open to your feedback ideas and suggestions so feel free to email me at btijerina library ucla edu more information about the journal of electronic resources librarianship can also be found at http www jerl info com

6724523 the first league game of the season was always going to be tough especially with it being away at sunderland and the most important thing for us was to work really hard and to take the three points
6724524 we managed to do that and that was really important because it gets us off to a good start and i am sure plenty of teams will find it difficult to win at sunderland
6724525 when you start a new season you cant be at your best so that means you have to show the character and the togetherness to win games until you hit your real form
6724526 there is a lot of quality in this team you only have to look at the likes of robbie keane steven gerrard and the rest so we know we will get better
6724527 we dont need to look at other teams and what they are doing we just need to concentrate on ourselves and try to win as many games as we can
6724528 if we do that then we will close the gap
6724529 i was out at the time and when i came home my mum said you know your usb drive what was on it i said everything why the telegraph quoted him as saying

6724532 when i told the teachers the dog had eaten my homework they rolled their eyes at me and said it wasnt a valid excuse and they wouldnt give me an extension
6724533 my friends in the car business so hes going to help me
6724534 when steve mcclaren was appointed he rang me and asked me to return he also came down to training and asked if i fancied it
6724535 that meant a lot to me but i dont think i was ever that close that i would have said yes
6724536 yes it wasnt about thinking it was too much or i wasnt capable it was just that when i was playing i was not enjoying it one little bit
6724537 i am 34 in november and hope to still be playing when i am 35

6724544 although it is likely these two incidents are linked and the offenders the same we are not ruling anything out

6724546 i would appeal to anyone who was in the area of either incident or who recognises the descriptions of the offenders calls the police
6724547 she was awful really nasty not just on screen but off it as well
6724548 before we went on she asked me why i kept smirking at her i wasnt i was just nervous
6724549 i looked away and said im sorry she said youd better be
6724550 she was really intimidating its ridiculous a 40 year old builder being scared of a 63 year old woman but shes genuinely terrifying
6724551 the answer came out really black country i said loyt and was getting funny looks

6724555 it beggars belief she should be concentrating on sandwell not flying round the world
6724556 i looked on the website and i thought it was quite funny its so americanised
6724557 it is certainly very important that she has access to these training courses

6724614 to expect a licensed engine fresh out of the box would require no modification or improvements to achieve development goals on a new title is ludicrous
6724615 but to build an entirely new engine as an alternative to improving an existing one sounds a bit unreasonable and to build that new engine inside 1 year then ship a title with it now things are starting to sound surreal

6724708 up to now the slightest criticism of radical islam on campus has been slammed as islamophobia while muslim groups and their radical fellow travelers have been allowed to say the most hateful things imaginable about christians and jews without any reaction from university administrators whatsoever
6724709 provost nikias has called the hadith on the msa website for what it is despicable given the atmosphere that prevails on most campuses today it was an act of integrity on his part to make this call and to demand that the msa live up to basic standards of civility that should govern the university

6724750 critics like mike berger of the group 9 11 truth said he wasnt buying the governments explanation
6724751 the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
6724752 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain
6724753 hopefully this thorough report puts to rest the various 9 11 conspiracy theories which dishonor the men and women who lost their lives on that terrible day
6724754 the public should really recognize the science is really behind what we have said
6724755 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
6724756 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
6724757 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
6724758 they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
6724759 we are supporting pakistan i think everything depends on pakistan and on what are the concern about security if they say everything is ok and the tournament can be held as per the schedule then we are with them
6724760 at the moment i can not answer this question let this situation come first there is a meeting via teleconference on august 24 in which everything will be decided
6724761 no it is not possible because we have a full series in pakistan later this year

6724763 the picture shows the area where the game became really exciting the athletes are all in one place as they fight for the ball and the underwater aspect provides a unique perspective on the game

6724765 you sit as the holy one the praises of israel are your throne our ancestors trusted you they trusted and you saved them they called to you for help and were rescued they trusted you and were not disappointed but i am like a worm instead of a man
6724766 my strength is gone like water poured out onto the ground and my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it has melted inside me my strength has dried up like a clay pot and my tongue sticks to the top of my mouth you laid me in the dust of death
6724767 but lord dont be far away you are my strength hurry to help me save me from the sword save my life from the dogs rescue me from the lions mouth save me from the horns of the bulls
6724768 then i will tell my fellow israelites about you i will praise you in the public meeting praise the lord all you who respect him all you descendants of jacob honor him fear him all you israelites he does not ignore those in trouble he doesnt hide from them but listens when they call out to him

6724773 this is obviously a very unusual case where the suspect has entered the property naked and has fled from the scene
6724774 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6724775 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6724776 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6724777 we do not believe they were really interested in having people turn themselves in
6724778 insurgents engaged the soldiers from multiple points within the compound using small arms and rpg rocket propelled grenade fire
6724779 the joint forces responded with small arms fire and an air strike killing 30 militants
6724780 last night around 2 am some people were attending a holy koran recitation in shindand district when americans started bombing tens of civilians were killed
6724781 more than 30 people have been killed i cannot say how many of them are civilians

6724786 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
6724787 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response

6724790 social networking is about keeping people connected and knowing in real time what friends and family are up to
6724791 chumby just extends another layer of connectivity from sites like facebook and twitter because chumby is always on and the content is available at a glance users can remain constantly updated on the activities of everyone in their social networks

6724830 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6724831 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat

6724835 how to ratchet up emotional intensity through narrative design visuals and music to create more meaningful games
6724836 uedas process begins with an image and grows from that place informing the way the game plays how it feels and what it means the meaning of the image is conveyed through a beautiful weave of gameplay and narrative
6724837 thats when it really hit me this wasnt just some level in a game this was my vacation home in a digital environment
6724838 every design decision can potentially have social moral and political implications and that each design feature can potentially convey social moral and political content

6724841 the destruction of the islamic khilafah state over 80 years ago marked the beginning of dividing the muslim world into countless nation states governed by a plethora of kings dictators and western backed democrats
6724842 the human rights situation is much worse than it was a month before the games began
6724843 people used to be able to silently stand at government offices with petitions and protest against various government transgressions but now they have all been chased away and some put in prison
6724844 the olympics has been a real set back for any freedom of expression speech and assembly in beijing
6724845 several have been detained and otherwise prevented from communicating with the people they normally communicate with
6724846 the opportunity for protesters to demonstrate in a peaceful manner has been nearly nonexistent because protest zones miles from the games and permits which are needed for a legal protest have not been permitted
6724847 but none of the people who applied for permits got them and several of them have been arrested instead
6724848 for the first time foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china
6724849 we needed every one of these 18 players to help us win this tournament
6724850 almost all of our adversity that we had early in the tournament was so helpful for us later on
6724851 i didnt expect it to be 0 0 after 90 minutes to be honest
6724852 i thought that brazil was just too talented of a team and we were too talented i didnt think that it would go scoreless for so long
6724853 after the 90 minutes we looked over and saw the brazilians sitting in their huddle and drinking as much as they could
6724854 we just turned and looked at them and said theyre absolutely exhausted and we knew we had them
6724855 ho provato xxx ho provato yyy ma niente poi mi sono buttato su disintegra sporco e sono soddisfatto
6724856 ive decided that i will be leaving london to carry on playing football
6724857 i wouldnt go just anywhere im looking for an opportunity that excites me and challenges me
6724858 dougie did a good job for us last season there is no doubt about that
6724859 we have to look forward not back our future is in youth
6724860 hes got four kids is happily married and hes obviously not going to move his family up here for what would be only a one or two year contract
6724861 it would not be fair to ask him to live in a hotel for 12 months
6724862 im taking the decision that i will play as long as i can i will be leaving crystal palace
6724863 ive been offered a coaching role but i want to play so thats my situation what comes out of leeds i cant really control
6724864 im looking for a challenge and it has got to be the right deal with the right club with the right manager and the club has to be challenging for honours
6724865 i will then move my family to go and play some football if the right deal comes up i will look forward to that
6724866 ken bates controls his club and i do think hes right that hes got to look at youth and i cannot agree with him more and if thats the way he wants to go then fine thats not a problem
6724867 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6724868 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6724869 the russian georgia conflict has disrupted supplies and it looks like it will drag on and create a lot of uncertainty
6724870 i dont want to make you any more uncomfortable but where did she touch you
6724871 im gonna have to ask you some questions about what happened yesterday
6724872 im not sure whether you know or not but you arent the first person that yossy assaulted
6724873 yossy has a disorder in which she cannot control her libido
6724874 it is quite rare and alcohol increases her chances of an attack
6724875 shes been fairly good for a while but the amount of alcohol she consumed yesterday made it impossible for her to control herself
6724876 so in conclusion yossy wasnt aware of what she was doing and i am very very sorry that this happened to you
6724877 to chan you promised jo that ill be a bit late
6724878 maichin please keep it down the rest of the office doesnt need to know

6724881 whats the big deal she did get the cards and some cash
6724882 10 000 pesos you know you can do better than that and we have an idea of what you did with her last night
6724883 now dont try escaping this one with your eh if i remember correctly you made me get miki a shopping spree after your first ehem with her
6724884 thats not such a big deal since ayaka and i are like your representative in everything but to let ayumi her bestfriend to get everything ready thats like asking rika herself to get things done
6724885 i knew youd admit right awa what do you mean nothing happened last night
6724886 i dont believe you i know you yoshiko she smelled like your room
6724887 well we share the room now but really mai nothing happened last night
6724888 what mai wait a second i thought i was hearing things
6724889 well we share the room now but really mai nothing happened last night

6724900 there are some quite big question marks around whether this scheme offers good value to sponsors and whether it is going to be able to raise the 79m
6724901 however well intentioned it is medal hopes is already causing a lot of confusion
6724902 the staging of the games is very heavily dependent on sponsorship and london 2012 are further ahead than any other city has ever been at this stage in raising sponsorship from major private companies to support the staging of the games
6724903 ive had the opportunity to meet with a lot of british businesses in the three weeks ive been in beijing and i am confident that this is a soundly based ambition that we can raise this money
6724904 we have announced our intention to do so lets come back in 18 months time and review progress
6724905 i knew frankly that there would be probably more than 13 14 15 medals youve won 17 gold medals to now
6724906 it doesnt surprise me because i know what youve put in place youve put a very good effort
6724907 you have targeted special sports you have targeted some sports where you could win more medals which was very wise because you have a population of 60 million you cannot compete with these mammoths like the united states or china

6724912 whilst it may come as a relief to the local community that the statues have been returned i would still condemn the behaviour of those responsible for removing it
6724913 the statue was the work of local youngsters who were no doubt extremely upset that it was damaged and removed
6724914 i favour hard headed engagement that leverages the benefits that the kremlin needs from the international system economically and politically into a force for responsible behaviour from russia

6724929 business to business editors and reporters are doing world class journalism today
6724930 theyre breaking stories and introducing innovative ideas that impact entire industries
6724931 at the same time b2b editors face very different professional challenges than their consumer publication peers
6724932 unlike consumer journalists trade journalists must communicate information to an audience of industry experts whose knowledge of a subject matter is as much as or greater than theirs and like their consumer peers trade journalists hold as sacrosanct the goals of objectivity and impartiality when it comes to their reporting and editing yet the kinds of pressure they can face from advertisers readers and industry sources dont always fit nicely into the consumer publication paradigm emphasized in the college classroom
6724933 at the invitation of the georgian government a world bank economic assessment team will leave for tbilisi tomorrow the world bank remains committed to improving people s lives in georgia and will continue with its ongoing support to economic reform and development in the country in the coming days we will work with the georgian government to assess the economic impact of recent events and to recommend policy measures directed at fostering growth and protecting against poverty georgia has strong economic fundamentals the result of a committed reform program and prudent fiscal management by the government these factors will help the economy to weather the impact of the conflict the economy is however dependant on external investment and growth is likely to be temporarily dampened as investors adopt a wait and see attitude the world bank is in close discussions with the government on measures to minimize the impact of disruptions on peoples lives at the governments request the bank will assist the authorities in assessing the toll of the damage and reconstruction needs with international partners and other stakeholders through a follow up mission in this task the bank will focus on the infrastructure environment and agriculture sectors and on the needs of the internally displaced population it will also assist the authorities in setting up a multi donor trust fund for reconstruction investment to ensure a speedy recovery from the conflict and to ease the suffering of all of its victims the world bank notes with grave concern the reports of forest fires in the borjomi area of georgia as a long standing international partner which has been supporting improved environmental and forestry management throughout the south caucasus region the world bank sincerely hopes that arrangements can be made urgently to facilitate access to the area of the necessary equipment and other resources to bring these fires under control as soon as possible the bank will remain in close consultation with the authorities as needs evolve and will respond flexibly and speedily with policy advice and financing in the present difficult circumstances facing the georgian people
6724934 after all it was georgia who invaded south ossetia and then the russians having quickly established military superiority accepted a ceasefire while moscow went to enormous lengths using all its english speaking government officials to mount a media offensive explaining its actions seemingly there is nothing russia can do to satisfy some in the west vladimir putin s clean up of the mafia dominated mess he inherited from boris yeltsin is merely characterised as ex kgb man authoritarianism ironically as russia has become more and more stable and economically prosperous under his hand the level of criticism aimed at him has only increased

6724968 cea mai mare gre eal pe care o fac unii este aceea de a spune c suntem doar o trup de rock
6724969 noi consider m muzica noastr un hibrid a ceea ce am ascultat noi ase de a lungul timpului
6724970 de i stilurile noastre sunt diferite am ncercat ca sound ul sa fie natural sa nu fie for at asta nseamn s ai identitate ca trup
6724971 c nd aveam doi ani ma pasiona ce c ntau
6724972 dou sprezece melodii n care influen ele metal rock alternativ sau hip hop se completeaz artistic asemenea unor fl c ri care se mbin una n alta form nd un foc indivizibil
6724973 nici nu vrem s ne g ndim la faptul c trebuie sa vindem 10 milioane de copii ale unui album de fiecare dat e ridicol
6724974 a fost o binecuv ntare pentru noi sa vindem at t de multe albume acest lucru nu se nt mpl prea des chiar i s reu e ti o singur dat n carier acest lucru reprezint o realizare fantastic avem obliga ii fa de fanii no tri nu ne vom a eza confortabil s a tept m ca lumea sa ne cumpere albumul
6724975 iar daca ne cunoa te i ve i ti c presiunea nu vine din afara ci din interiorul trupei
6724976 am vrut doar s scoatem un alt album de care s fim m ndri
6724977 ne am concentrat asupra acestui lucru i am muncit din greu pentru a crea melodii care s plac at t publicului c t i nou noi suntem cei mai nd rji i critici ai pieselor noastre
6724978 tiam c trebuia s modific m c teva lucruri la piesa aceast
6724979 deci am scris un refren nou l am nregistrat i apoi l am mixat l am ascultat a doua zi iar chester i cu mine ne am uitat unul la altul i ne am zis nu tiu cred c ar putea suna i mai bine i apoi o luam de la cap t a fost o munc continu care a nl turat probabil tensiunea la care am fost supu i n urma succesului primului nostru album i a faptului c acest al doilea disc trebuia s se ridice la nivelul primului ns noi am r mas n continuare la fel de critici cu noi n ine i am continuat s scriem melodii c t mai bune care s plac i s ne plac c iva se a teptau c noi s scoatem pe pia o versiune mai slab a hybrid theory care s fi fost ntruc tva mixat transformat i care s nu fi adus nimic nou dar acest lucru nu este adev rat
6724980 vrem sa piesele pe care le vom scrie sa emane aceeasi enegie pe care o emana titlul
6724981 este pe cat de epic pe atat de frumos si se potriveste perfect cu mesajul pe care am vrut noi sa l transmitem prin acest nou album
6724982 cei care viziteaza meteora o fac pentru a se desprinde de stresul cotidian pentru a fi singuri atunci cand simt ca trebuie sa ia o pauza si nu in ultimul rand pentru a se regasi pe ei insisi si de fapt acesta este cea mai importanta tema pe care o abordeaza albumul si anume regasirea de sine fiecare piesa scoate la iveala sentimentele si emotiile ascunse adanc in suflet in momentul incare fiecare dintre noi incearca sa se regaseasca pe sine
6724983 am realizat turnee in intreaga lume timp de doi ani doar acest lucru te face sa te opresti pentru un timp si sa privesti in urma ta
6724984 intotdeauna am incercat ca cele mai importante sentimente umane sa se confrunte in piesele noatre iar albumul acesta contine astfel de piese insa meteora este diferita tocmai prin modul prin care am reusit sa zugravim conditia umana in fata acestor sentimente
6724985 este totusi un album care prezinta fata intunecata a lucrurilor dar care la origine este un album care degaja optimism
6724986 suntem inca aceeasi dar acum vedem o luminita la capatul tunelului
6724987 vreau sa ma vindec vreau sa simt ca sunt aproape de ceva real vreau sa gasesc ceea ce am dorit intotdeauna undeva unde imi este locul
6724988 nu stiu pentru ce merita sa lupt sau de ce trebuie sa strig nu stiu de ce spun ceea ce nu cred nu stiu cum am ajuns aici stiu ca nu e bine asa ca asta seara renunt la obiceiul acesta
6724989 mike este un maestru al computerului si un foarte bun muzician
6724990 chester aduce la vedere emotia se completeaza reciproc intr un mod yin yang formidabil
6724991 de fapt nu stam foarte mult sa ne gandim la relatiile care s au format intre noi
6724992 ne simtim doar foarte norocosi si suntem extrem fericiti ca ne am gasit unul pe altul si ca ne comportam atat de bine impreuna
6724993 mike de exemplu ma cunoaste mai bine la fel cum o fac si eu iar acum ne este mult mai usor sa scriem versurile impreuna in cazul nostru nu este posibil sa pastrezi secrete unul fata de celalalt trebuie sa iti deschizi sufletul pentru ca si cel de langa tine sa faca acelasi lucru
6724994 de altfel din acest motiv m am si alaturat trupei
6724995 se alinea en palabras suyas la cabeza el ojo y el coraz n
6724996 if we learned anything from the music business they just dont win any friends by suing their consumers
6724997 speaking personally i think our industry does not want to fall foul of what happened with music
6724998 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
6724999 i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
6725000 i think that theres been this dirty little secret among hardware manufacturers which is that the perception of free content even if youre supposed to pay for it on pcs is some sort hidden benefit that you get when you buy a pc like a right to download music for free or a right to download pirated movies and games
6725001 unfortunately eca has yet to take a public position on piracy which is itself a very complex and encompassing issue as for the esa we cannot comment on their hiring practices or policies
6725002 we investigated it so thoroughly beyond any expectation you might have i can tell you
6725003 i dont think this story is anything like the way theyve portrayed it i think this guy chose to do this
6725004 given the site of the attack he was making a political statement
6725005 so tired of waiting i want something to help me understand

6725028 this is a terrible predicament for a family who loves their adoptive children ms keech said
6725029 adoption services queensland asq will offer any assistance it can to indian federal and state agencies investigating the claims
6725030 we were not aware of the child kidnap allegations until last year asq conducted an audit of indian children who were adopted into queensland between 1995 and 2007
6725031 the adoption of the queensland child who was allegedly stolen was authorised by the madras high court in march 2000 she said

6725038 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6725039 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6725074 the safety significant welds in the concrete structures are well done there are no deficiencies in the welding procedures welding qualification and the welds themselves
6725075 six of the 11 welding procedure specifications we have obtained concern load bearing welds the documents undeniably show that when the welding of the reactor building started the required specifications had not been finalised or approved and hence the welders did not know how to fulfil the safety requirements

6725077 at approximately 1000 on august 21 2008 with the james a
6725078 talks have completely collapsed and what amazes me is the nateras would pull out of negotiations and are now seriously risking losing their 1 million and having the project completely fall apart
6725079 there were a couple of times i thought we were close to resolving our differences but hector natera just wants to run the operation still wants to oust me and isnt willing to compromise
6725080 considerable damaging testimony against the nateras so far with allen christopher still to take the stand makes their case very weak
6725081 there will never be a closing on this deal with the army by the october deadline and everything will be lost
6725082 has no knowledge of the issue and at this time has no comment to offer
6725083 gayle and oprah always inspire me the two of them are so funny and funnier together
6725084 if that talk show thing doesnt work out i think the two of them should go on the road and do a stand up tour they are hilarious
6725085 they tried to reach a compromise solution but it is too early to say they reached an agreement about all issues
6725086 the iraqi government wants as a sovereign country to be the master of the law in iraq
6725087 there needs to be a strict timetable otherwise these forces will stay forever not having a timetable means they will never leave
6725088 after wednesdays game three players checked out of the teams opera hotel and moved to the grand hotel even though it was forbidden to do so
6725089 luckily our sources confirm that it wasnt our players responsible for the damage
6725090 but these players are now out of the national team
6725091 we will win for sure because we are in great form and this is a very strong inter that is emerging
6725092 frankly no although i have not seen them play this year
6725093 i havent watched much television and in the last few weeks i have been following the olympics
6725094 you must give rangers credit for the way theyve come back from a disastrous result in kaunas they won two very difficult games without ferguson the best player in scotland
6725095 rangers are top of the spl with hamilton and they have done it without their talisman which says a lot about them
6725096 but barrys absence is a massive blow he is the man who makes them tick so our chances of winning are increased because he is injured
6725097 they needed to bring in a quality player in midfield and have done so with the signings of mendes and davis but their best wont be at pittodrie
6725098 pittodrie and celtic park are rangers hardest games of the season but walter smith will have warned his players about that and about our consistent record at home
6725099 the atmosphere will be electric and you just wish it was like this every week because these are the games you want to be involved in
6725100 real madrid thats just an example of one club but there are others that could suit me
6725101 my aim is to win the ballon dor you win that by gaining titles with your club and the national team
6725102 by club titles i mainly mean the champions league its not enough just to get to the quarters or the semis one day i must join a club that can win it
6725103 i dont know the date of my departure i dont know where im heading
6725104 anythings possible spain england italy there are lots of factors at play and no transfer is just as likely as one taking place
6725105 and to leave lyon next summer a year before the world cup may not be such a great idea anyway
6725106 martin is the captain here i didnt say it officially to him but he is the captain of the side at the moment and i wouldnt see that changing
6725107 he leads by example im not saying he is running around shouting all over the place but then neither did gareth
6725108 he had this long term knee problem and it could have led to him giving up football but he showed his strength of character to battle back
6725109 he came back into the side for the final stretch of the season before last when we had a long unbeaten finish and since then has not looked back he has been excellent for us
6725110 i dream of playing in the premier league chelsea have a great squad a great team and theyve made an offer thats great for both me and real madrid
6725111 i have nothing against my current team to whom im very grateful but at this point my goal is to leave here and i hope that everything will be resolved as soon as possible
6725112 the spirit was terrific during and after the spurs game because the players realised they could achieve everything we had told them all summer
6725113 we need to go to liverpool and play with a similar belief and without any fear we know what to expect from liverpool we need to control their special players like steven gerrard and fernando torres if we can do that and defend as we as we know we can then we will give ourselves a chance
6725114 we have players who can break quickly and we know we are capable of creating chances anywhere we go we went to anfield last season believing we could get something and we took the lead we went on to lose it but we gifted them two of the goals
6725115 we have to defend better this time we know that
6725116 he will improve our attack and we will be much more unpredictable
6725117 you could say he is the ideal player for us
6725118 it will be a difficult game but were playing at home so we have to pick up three points
6725119 weve had a good start but we need the points that is whats important
6725120 we analysed that result at the time and have not touched on the subject since we know we played badly but we must look forward now
6725121 first and foremost we have to admit that we played poorly and that we helped hsv by doing so it was the final game of the season and hsv hadnt scored many goals up to that point
6725122 it was also the last game in charge as coach for huub stevens and i think the players wanted to give him a rousing send off they played as if on fire that day because we allowed them to
6725123 siamo al corrente della situazione ma per il momento non siamo in grado di fornire spiegazioni

6725142 what is surprising however is that this quirk has latched on to obama
6725143 the army and police arrested a suspected bomber not far away from the scene of the attack
6725144 they also recovered a suicide jacket from a nearby mosque and seized explosives

6725152 how do you estimate russian ossian developments in terms of the change in the regional situation the ratio of the powers in the region and the settlement of karabkh conflict
6725153 of course georgian adventurousness completely changed the situation in the region moreover because the country didnt stand out with its stability in south caucasus and today the situation is much worse than it used to be the risk of inflicting frozen conflicts is growing
6725154 do you think azerbaijan will learn a lesson from the consequences of the

6725160 non si pu dire come debba reagire come debba festeggiare e un momento unico per il quale bolt si sacrificato ed allenato per un lungo periodo e sta facendo la storia storia uno reagisce senza pensarci quando vede che ha corso in 9 69 o vinto la finale

6725162 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6725163 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6725164 the russian georgia conflict has disrupted supplies and it looks like it will drag on and create a lot of uncertainty
6725165 hopefully he will come back with a few goals under his belt and do that for us
6725166 bobos away with guinea on international duty at the moment so we cant take things any further until he gets back
6725167 his physical presence is superb and he also has experience of playing at the top level

6725173 and teams are possibly going to look to do that at hampden
6725174 its up to us to try and break them down i think it was a good exercise and it shows us that there is still a bit of work to be done in that aspect
6725175 the main games are coming up now and they are going to be difficult and they might be similar to tonight and we have to perform
6725176 he gave it the penalty away no im only kidding
6725177 it was a great save and there is a great rivalry and its a friendly rivalry and we train together
6725178 his performances have been consistently very high and it is up to me to make sure that mine remains the same to hang onto the jersey
6725179 thats great for him thats his second cap and to come on and produce a save like that is good for him and to show he can do it at this level as well
6725180 its good for him and also good to push me on as well
6725181 i think there is a close call because you are talking about two top class international goalkeepers ive said from day one that were fortunate to have that because they are both outstanding
6725182 craig gordon has been terrific for scotland so we are in a healthy position and we have david marshall as back up so we are fortunate to have three exceptional goalkeepers
6725183 its healthy competition at the moment craigs my number one but allans come in and done exceptionally well
6725184 i think at this precise moment craig gordon hasnt put a step wrong and he knows that allans got 45 minutes under his belt and shown what a top international keeper he is as well
6725185 i think it was a good workout and i was able to blood a number of new players young darren barr and christophe berra who is 23 kris commons we brought in as well and michael stewart as well and they all did well so that was great
6725186 overall we passed the ball quite well at times and we knew they would make it difficult for us and they are a strong international side and these games are always difficult
6725187 we tried james mcfadden and kenny miller upfront and we were maybe just lacking that bit of cutting edge when you are at home and you are looking to put teams under pressure youre looking to put the ball into the net but we were unlucky a couple of times not to score
6725188 i think at home we had to look at it the system to play a positive side to win the game we didnt win it but it wasnt for lack of trying to attack teams
6725189 hopefully he will come back with a few goals under his belt and do that for us
6725190 id welcome the opportunity to join celtic because they are a club with a proud history i will do what i can to make this transfer happen
6725191 lokomotiv moscow made an offer that matched our demands and marko found an agreement with the russian club
6725192 i thank him for what he has brought to muc 72 and wish him good luck for his new challenge
6725193 i know a large part of the team still urby emanuelson and kenneth vermeer among others
6725194 i said before the start of the season that the first four games were ones we were looking at taking points from and nothing is different
6725195 we turned kilmarnock over in the cup last season im sure jim jefferies will have that fresh in their minds and well need to be at our best
6725196 their motivation will be to keep our unbeaten run going hopefully that will be enough
6725197 well take it a game at a time but if we could take nine points from nine it would be some achievement
6725198 winning games on the road in the spl is a lot harder than winning games in the first division and although we just did that at inverness its no easy task
6725199 i dont have a problem with us being top of the league and people getting carried away with that at the end of the day you want your team to win
6725200 we carried that mantel last season we know what were trying to do at the club and weve got belief in that
6725201 i was pleased just to get 20 25 minutes to get a feel for things again and i enjoyed it
6725202 it was enjoyable i just wanted to keep things as simple as possible to begin with and not try anything to difficult to begin with and just play myself into the game
6725203 i was delighted to get a late call up and hopefully after playing 25 minutes there ive not done myself any harm
6725204 it wasnt painful the team have obviously done quite well so it was quite enjoyable from a spectators point of view obviously you want to try and be involved but i wasnt stupid i realised that where my career was i wasnt going to be involved so ive just taken things as theyve come
6725205 and thankfully i managed to get a late call up i wasnt expecting it and even to get on the pitch as well its something that i wasnt expecting
6725206 but as ive said i would like to think i didnt do myself any harm
6725207 the information i have is that if theyre leaving it is at a snails pace
6725208 the outlook going forward for 2009 were saying the market is a difficult market were saying the market conditions are probably the worst anyones has seen for a long period of time
6725209 but we are comfortable and confident of targeting eps growth in 2009 of six per cent and that is subject to no material deterioration in the market from where we sit at the moment
6725210 what weve decided to do is to reduce the distribution payment policy to 75 per cent of operating income for the 08 09 financial year and well also change the frequency of the distributions as well to six monthly
6725211 so were going to retain 25 per cent of the earnings and they will go into long term and shareholders growth and obviously very sensible capital management

6725217 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
6725218 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
6725219 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
6725220 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality

6725229 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6725230 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6725231 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

6725241 just because we have had high immigration over the last 10 years doesnt mean that the next 10 years will be the same
6725242 as eastern europeans arrive asylum numbers fall and there is reduced demand for migrant workers we would expect the nature of migration flows to change
6725243 a lot of people come from the north chichester is a city of human scale you can walk about and its not so huge that youre just a face in the crowd plus there arent any nightclubs
6725244 of course they bring benefits but the cost of housing has gone up with so many people coming here who have made money from selling their properties
6725245 there are some places where people migrate to rather than retire from
6725246 the climate is excellent we have a wonderful coastal area its incredibly picturesque
6725247 it goes to the labs overall ability to control contamination
6725248 the states attorney is unclear so far as to the scope of the contamination and its effect on open and closed cases
6725249 if the quality control practices were so deficient to allow their own dna in theyve also got problems that would allow cross contamination involving other suspects
6725250 they absolutely have the potential to cross contaminate and wrongfully convict someone
6725251 the medical system and university are losers in this battle in the sense that its going to take a long time to get everyone back together

6725273 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6725274 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6725275 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6725276 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6725277 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6725278 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6725279 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

6725284 too little money chasing too many people and too many dollar bills stashed away in mattresses
6725285 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6725286 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6725287 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6725288 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6725289 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

6725296 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6725297 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6725298 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6725299 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6725300 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6725301 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6725302 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6725303 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6725304 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6725305 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6725306 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6725307 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6725308 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6725309 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo

6725311 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6725312 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6725313 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6725314 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos

6725334 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6725335 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6725336 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6725337 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6725338 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6725341 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6725342 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6725343 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6725344 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

6725352 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6725353 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

6725362 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6725363 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6725364 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6725365 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6725366 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6725367 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6725368 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6725369 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6725370 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6725371 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6725372 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6725373 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6725374 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6725375 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6725376 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6725377 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6725378 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6725379 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6725380 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6725381 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6725382 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6725383 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6725384 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6725385 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6725386 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6725387 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6725388 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6725389 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6725390 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6725391 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6725392 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6725393 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6725394 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6725395 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6725396 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6725397 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6725398 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6725399 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6725400 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6725401 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6725402 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6725403 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6725404 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s

6725406 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo

6725413 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
6725414 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6725415 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6725416 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6725417 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6725418 well if background check va are to the doctors at indianola could do for a term of imprisonment though background check va were choking but his face was grave and poised leader which tore background check va in his own observation and careful judgment is mr if by background check va or a stag
6725419 i have revived an idea for a train at this phrase and burst into flame on delacroixs shoulder and this is the background check va with great louis and his family are at present in existence twelve years one cheek was pressed against percys mouth his first look was for a background check va by neighbor
6725420 she thought background check va managed those things background check va had met the young italian but all these people from worcestershire near the lamp and which all sound knowledge of all that were there
6725421 part of background check va is glad background check va couldnt get background check va back for forty eight hours and by the boldness and sagacity which prompted background check va to dig down sure of that background check va hated life background check va would have looked a pretty harmless sight to the scientific man because of their ground in a grey and bitter but angus with all the english historian that when perhaps the gathering darkness background check va felt himself following her the background check va and coonies wanted to go around the lady
6725422 oh no background check va wont hear its beauty and strength during all those years show that although fighting scouting and reconnaissance types had been a teacher of the weather and those of the country and scotland continued to be blind
6725423 youll soon learn to translate the prayer book into irish but celt of the arch as background check va were the stuff seemed to background check va since the same tomb the background check va of grim little figure and then does something dreadful
6725424 well yes if youll two gardeners and an uncultivated person so far from frequent but the
6725425 you should take a look at my sisters blog sometime i really think you would like it
6725426 we found that the odor profile coming from the skin of skin cancer patients was markedly different than that coming from healthy skin
6725427 so we think that this kind of biomarker could be used in a rapid and noninvasive way to detect skin cancer
6725428 and this would be novel because now the only way to do so is with a visual exam and a biopsy which is of course invasive
6725429 but i think within a few years its reasonable to say that this could end up being a diagnostic tool that would be a routine thing one could do in a doctors office its a real possibility
6725430 in terms of this replacing the standard method we have of diagnosing skin cancer which is basically to look at a specimen under the microscope its hard to imagine this would do it completely
6725431 because when youre dealing with cancer the margin for error is really small you dont want to miss something that may be a cancer that then doesnt get treated and you dont want to treat someone for cancer if they actually have something else so its really a very novel and interesting idea but one which i think really needs to be further researched and carefully confirmed
6725432 our findings may someday allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages
6725433 chemical biomarkers may eventually serve as objective clinical markers of disease if effective sensor technology can be developed
6725434 los investigadores sospechaban desde hace tiempo que olores emanaban de los tumores pero somos los primeros en identificar y en medir los componentes de estos olores
6725435 este avance abre el camino a nuevos enfoques potenciales para diagnosticar el c ncer de la piel en base a un perfil de olores de la piel que esperamos conducir a diagn sticos m s r pidos y sin muestras

6725456 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6725457 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6725458 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6725459 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6725460 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6725461 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6725462 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6725463 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6725464 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6725465 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6725466 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6725467 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6725468 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6725469 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6725470 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6725471 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6725472 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6725473 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6725474 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6725475 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6725476 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6725477 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6725478 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe

6725491 it is unacceptable that black students should have to put up with blatant racist stereotypes at nus events it is unacceptable that slavery can be treated as a joke
6725492 it is unacceptable that nothing was done about this by the senior nus nec members present and it was only when i was involved that action was taken this only happened because a distressed black student who felt it hadnt been dealt with immediately contacted me
6725493 this whole process took nearly three hours and included me having to contact the nus president incidents of racism should be dealt with immediately
6725494 it goes without saying that nus takes the issues of equal opportunities and safe space very seriously and i am thus determined that the allegations are handled properly
6725495 it is important in both instances that we do not tolerate racism or a failure to deal with it it is however also important that we do not pre judge the outcome of any investigation

6725583 the motor starts charging the battery turning the kinetic energy back to electric energy
6725584 if youre regening it means you used too much energy in the first place

6725645 paying homage to the pulp horror comics and films that inspired generations of gore fans the house of the dead overkill will expose gamers to a brand new fleshy rollercoaster ride of revolting dismemberment

6725669 a total of 15 556 subjects answered the questions on snoring
6725670 these factors may enhance inflammatory processes and thereby alter upper airway anatomy early in life causing an increased susceptibility for adult snoring
6725671 people who snore run an increased risk of early death and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes
6725672 these new findings suggest that further knowledge about the early life environment may contribute to the primary prevention of snoring
6725673 we found that red tide toxins can be metabolized by other species of phytoplankton that holds true for both the brevetoxins that damage members of the animal kingdom and the as yet unknown allelopathic toxins that kill other competing species of algae
6725674 it could be that skeletonema is degrading karenias allelopathic chemicals just like it degrades brevetoxins or it could be that skeletonema is stressing karenia out making it harder to produce allelopathic chemicals
6725675 we found that when we took seawater and added purified brevetoxins to it the live algae didnt suffer much so there must be other chemicals released by the red tide that are toxic to these algae
6725676 what we do know is that this diatom s costatum is able to undermine these toxins produced by the red tide as well as the brevetoxins that are known to kill vertebrate animals like fish and dolphins
6725677 we hope this study will increase awareness among researchers and help raise the bar on how we use wild animals in research
6725678 while wildlife researchers have made some great strides in addressing animal welfare concerns by using minimally obtrusive capture and handling techniques we found that some commonly used procedures still have potential to cause injury change normal behavior or more generally affect health in a negative manner
6725679 this finding warrants more detailed investigation of specific and cumulative effects of other stressors that bears may be exposed to during and after capture for example sample collection marking and carrying radiotransmitters
6725680 this finding is particularly important because as body condition fades so too does an animals potential for growth reproduction and survival
6725681 not only do researchers have a role to play but so do government wildlife agencies and funding agencies in supporting research to improve capture procedures and validate alternative techniques to capture
6725682 the cruze is part of our accelerated focus on more fuel efficient vehicles
6725683 this is a worrying twist as their weaponry becomes more and more sophisticated who knows how many of these rockets are out there
6725684 it turns out that the characteristic behaviour of the nanostructured film allows us to achieve nearly perfect impedance matching over a very broad frequency range
6725685 our nanocoatings can be used to coat optical components for the far infrared such as lenses substrate windows and beam splitters to suppress unwanted internal reflections
6725686 this might help us fine tune the performance of the coating
6725687 of course we then want to coat active terahertz devices and test their performance
6725688 no one can possibly achieve success in the world by conforming to conventional practices and conventional ways of thinking
6725689 it has previously been divided up on a per capita basis but now it will fund smaller projects from 10 000 to 30 000

6725692 coal extraction is not part of the development framework or vision for derwent forest
6725693 the development has immense potential to raise the profile of west cumbria at regional and national level attract inward investment and create jobs and training opportunities which will impact positively on local communities

6725696 the wonderful thing about this is the children are so excited about the olympics and about learning
6725697 its for our social studies unit but it encompasses and emphasizes the three other standards
6725698 they do science because theyre learning fitness of the body they do math when they do their tally board of medals and counting their laps
6725699 this will mean that we can have so many more people volunteering at once and it speaks to the community that we are a real presence here
6725700 this is going to be the official headquarters we have telephones set up and an official office space area we have definite goals we are trying to reach in terms of registering voters and getting more people in the campaign we will be open seven days a week and anyone who would like to come and volunteer would be more than welcome we are looking for more and more volunteers
6725701 its a message of change the fact that he has publicly worked with other people from outside of his party to get things accomplished that is a real sign of change
6725702 we are the grassroots campaign we have actually gone door to door made telephone calls to people and gotten a large number of volunteers
6725703 what we have found is that people like to ask questions and get answers so we are providing them with the answers to their questions people really want to hear the truth
6725704 this is an important area to the senator and to the campaign
6725705 well be working with members of our union to get people registered to vote and make sure they get out to vote with the proper facts not just the slams they hear on tv
6725706 this is bigger we expect to have 15 phone lines going in here its all very well organized this is a great turnout
6725707 ive been trying to help out with the campaign and get senator obama in the white house
6725708 we have had a lot of support and a lot of people coming in to help us out i know that if we can talk to people here and we can talk to them about the issues and what is at stake we really have a chance to do some great things here
6725709 im here to support obama and id like to see more people come together just like we are right now this is wonderful
6725710 this will make us better able to contact people gather people and rally people now that we have a central location we can all come together america needs this change right now and senator obama is presenting the right change
6725711 one becomes two becomes four and becomes eight and i think senator obama has had a marvelous ability to bring people into the political process you see these young energetic people it brings to my mind when i was back in high school and john kennedy was running for president its almost the same thing again as i said when i was speaking earlier these grassroots efforts are becoming more important today than they ever were before
6725712 we are very sorry to her of bettys death they had 20 happy years together up to aws death in january 1991 the society will be represented at her funeral and there is likely to be a memorial service at a later date when i am sure several members will want to attend

6725714 having the boomerang back in kurnell will be a historic symbol of harmony between our two cultures and will help teach young australians about the importance of aboriginal culture
6725715 we often forget how much posture affects how we look and feel as well as how it influences how people perceive us everyone is afraid of developing a pooch or beer belly but we dont realise the role poor posture can play in that
6725716 posture directly affects how tall and thin we look and how confident we appear to others
6725717 but we are all so busy we hardly have time to think about it the iposture is designed to do the thinking for us
6725718 i really think well set a voting record this year just like we did during the primary
6725719 you can look over your ballot and if you want more information on a candidate or issue you can take the time and look it up instead of just making a decision at the polls
6725720 you can have a cup of coffee and vote your ballot from home

6725729 escrts are like the recycling units of the cell they oversee the constant intake break down and replenishing of junctions on the cell surface
6725730 in a cancer cell where escrts are damaged the junctions may not be restored properly this can cause cells to separate and migrate to form secondary tumours in other parts of the body
6725731 previous studies have shown a link between escrts and the loss of junctions in cells of fruit flies so we want to see whether this is also true in humans
6725732 this work should tell us more about the role of escrts in cancer and provide possible new targets for therapy in the future

6725740 people keep asking questions but i have met him only twice and i cant speak about what kind of man he is many people dont know about my connection if people ask about my name i tell them we are not related the problem here is that people have expectations and think i would look after them
6725741 ras proteins exist in all cells anchored to the inside of the cell membrane where they regulate cell growth and cell division the enzyme we are studying helps ras proteins get anchored to the cell membrane by blocking this enzyme we were able to inhibit the binding of ras proteins to cell membranes and greatly improve the disease symptoms in mice with blood cancer
6725742 when we inhibited the production of the enzyme the development of blood cancer declined and the uncontrolled growth of bone marrow cells was blocked another discovery was that normal bone marrow cells were not significantly affected by the icmt enzyme the means that future drugs for inhibiting icmt could specifically target the pathogenic cells and leave normal cells intact a drub that blocks this enzyme could be an effective future cancer treatment
6725743 our model suggests that there is a second cell of air in each hemisphere which is characterised by air rising clouds forming storms developing and other processes associated with moisture in the air occurring in the mid latitudes
6725744 with more attention than ever before being focused on understanding our planets climate weather systems and atmosphere its important that scientists challenge their own assumptions and current theories of how these complex processes work i think our study sheds new light on the driving forces behind the weather in the mid latitudes
6725745 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
6725746 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
6725747 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
6725748 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
6725749 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable
6725750 we are expecting the sample to look similar to previous samples
6725751 one of the things well be looking for now is an oxygen release indicative of perchlorate
6725752 we want to know the structure and composition of the soil at the surface at the ice and in between to help answer questions about the movement of water either as vapor or liquid between the icy layer and the surface

6725754 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
6725755 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavor
6725756 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavor of the resulting oils
6725757 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
6725758 a notable strength of this manuscript is the combined use of structural and evolutionary biology to draw new insights regarding enzyme function these insights led to the striking demonstration that a single amino acid substitution converts one enzyme into another thereby showing how a single point mutation can contribute to the evolution of different biosynthetic pathways this begins to answer the long standing question as to how the same starting molecule can be converted into different products by enzymes that look strikingly similar
6725759 we have discovered that they are also present in marine animals such as sea anemone and corals however we do not know what they do in these organisms

6725762 random processes could promote job sharing in many different types of organisms
6725763 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
6725764 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
6725765 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
6725766 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
6725767 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
6725768 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
6725769 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine
6725770 we are the first to show that you can do this to a single electron in a self assembled quantum dot
6725771 if youre going to do quantum computing you have to be able to work with one electron at a time
6725772 this dark state is a place where information can be stored without any error
6725773 the national security agency has said that based on our present technology we have about a 20 year window of security
6725774 that means if we sent up a satellite today it would take somebody about 20 years to crack the code quantum computers will let you develop a code that would be impossible to crack with a conventional computer
6725775 coherent population trapping of an electron spin in a single negatively charged quantum dot
6725776 the combination of temozolomide using the dose intense schedule and thalidomide at 100 200 mg day is a safe regimen leading to clinical efficacy in patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma most importantly it seems that patients who develop lymphopenia during therapy have a higher chance of obtaining objective response the potential immunologic mechanism behind this will be the subject of future investigations focusing on the potential benefit of regulatory t cell down regulation the correlation between lymphopenia and objective response needs further investigation
6725777 the illusion could be applied to novel displays that change their appearance depending on sound which may be of use in advertising or providing an eye catching multisensory warning or alert in safety critical applications it may also eventually be useful in detecting and diagnosing subtle perceptual differences thought to be characteristic of certain clinical conditions such as dyslexia and autistic spectrum

6725787 yes it wasnt about thinking it was too much or i wasnt capable it was just that when i was playing i was not enjoying it one little bit

6725790 katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray i hate the song it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting
6725791 katy was raised in a very strict christian household she started performing in church at nine she was a special child she loved to sing and had an angelic voice that is why this is all so disappointing and sad
6725792 katy is not a homosexual but i fear she has been led astray by the hollywood crowd
6725793 im sure they opt out of singing i kissed a girl or ur so gay but theyre singing along to every other song on the record theyre just glad im not strung out doing centrefolds and s t like that
6725794 i think gay people have a wonderful sense of humour

6725802 i enjoy coming out here and finding something to make my operation more profitable and meeting more farmers and friends
6725803 i have sheep and am also an electrical contractor this is a good way to find out what other people are doing that maybe youre not doing
6725804 the majority of people who come here are farmers or those who own farming operations and the others are neighbors
6725805 its not just muskingum county weve got people who came from all over like from coshocton licking and morgan counties thats a good thing each year we have about the same amount of people but this year we have more we did things a little different this year by not having any of the equipment dealers which actually didnt hurt the turnout
6725806 we make the program fit the farm we go to
6725807 we were up here in may and thought a presentation on the pros and cons of teff bermuda grass would be good because thats what they grow up here also with the cost of things going up its good to find out the fertility of the soil instead of buying more fertilizer than you need well also have a tiling demonstration and talk about drainage systems and wetland determination
6725808 a lot of folks wonder can you do it and make it pay
6725809 it all depends on if you can get the forage and its worth it if you get extra forage hay is a good source of nutrition and manure is a good source of nitrogen you can buy poultry and hog manures pretty cheap late may and early june is a good time to lay manure on hay fields
6725810 i want people to enjoy it and take the information back to the farm to utilize and improve their operations

6725915 erfreulich ist dass die zust ndigen magistratsbeamtinnen sehr um behindertengerechtigkeit bem ht sind wenig erfreulich dass sie dabei oft auf hindernisse widerst nde und lange wartezeiten sto en und unverst ndlich warum baufirmen einfache normen wie etwa f r handl ufe oder druckkn pfe partout nicht umsetzen
6725916 der rechnungshof bericht best tigt der sololauf von verteidigungsminister darabos bei den vergleichsverhandlungen zum eurofighter vertrag ist kaufm nnisch desastr s und hat der sterreichischen wirtschaft fatalen schaden zugef gt die auswirkungen werden erst sp ter im vollen umfang erkennbar sein aber alleine der rechnungshofbericht zeigt dass durch den darabos alleingang beim vergleich das kompensationsvolumen von rund vier milliarden euro auf 3 5 milliarden euro reduziert wurde damit erwies darabos der sterreichischen wirtschaft einen b rendienst
6725917 die richtlinien des verteidigungsministeriums sehen vor dass f r das wahrnehmen der ressortinteressen bei gegengesch ften im falle einer vertrags nderung zeitgerecht das wirtschaftsministerium zu verst ndigt ist diese mitteilung blieb aber aus
6725918 darabos ist somit seiner amtspflicht nicht nachgekommen und hat mit seiner dilettantischen verhandlungsweise der republik gro en schaden zugef gt wir erhalten nun alte bzw gebrauchte flugzeuge die im st ckpreis teurer sind als neue moderne es gewesen w ren zum anderen f hrt sein unprofessionelles vorgehen zu einem gro en verlust bei den gegengesch ften eine halbe milliarde euro weniger sind ein gro er schaden f r die wirtschaft und gef hrden rund 3 000 arbeitspl tze diese zust nde sind untragbar und von darabos und der sp zu verantworten
6725919 minister darabos reiht sich damit in die lange liste jener sp politiker ein die f r das wirtschaftliche unverst ndnis der sp stehen so wie darabos vorgegangen ist kauft sich ein durchschnittsb rger nicht einmal ein auto niemand mit wirtschaftlichem hausverstand w rde sich ein gebrauchtes auto kaufen das teurer ist als das neuwertige
6725920 wirklich provokante und fehlende ernsthaftigkeit der vp gegen die teuerung etwas zu tun
6725921 bewusstes geringsch tzen des themas das allen sterreichern unter den n geln brennt
6725922 die gralsh ter der wirtschaftspolitik in der vp haben sich v llig versch tzt
6725923 diese steuersenkung ist finanzierbar und w rde entlasten aber nichts wurde unternommen
6725924 diese politik gegen ihre unmittelbaren bed rfnisse mit einer stimme belohnen wollen
6725925 einen halben schritt aber dort wo sie sich bewegt versuchen wir einen konsens zu finden
6725926 es muss nicht sein dass der wahlkampf ein ausnahmezustand ist
6725927 der test ist f r uns eine best tigung der guten rztlichen arbeit bei der vorsorgeuntersuchung eine untersuchung des vereins f r konsumenteninformation erzielt nicht oft so positive ergebnisse wie der vki auch selbst betont wir sind erfreut und sehen das ergebnis als motivationsimpuls
6725928 ows rztin spricht von traumatisierung ihres teams durch verbale attacken der opposition
6725929 in ihrer heutigen aussage hat prim dr margit wrobel vom otto wagner spital von einer gro en betroffenheit und traumatisierung ihrer mitarbeiter durch die diffamierungen und verbale attacken der opposition gesprochen
6725930 dr wrobel hat die engagierte hervorragende arbeit ihres teams hervorgehoben das durch die st ndigen angriffe in den letzten monaten sehr verunsichert und traumatisiert sei
6725931 ein besonderer skandal ist in diesem zusammenhang eine vp brosch re in der ein aufenthalt im ows w rtlich mit dem
6725932 auch dr margit wrobel hat sich ber diese formulierungen entsetzt gezeigt und sie als rufsch digend zur ckgewiesen und sogar als einklagbar bezeichnet
6725933 einzig und allein die vp die menschen verunsichert und die engagierte arbeit im ows bewusst skandalisiert
6725934 allerdings hat auch fr dr wrobel zu bedenken gegeben dass es gerade in der psychiatrie schwierig sei eine eindeutige state of the art behandlung zu definieren weil in diesem bereich sehr viel mit emotionen gearbeitet wird und nicht alle situationen vorhersehbar sind
6725935 das ist auch genau der grund warum wir patientinnen nicht vor die kommission laden wollen weil wir sie davor bewahren m chten dass private und heikle krankengeschichten ffentlich diskutiert werden den betreffenden fall hat im brigen bereits die staatsanwaltschaft untersucht kein fehlverhalten festgestellt und das verfahren eingestellt
6725936 so wird es im ows nach wie vor eingesetzt weil laut wrobel im umgang mit schwierigen patienten manchmal freiheitsbeschr nkende ma nahmen notwendig sind und das netzbett noch ein bestimmtes ma an bewegungsfreiheit bietet dr wrobel h lt aber auch eine grunds tzliche diskussion dar ber f r positiv
6725937 es geht nicht an dass die rote rathausmehrheit auf kosten der b rgerinnen und b rger die geb hrenschraube ber die schmerzgrenze anhebt w hrend die menschen unter der hohen inflation zu leiden haben bereits ber 700 euro j hrliche mehrkosten hat eine wiener durchschnittsfamilie der sp zu verdanken
6725938 die sp hat bereits wissen lassen dass sie dieses geb hrenerh hungsgesetz im rahmen des von der vp verlangten sonderlandtages nicht abschaffen will eine perfidie angesichts der sorgen der wiener
6725939 diese s ndenf lle der ra faymann zeigen das wahre gesicht der sozialdemokraten die maske des roten wien ist ab
6725940 es ist uns wichtig diese verwaltungsvereinfachung auch an unsere t rkischen gastronomen in wien weiterzugeben
6725941 unternehmer mit migrationshintergrund sind nicht nur f r die wiener wirtschaft zu einem enorm wichtigen faktor herangewachsen sie schaffen auch arbeitspl tze und tragen erheblich zum wirtschaftlichen erfolg wiens bei
6725942 wir m ssen diese unternehmer ganz besonders unterst tzen da sie oftmals noch nicht lange im land sind und vor allem die beh rdensprache somit eine gro e h rde darstellt wir haben uns daher als ersten schritt f r die gastronomie ein produkt berlegt das den t rkischen gastronomen ganz konkret hilft und ihnen den umgang mit den beh rden erleichtert
6725943 wenn man sich zehn minuten t glich mit dem goldenen ordner besch ftigt erspart man sich viel rger und zeit der gastronomie club hat in zusammenarbeit mit dem wirtschaftsbund wien in m hevoller arbeit gemeinsam mit den beh rden diesen ordner erstellt um die t gliche verwaltungsarbeit auf ein minimum zu reduzieren
6725944 den goldenen ordner gab es bisher nur in deutscher sprache und wir mussten immer wieder feststellen dass es aufgrund sprachlicher barrieren zu missverst ndnissen kam deshalb haben wir den ordner jetzt auch in t rkischer sprache aufgelegt um die t rkischen kollegen besser unterst tzen zu k nnen
6725945 h upl l sst die mitarbeiterinnen im otto wagner spital seit jahren mit ihren problemen allein und bagatellisiert deren probleme
6725946 wer in einem heuhaufen sitzt und z ndelt darf sich nicht wundern wenn er in rauch aufgeht
6725947 b rgermeister h upl soll durch eine verl ngerungszusage an die verdiente und streitbare rztin sicherstellen dass es nicht mehr l nger zu repressionen gegen kritische rzte im otto wagner spital kommt
6725948 die kav f hrung hat trotz vorangegangener brandunf lle weder f r ausreichende brandschutzma nahmen gen gend personal zur patientinnenbewachung noch f r ausreichende patientenrufanlagen gesorgt obwohl so wrobel in den primar rztesitzungen auf m ngel hingewiesen wurde au erdem hat man zwischen dem ersten brandunfall 2003 und dem schlimmeren 2005 keine abteilungs bergreifende schulung und geeignete technische investitionen vorgenommen diese m ngel musste eine patientin mit schwersten brandverletzungen bezahlen
6725949 r umt der ehemalige eu kommissar zwar ein dass biodiesel mehr emissionen verursacht als er einspart aber das hindert ihn nicht daran kr ftig die werbetrommel f r agrarische treibstoffe zu r hren um den absatz f r die landwirtschaftslobby nicht zu schm lern
6725950 er gibt zu dass die beimischungsziele sterreichs von 20 prozent bis 2020 unhaltbar sind
6725951 er erkl rt sie selbst f r fatal kann sich aber offenbar nicht der parteipolitischen verpflichtung gegen ber dem umweltminister entziehen hoffentlich bleibt alpbach die letzte b hne f r solch unseri se aussagen
6725952 blanker hohn gegen ber hochrangigen expertenteams ist etwas was wir weder in sterreich noch in der umweltpolitik brauchen
6725953 die umweltpolitisch und menschenrechtlich mehr als nur bedenklich ist die sterreicherinnen leiden stark unter den hohen nahrungsmittelpreisen in anderen erdteilen m ssen die menschen deshalb bereits hungern wir brauchen endlich eine neue umweltpolitik in und f r sterreich
6725954 nur ein sektoren branchen und parteien bergreifender paradigmenwechsel in der energiepolitik kann dem gro en potenzial effizienzsteigender ma nahmen zum durchbruch verhelfen wir m ssen hier umfassend neu denken und brauchen einen paradigmenwechsel
6725955 dass es eines echten quantensprungs im bereich der energieeffizienz bedarf um zumindest einen verbrauchsstopp zu erzielen und um die ambitionierten klimaschutzziele auch nur ann hernd erreichen zu k nnen
6725956 gerade wir k nnen und m ssen vor allem technologische antworten auf die dr ngenden fragen des umweltschutzes geben das entspricht dem selbstbild der industrie die sich auch in fragen der energie und klimapolitik als teil der l sung versteht
6725957 unrealistischen prozentzielen im bereich klimaschutz und erneuerbare energie erteilt die sterreichische industrie hingegen eine klare absage
6725958 es gilt daher noch st rker als bisher in forschung und entwicklung zu investieren da neue energie und umwelttechnologien sowohl der heimischen wirtschaft als auch der umwelt n tzlich sind

6725983 raportul dintre costul de dezvoltare teren investitie si pretul de vanzare final a unui metru patrat construit este perceput de catre cumparatorii finali ca fiind prea mare
6725984 una din solutii ar fi constructia de blocuri inalte acolo unde parametrii urbanistici permit acest lucru acestea ar putea servi drept o alternativa destul de interesanta prin reducerea costului inalt de cumparare a terenurilor totusi intrebarea ramane daca producatorii sunt gata sa si scada o parte din profit pentru a obtine un pret final mai accesibil si daca sunt gata sa contribuie la amenajarea infrastructurii din zona respectiva
6725985 ca rezultat numarul de clienti de clasa medie cu un venit oficial in crestere progresiva atat in volum cat si ca valoare nu prea au din ce alege deoarece se orienteaza mai mult spre apartamente cu 2 3 camere sau garsoniere pentru familii tinere decat la apartamente si vile mari

6725989 the august bank holiday is our traditional goodbye to the summer and is always very busy this year is no exception with large numbers escaping to guaranteed sunshine sandy beaches and warm seas
6725990 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6725991 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6725992 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6725993 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6725994 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6725995 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6725996 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6725997 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6725998 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6725999 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6726000 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6726001 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6726002 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6726003 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6726004 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6726005 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6726006 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6726007 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6726008 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6726009 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6726010 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6726011 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6726012 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6726013 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6726014 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6726015 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6726016 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6726017 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6726018 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6726019 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6726020 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6726021 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6726022 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6726023 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6726024 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6726025 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6726026 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6726027 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6726028 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest

6726033 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6726034 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6726035 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6726036 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6726037 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6726038 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6726039 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6726040 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6726041 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6726042 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6726043 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6726044 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6726045 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6726046 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6726047 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6726048 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6726049 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6726050 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6726051 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6726052 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6726053 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6726054 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6726055 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6726056 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6726057 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6726058 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6726059 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6726060 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6726061 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6726062 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6726063 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6726064 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6726065 im not 100 percent or anything but there has been progress made
6726066 hey thats up to him im not the coach i do what im told hopefully i keep getting better and keep getting closer to my goal
6726067 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6726068 this is a planning took where all things are going
6726069 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6726070 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6726071 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6726072 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6726073 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6726074 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6726075 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6726076 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6726077 la ltima liquidaci n de haberes del personal de mantenimiento incluy el pago de guardias al mismo valor con que se liquidan los agentes de la direcci n de transporte 90
6726078 positivamente al personal de mantenimiento haci ndolo cumplir los horarios de guardias establecidos originalmente
6726079 posteriormente y a trav s del director de personal del ministerio gobierno fue solicitada la modificaci n del texto del proyecto de resoluci n para liquidar las guardias efectuadas en el mes de junio pasado al valor establecido en el decreto 1465 07 58
6726080 ante la consideraci n de que la pr xima liquidaci n se efectuar a los antiguos valores sumado al probable descuento de lo liquidado en mayo el personal de mantenimiento ha demostrado nuevamente el des nimo y el desaliento invocando insensibilidad por parte de los funcionarios del gobierno manifestada en la falta de concreci n de lo oportunamente comprometido
6726081 por mi parte debo reiterar que tales circunstancias afectan negativamente el nivel de seguridad del aeropuerto puesto que el personal en lugar de concentrarse nicamente en su labor incorpora a su mente ideas y pensamientos que necesariamente lo distraen de su tarea
6726082 se generan contradicciones en sus modos de acci n debido a los diferentes contextos en que se encuentran cada uno de ellos por ltimo debo reiterar tambi n que el personal jer rquico se ve cada vez m s limitado en las tarea de conducir el aiuma
6726083 uno dei brani pi oscuri ed inquietanti che abbia mai ascoltato dove le chitarre e le tastiere riescono a ricreare il buio e la paura in un modo impeccabile mentre lo scream straziante di ihsahn un vero urlo di disperazione altro che cradle of filth
6726084 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6726085 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6726086 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6726087 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6726088 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6726089 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6726090 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6726091 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6726092 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6726093 ya saya bisa katakan hingga 31 agustus semuanya bisa terjadi presiden ramon calderon menjanjikan robinho pihak klub akan melepasnya bila tawaran dengan nilai 40 juta euro atau 32 juta pounds datang untuknya

6726097 weve entered a period of quite acute weakness thats unlikely to be short lived
6726098 theres a good chance were facing at least two consecutive quarters of negative growth

6726103 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6726104 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6726105 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6726106 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6726107 the troop pullback has been started at a rate to make sure that the russian troops be within the area of responsibility of the russian peacekeeping contingent by the end of 22 august
6726108 we are not going to correct this plan or increase the speed of withdrawal
6726109 if nato fails now to come up with a united response nobodys safe even if they are in nato already
6726110 its all about reconsidering the role of nato the role of international law and borders in this part of the world this is no longer about georgia anymore
6726111 russia decided to win war with nato without firing a single shot at it
6726112 ich finde es superinteressant valencia ist die drittgr te stadt spaniens wirtschaftlich floriert sie sie hat ziemlich viel aufgeholt in den letzten jahren es gibt auch sehr viel tourismus hier die paella kommt aus dieser ecke und viele andere kleinigkeiten es gibt stierkampf hier und auch den ber hmten fu ballklub es gibt schon einiges
6726113 die strecke wird immer schneller und man hat nicht viel zeit um viele nderungen am fahrzeug vorzunehmen also sammelt man informationen man wertet die aus und l sst sie einflie en wenn man sp ter noch mal rausgeht ich bin sicher dass sie die 1 40er zeit knacken und sich weiter verbessern werden
6726114 man braucht mechanischen grip aber hier hat es f r einen stadtkurs auch ein paar schnelle ecken sodass auch die aerodynamik wichtig ist es geht eher richtung melbourne als zu monaco es gibt auch weniger bodenwellen als in monaco und die autos k nnen anscheinend recht tief fahren
6726115 bei den simulationen wird immer der gripfaktor berechnet der ist am anfang etwas geringer denn die strecke ist noch staubig das wird sich im laufe des wochenendes verbessern
6726116 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6726117 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces

6726124 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6726125 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6726126 the russian georgia conflict has disrupted supplies and it looks like it will drag on and create a lot of uncertainty
6726127 a violent education corporal punishment of children in u s public schools
6726128 more than 200 000 u s public school students were punished by beatings during the 2006 2007 school year
6726129 the other kids were watching and laughing it made me want to fight them when you get a paddling and you see everyone laugh at you it make you mad and you want to do something about it
6726130 all corporal punishment whether or not it causes significant physical injury represents a violation of each students rights to physical integrity and human dignity it is degrading and humiliating damaging the students self esteem and making him or her feel helpless
6726131 in the 13 southern states where corporal punishment is most prevalent african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population and african american girls are 2 1 times more likely to be paddled than might be expected

6726170 psychoanalysis unfortunately has hardly anything to say about the derivation of beauty all that seems certain is its derivation from the field of sexual feeling
6726171 the deepest sources of the religious feeling than with what the common man understands by his religion with the system doctrines and promises which on the one hand explains to him the riddles of this world with enviable completeness and on the other assures him that a careful providence will watch over his life and will compensate him in a future existence for any frustrations he suffers here the common man cannot imagine this providence otherwise than in the figure of an enormously exalted father only such a being can understand the needs of the children of men and be softened by their prayers and placated by the signs of their remorse the whole thing is so patently infantile so foreign to reality that to anyone with a friendly attitude to humanity it is painful to think that the great majority of mortals will never be able rise above this view of life
6726172 it is still more humiliating to discover how large a number of people living to day who cannot but see that this religion is not tenable nevertheless try to defend it piece by piece in a series of pitiful rearguard actions one would like to mix among the ranks of the believers in order to meet these philosophers who think they can rescue the god of religion by replacing him by an impersonal shadowy and abstract principle and to address them with the warning words thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain and if some of the great men of the past acted in the same way no appeal can be made to their example we know why they were obliged to

6726178 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately we see those forces now having advanced on to the soil of georgia georgian territorial integrity is in question here
6726179 we did not want to see a recourse to violence and force and we made that very very clear
6726180 the fact that we were trying to convince the georgian side not to take this step is clear evidence that we did not want all this to happen
6726181 we have seen the destruction of civilian infrastructure as well as calls by some russian politicians to change the democratically elected government of georgia some question the territorial integrity of georgia that is why we believe that russia has gone too far

6726183 since the prisoner khodorkovsky had no connection with the professional educational programme offered him in detention he does not deserve conditional early release
6726184 our hopes were based on the comments made by russian president medvedev and his statements about the judicial system being seriously ill riddled with corruption and dependent on political power
6726185 this is a test case and the decision today shows that the gulf between the intentions of the president and the realisation of his intentions has not got any smaller the gulf remains very big
6726186 the judicial system will not be reformed quickly this is something i have known for a long time

6726195 that was three years ago when i went hunting with my wife
6726196 the seal of the confessional can never be broken however i got my first impressions of the parish from the very first confession i heard here i can only hint vaguely about this but when i came here twenty five years ago i thought i had been assigned to a terrible place the very first chap who entered my confessional told me how he had stolen a television set and when stopped by the police had almost murdered the officer further he told me he had stolen money from his parents embezzled money from his place of business had an affair with his bosss wife taken illegal drugs and gave vd to his sister i was appalled but as the days went on i came to realize that my people were not all like that and i had indeed come to a fine parish full of understanding and loving people
6726197 ill never forget the first day our parish priest arrived in this parish
6726198 in fact i had the honor of being the first one to go to him for confession

6726353 it is impossible to separate the political from the commercial aspects of that display
6726354 for example the state argues that frazier can sell his shirts without displaying the soldiers names but fraziers product is his message and his customers message
6726355 experience is the best and simplest way to learn anything that is why it is so valued in the business world
6726356 it defines the corporations character and culture formal and informal networks all the elements that compose the dynamics of an organisation
6726357 in china for example etiquette and attitudes are very different so a successful strategy in europe might fail in china changemasters can reflect these cultural differences
6726358 some people have enormous influence in a corporation or department through their reputation or their informal networks of co workers

6726371 unlike my opponent i can stand on my own two feet and make my own campaign
6726372 i think theres been real negligence on the part of the bush administration and mitch mcconnell to look at forms of energy
6726373 all of a sudden were in the middle of a campaign and theyre like cicadas were getting all this campaign rhetoric and after the election it will be like a normal situation and itll just die away
6726374 barack obama is very unpopular in kentucky if he wants to make president bush the issue we could make barack obama the issue but the truth of the matter is who would be better for kentucky bruce lunsford or mitch mcconnell
6726375 after 24 years in the senate mitch mcconnell has become a multi millionaire guess who paid for that you did
6726376 the total value of contracts won by lawson affiliated companies for which he had the ktc kentucky transportation cabinet engineers estimates during 2006 2007 was approximately 129 969 000

6726434 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
6726435 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
6726436 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6726437 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6726438 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6726439 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6726440 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6726441 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6726442 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home
6726443 to put it plainly t boone pickens is out to save america
6726444 he asked if we could we join together and do something i told him no because global warming is on page two for me
6726445 here we are face to face a couple of silver spoons
6726446 here we are face to face a couple of silver spoons
6726447 a flame should not dance alone it is a sad sight
6726448 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office
6726449 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6726450 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6726451 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6726452 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6726453 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6726454 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6726455 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6726456 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6726457 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6726458 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6726459 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6726460 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6726461 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6726462 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6726463 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6726464 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6726465 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6726466 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6726467 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6726468 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6726469 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6726470 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6726471 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6726472 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6726473 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6726474 national economic trends have now fully impacted the illinois labor market
6726475 while many areas throughout the state continue to experience stable or moderate job growth local economies cannot provide enough opportunities to prevent increases in unemployment induced by national economic uncertainty
6726476 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6726477 i am sure that a number of fans will be coming to south africa some of them will be first time visitors we need to be there to give them an experience and ensure they come back with their families and friends
6726478 tourism sa is in the process of linking 2010 to a range of other tourism experiences throughout the country and the sadc southern african development community region
6726479 travel throughout the region will be relatively easy and seamless we are even in negotiations on a univisa to enable tourists to travel in the region on a single visa

6726482 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6726483 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6726484 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6726485 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6726486 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6726487 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6726488 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6726489 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6726490 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6726491 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6726492 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6726493 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6726494 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6726495 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6726496 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6726497 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6726498 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6726499 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6726500 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6726501 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6726502 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6726503 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6726504 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6726505 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6726506 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6726507 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6726508 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6726509 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6726510 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6726511 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6726512 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6726513 the fundamental basis of this nations laws was given to moses on the mount the fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from exodus and st matthew from isaiah and st paul
6726514 i dont think we emphasize that enough these days if we dont have a proper fundamental moral background we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state
6726515 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
6726516 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6726517 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6726518 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6726519 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6726520 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6726521 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6726522 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6726523 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6726524 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6726525 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6726526 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6726527 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6726528 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6726529 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6726530 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6726531 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6726532 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6726533 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6726534 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6726535 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6726536 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6726537 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6726538 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6726539 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6726540 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6726541 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6726542 its the only dry way to get around its not like you can go jogging or anything
6726543 this storm has been hanging around and hanging around and hanging around
6726544 and shes going to be around for a while longer
6726545 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6726546 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6726547 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6726548 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6726549 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6726550 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6726551 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6726552 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6726553 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6726554 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6726555 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6726556 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6726557 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6726558 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6726559 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6726560 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6726561 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6726562 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6726563 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6726564 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6726565 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6726566 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6726567 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6726568 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6726569 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6726570 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6726571 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6726572 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6726573 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6726574 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6726575 no trippin we just have to stop dumping raw feces and piss into the ocean simple
6726576 i didnt know what to expect some kind of moonscape perhaps but it was incredible huge matrices of branching porites coral up to 8 meters 25 feet high had established creating a thriving coral reef habitat
6726577 throughout other parts of the lagoon it was awesome to see coral cover as high as 80 percent and large tree like branching coral formations with trunks 30 centimeters 12 inches thick
6726578 it seems like you won approval from all who write bs on every subject every day the know it alls stay true to yourself never change to please others or to fit in
6726579 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6726580 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6726581 we tried to play a high tempo from the start
6726582 thats always part of the plan we tried to start well we knew tipp would come back into it but all year we havent been panicking which is a good sign for the team
6726583 wed played well in the first quarter of an hour but then we slackened off we knew what we had to do there was no panicking
6726584 waterford are a class side we knew that coming up and nobody would begrudge them where theyre at if theres been a team of the last five six years its waterford
6726585 after losing five semi finals i suppose we had to get one right at some stage thankfully at the final whistle we werent crying into the jerseys well enjoy the next few days and go back training tuesday or wednesday
6726586 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6726587 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6726588 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6726589 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6726590 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6726591 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
6726592 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6726593 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6726594 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6726595 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6726596 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6726597 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6726598 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6726599 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6726600 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6726601 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6726602 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6726603 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6726604 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6726605 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6726606 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6726607 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6726608 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6726609 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6726610 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6726611 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6726612 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6726613 in questo periodo la mia vita piena ho tante cose intorno a me che mi piacciono che mi affascinano sto molto bene da solo la mia vita senza d te meravigliosa
6726614 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6726615 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6726616 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6726617 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6726618 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6726619 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6726620 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6726621 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6726622 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6726623 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6726624 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6726625 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6726626 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6726627 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6726628 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6726629 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6726630 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6726631 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6726632 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6726633 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6726634 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6726635 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6726636 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6726637 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6726638 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6726639 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6726640 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6726641 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6726642 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6726643 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6726644 hei ho le tubature rotte piango a go go e non mi interessa
6726645 todas as conseq ncias desta s mula ter o de ser testadas no dia a dia porque a realidade f tica multifacetada
6726646 certamente vamos receber reclama es quando poderemos esclarecer as d vidas refor ou o presidente do stf ministro gilmar mendes mas a experi ncia indica que havendo seguran a jur dica que se cumpra a decis o sem pestanejar
6726647 perspektive 50plus besch ftigungspakte f r ltere in den regionen
6726648 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6726649 they told me there are going to be resources here
6726650 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6726651 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6726652 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6726653 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6726654 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6726655 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6726656 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6726657 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6726658 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6726659 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6726660 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6726661 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6726662 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6726663 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6726664 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6726665 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6726666 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6726667 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6726668 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6726669 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6726670 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6726671 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6726672 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6726673 a considerable chunk of the surplus money in the hands of the government employees will be invested in fixed deposits shares and mutual funds but most of them are likely to choose investing through mutual funds as the option offers a safe and easier method of investing
6726674 every government employee can find suitable schemes for him her and their family from our kitty of products
6726675 we will mostly use systematic investment plan as a tool to attract government employees it is the safest bet for them who are quite scared of taking greater risk in a volatile market
6726676 it is the responsibility of amcs to convince such investors by intensifying the awareness level on the benefits of mutual fund investments the 6th pay commission has given an opportunity for all fund houses to enhance their geographical reach as government employees are spread at every nook and corner of india
6726677 the mutual fund industry will benefit from salary hikes this will happen primarily because some part of the increased disposable income would be circulated back as savings there would be a tendency to invest in superior investment avenues like mutual funds as well
6726678 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6726679 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6726680 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6726681 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6726682 it remains to be seen how the shopping malls of america might evolve over time the conditions under which they flourish cheap gasoline cars for everyone a credit driven consumer economy special tax breaks for big real estate ventures may be viewed as abnormal and transitory a fragile equation that could fall apart like a house of cars if any of the factors change for example if gasoline prices go up enough to erase the profit margins of mass retailers or if citizens have to establish credit worthiness before banks issue them charge cards or if more banks themselves fail only one thing is for certain the malls will not be new forever
6726683 ser quase quatro horas de m sica sem parar igual queles shows de forr que rolam por a
6726684 fizemos uma enquete na internet para saber quais m sicas o p blico queria mais que fossem tocadas e a set list foi feita a partir disso
6726685 vamos tocar duas m sicas minhas duas deles e como n o poderia deixar de ser uma do rei roberto carlos
6726686 al m da proposta ser diferente teremos mais pessoas no palco do que na del rey

6726688 we know that the industry is facing these acute challenges and i cant say with any certainty that there wont be further announcements in regard to job losses
6726689 la spesa estiva di italiani e stranieri in cantine malghe o frantoi supera il miliardo
6726690 lacquisto di un alimento direttamente dal produttore e unoccasione per conoscere non solo il prodotto ma anche la storia la cultura e le tradizione in molti casi la vendita e accompagnata anche dalla possibilita di assaggi e degustazioni guidate che consente di fare una scelta consapevole difficilmente possibile altrove ma anche di verificare personalmente i processi produttivi in un ambiente naturale tipico della campagna
6726691 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6726692 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6726693 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6726694 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6726695 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6726696 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6726697 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6726698 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6726699 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6726700 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6726701 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6726702 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6726703 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6726704 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6726705 if a representative is not here a witness summons will be issued
6726706 it is unacceptable that a juvenile is in the custody of the state yet the state is unwilling to assess him
6726707 the hse in castleknock have an onus and a responsibility to assess him he was an existing patient of theirs before this
6726708 i am told that the psychiatric services are refusing to assess him because he is not in a therapeutic environment i said we were not looking for an assessment not therapy

6726721 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west

6726724 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful

6726731 whilst it may come as a relief to the local community that the statues have been returned i would still condemn the behaviour of those responsible for removing it

6726733 there is always interest i cannot tell you much more hes one of the players we are following i find barry a good player

6726735 at the moment the liverpool situation means he is not at his best that is my opinion
6726736 it is unacceptable that black students should have to put up with blatant racist stereotypes at nus events it is unacceptable that slavery can be treated as a joke
6726737 it is unacceptable that nothing was done about this by the senior nus nec members present and it was only when i was involved that action was taken this only happened because a distressed black student who felt it hadnt been dealt with immediately contacted me
6726738 this whole process took nearly three hours and included me having to contact the nus president incidents of racism should be dealt with immediately
6726739 it goes without saying that nus takes the issues of equal opportunities and safe space very seriously and i am thus determined that the allegations are handled properly
6726740 it is important in both instances that we do not tolerate racism or a failure to deal with it it is however also important that we do not pre judge the outcome of any investigation

6726753 after the concert joel invited her back to see the tour bus he showed her some baby photos of harlow joel isnt one to lie or hide things from nicole so the next day he told her about it on the phone nicole freaked out joel thought shed respect the fact that he was trying to be honest after all he and mary kate are just friends but nicole was hurt and angry he couldnt deal with it so he hung up and she kept texting him after that

6726759 they feel like theyre making good progress they dont have a hard timeline to share on when that will be complete but its important to bring it back up to operations as safely and quickly as we can
6726760 we were able to get through last weekend with some temporary runouts weve decided that were better off to temporarily close a small number of stations
6726761 were not able to make up all the volumes that we would like to but the fact that we have these contracts in place has given us more flexibility than we would otherwise have if we were only dealing with petro canada
6726762 at this point we are counting on petro canada to have their processing unit back up within a reasonable time so that these closures will be temporary we have not made any decisions beyond that
6726763 you might see an impact if you had numerous refineries with an issue like this but so far i dont think that weve noticed any effect on the price
6726764 its great if youre a refinery because it blocks competition and helps you keep our prices up
6726765 but its not good for consumers and at times like this its not good for our operations either because we cant get any gas

6726772 this is a terrific basis from which to be proceeding and that is the success that we have achieved
6726773 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation were talking about an agreement that is going to build a firm foundation for building on the significant success that weve had together in the last year and it gives more and more responsibility to iraqi forces there are provinces here in which iraqi forces are completely in control they are by themselves there will be more of those and so this agreement is based on success
6726774 there has been a great deal of progress in fact secretary rices meeting this morning with the prime minister was positive and we are very close to finalize this important agreement for iraq for the region and for the friendship and the partnership of iraq and the united states

6726786 thousands of ordinary people like me tried to do what they were told by the government and save sensibly for retirement only to lose large amounts of their hard earned savings
6726787 a cruel deception we were led to believe we were saving for our retirement in a blue chip provider of the highest integrity we took comfort from the words regulated by the dti treasury and fsa those words obviously meant nothing at all
6726788 new approach is very well and the plan now is to run on saturday

6726792 but i think it would be very wrong of her when shes on an official job to be dressed too casually shes always got to be a bit above
6726793 she has a way of dressing that cuts across ethnic color and class lines

6726797 its been a long time coming this olympic gold i have worked very hard for it over the last 15 years and this is what i have been working flat out for over the last four years since athens
6726798 it was a perfect race in training you do race practice you learn how to race hard and how you are going to do your splits and where you are going to do your pick ups so really it is just executing what you do in training everyday
6726799 im really looking forward to that im just going to get flushed out properly today i got out of my boat after the final and i havent back in it since ill go back out for a paddle now and then refocus and hope it all goes well tomorrow
6726800 its amazing i have been watching most of those gold medal winners on the television

6726814 keep your eye on that building itll be coming down soon
6726815 the first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building
6726816 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
6726817 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused
6726818 there are holes in this story that you can drive a truck through
6726819 dr steven jones found it in the dust that landed in the entire area of lower manhattan and he finds it in the chunks of previously molten metal from the towers
6726820 nist said that wtc 7 fell at 40 slower than free fall speed but it collapsed a lot faster than it would have if the structural supports were not all blown away at the same instant 40 slower isnt very impressive thats like arguing that a rock falling through concrete 40 slower than a rock falling through the air is perfectly normal
6726821 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
6726822 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
6726823 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
6726824 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
6726825 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause

6726828 give the money back to the people who need it most
6726829 theres an investigation pending into the allegations against mr freeman
6726830 whether the union wants to give the money back is clearly up to the union
6726831 that the charges began to be implemented in october the same month ridley thomas announced his candidacy for county supervisor
6726832 mark has for more than a decade been one of long term care workers greatest allies
6726833 when i first arrived in the senate that first year we had a situation surrounding terri schiavo and i remember how we adjourned with a unanimous agreement that eventually allowed congress to interject itself into that decision making process of the families

6726844 sell products that contain the claim of being politically progressive acts in and of themselves
6726845 the infinite adaptability of capitalism which in the case of an acute ecological catastrophe or crisis can easily turn ecology into a new field of capitalist investment and competition
6726846 todays predominant mode of politics is post political bio politics
6726847 it is very hard to get used to the idea that the catastrophe far from being imminent has already taken place
6726848 to dare to confront the vertiginous cosmos so as to make it inhabitable
6726849 the basic trust in the background coordinates of our world
6726850 guarantee the harmony between the levels to guarantee that the overall interactions will be satisfactory
6726851 and the lesson of ecology is that we should go to the end here and accept the non existence of the ultimate big other nature itself with its pattern of regular rhythms the ultimate reference of order and stability
6726852 a society governed not by the search for profit but by peoples genuine needs and the requirements of socio ecological sustainability

6726858 they really are coming up with some corkers at syndicalist central at the moment
6726859 few other literary forms have so brazenly affirmed themselves as argument and counterargument
6726860 it seemed very fresh to me i mean that part where you say how the first industrial revolution devalued muscle work then the second one devalued routine mental work i was fascinated
6726861 nobert wiener a mathematician said all that way back in the nineteen forties its fresh to you because youre too young to know anything but the way things are now
6726862 actually it is kind of incredible that things were ever any other way isnt it it was so ridiculous to have people stuck in one place all day just using their senses then a reflex using their senses then a reflex and not really thinking at all
6726863 to the people who were going to be replaced by machines maybe a third one eh in a way i guess the third ones been going on for some time if you mean thinking machines that would be the third revolution i guess machines that devaluate human thinking some of the big computers like epicac do that all right in specialized fields
6726864 all i can do is to record as best i may with my poor human powers something of the visions strange and tumultuous after effect on my own cosmical imagination when the intolerable lucidity had already blinded me and i gropingly strove to recollect what it was that had appeared for in my blindness the vision did evoke from my stricken mind a fantastic reflex of itself an echo a symbol a myth a crazy dream contemptibly crude and falsifying yet as i believe not wholly without significance
6726865 and now as through tears of compassion and hot protest i seemed to see the spirit of the utlimate and perfected cosmos face her maker in her it seemed compassion and indignation were subdued by praise and the star maker that dark power and lucid intelligence found in the concrete loveliness of his creature the fulfilment of desire and in the mutual joy of the star maker and the ultimate cosmos was conceived most strangely the absolute spirit itself in which all times are present and all being is comprised for the spirit which was the issue of this union confronted my reeling intelligence as being at once the ground and the issue of all temporal and finite things but to me this mystical and remote perfection was nothing in pity of the ultimate tortured beings in humane shame and rage i scorned my birthright of ecstasy in that inhuman perfection and yearned back to my lowly cosmos to my own human and floundering world there to stand shoulder to shoulder with my own half animal kind against the powers of darkness yes and against the indifferent the ruthless the invincible tyrant whose mere thoughts are sentient and tortured worlds then in the very act of this defiant gesture as i slammed and bolted the door of the little dark cell of my separate self my walls were all shattered and crushed inwards by the pressure of irresistable light and my naked vision was once more seared by lucidity beyond its endurance
6726866 it was with anguish and horror and yet with acquiescence even with praise that i felt or seemed to feel something of the eternal spirits temper as it apprehended in one intuitive and timeless vision all our lives here was no pity no proffer of salvation no kindly aid or here were all pity and all love but mastered by a frosty ecstasy our broken lives our loves our follies our betrayals our forlorn and gallant defences were one and all calmly anatomized assessed and placed true they were one and all lived through with complete understanding with insight and full sympathy even with passion but sympathy was not ultimate in the temper of the eternal spirit contemplation was

6726885 the kind of imagination that now manifests itself in science fiction is not something new homer shakespeare and milton all invented new worlds to comment on this one the split of science fiction into a separate and somewhat disreputable genre is a recent development it is connected with the near disappearance of dramatic and philosophical poetry and the slow shrinking of the traditional novel as it concerns itself more and more exclusively with the nuances of human relationships among those areas neglected by the traditional novel are above all the dynamics of human societies the traditional novel tends to depict society as static and mans place in the universe however crudely or naively science fiction at least attempts to place a philosophical and metaphysical frame around the most important events within our lives and consciousness in the past we have always assumed that the external world around us has represented reality however confusing or uncertain and that the inner world of our minds its dreams hopes ambitions represented the realm of fantasy and the imagination these roles too it seems to me have been reversed the most prudent and effective method of dealing with the world around us is to assume that it is a complete fiction conversely the one small node of reality left to us is inside our own heads freuds classic distinction between the latent and manifest content of the dream between the apparent and the real now needs to be applied to the external world of so called reality i feel myself that the writers role his authority and license to act has changed radically i feel that in a sense the writer knows nothing any longer he has no moral stance he offers the reader the contents of his own head he offers a set of options and imaginative alternatives his role is that of the scientist whether on safari or in his laboratory faced with a completely unknown terrain or subject all he can do is to devise hypotheses and test them against the facts
6726886 well i thought that writing about the world today as i perceive it would probably be more challenging in the real sense of science fiction than continuing just to make things up if im going to write fiction set in an imaginary future now im going to need a yardstick that gives me some accurate sense of how weird things are now
6726887 to remain within the sphere of literature we need only remind ourselves of what paul lafargue has to say about marxs evaluation of balzac balzac was not just the chronicler of his own society he was also the creator of prophetic figures who were still embryonic under louis philippe and who only emerged fully grown after his death under napoleon iii but is this marxian view still valid in the present of course it is such prophetic figures however are to be found exclusively in the works of the important realists there is nothing mysterious or paradoxical about any of this it is the very essence of all authentic realism of any importance since such realism must be concerned with the creation of types this has always been the case from don quixote down to oblomov and the realists of our own time the realist must seek out the lasting features in people in their relations with each other and in the situations in which they have to act he must focus on those elements which endure over long periods and which constitute the objective human tendencies of society and indeed of mankind as a whole such writers form the authentic ideological avant garde since they depict the vital but not immediately obvious forces at work in objective reality they do so with such profundity and truth that the products of their imagination receive confirmation from subsequent events not merely in the simple sense in which a successful photograph mirrors the original but because they express the wealth and diversity of reality reflecting forces as yet submerged beneath the surface which only blossom forth visibly to all at a later stage great realism therefore does not portray an immediately obvious aspect of reality but one which is permanent and objectively more significant namely man in the whole range of his relations to the real world above all those which outlast mere fashion over and above that it captures tendencies of development that only exist incipiently and so have not yet had the opportunity to unfold their entire human and social potential to discern and give shape to such underground trends is the great historical mission of the true literary avant garde so what really matters is not the subjective belief however sincere that one belongs to the avant garde and is eager to march in the forefront of literary developments nor is it essential to have been the first to discover some technical innovation however dazzling what counts is the social and human content of the avant garde the breadth the profundity and the truth of the ideas that have been prophetically anticipated in short what is at issue here is not whether or not we deny the possibility of anticipatory movements in the superstructure the vital questions are what was anticipated in what manner and by whom

6726895 one antagonist appeared as the will to dare for the sake of the new the longed for the reasonable and joyful world in which every man and woman may have scope to live fully and live in service of mankind the other seemed essentially the myopic fear of the unknown or was it more sinister was the cunning will for private mastery which fomented for its own ends the archaic reason hating and vindictive passion of the tribe it seemed that in the coming storm all the dearest things must be destroyed all private happiness all loving all creative work in art science and philosophy all intellectual scrutiny and speculative imagination and all creative social building all indeed that man should normally live for seemed folly and mockery and mere self indulgence in the presence of public calamity but if we failed to preserve them when would they live again

6726914 the trauma suffered by everyone in the middle of the 20th century when it became clear that from now on to the end of human history every person would spend his individual life under the threat not only of individual death which is certain but of something almost insupportable psychologically collective incineration and extinction which could come at any time virtually without warning
6726915 perhaps if we have a terrible privilege it is merely that we are alive and are going to die all at once or one at a time
6726916 what protects us is that in nuclear war the event is likely to eliminate the possibility of the spectacle this is why it will not take place for humanity can accept physical annihilation but cannot agree to sacrifice the spectacle unless it can find a spectator in another world

6726920 hectic lifestyles and long working hours means brits are now going to bed later than ever before
6726921 trying to unwind at the end of the day can be difficult when you feel pressure to do chores in the home cook dinner exercise or catch up with loved ones

6726928 we often forget how much posture affects how we look and feel as well as how it influences how people perceive us everyone is afraid of developing a pooch or beer belly but we dont realise the role poor posture can play in that
6726929 posture directly affects how tall and thin we look and how confident we appear to others
6726930 but we are all so busy we hardly have time to think about it the iposture is designed to do the thinking for us

6726935 high energy prices have led to an increase in biodiesel production which in turn has led to an increase in the amount of crude glycerol in the market
6726936 we have shown that it is possible to use the crude glycerol byproduct from the biodiesel industry as a carbon source for microalgae that produce omega 3 fatty acids after thorough chemical analysis we have also shown that the algae biomass composition has the same quality as the commercial algae product
6726937 the results so far have been promising the fish fed the algae had significant amounts of omega 3 fatty acids

6726942 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
6726943 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
6726944 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
6726945 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
6726946 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
6726947 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy

6726962 then jesus said to his disciples if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will find it
6726963 just as i am without one plea but that thy blood was shed for me and that thou bidst me come to thee o lamb of god i come i come
6726964 just as i am and waiting not to rid my soul of one dark blot to thee whose blood can cleanse each spot o lamb of god i come i come
6726965 my heavenly father knows and he alone what it is day after day and hour after hour to fight against bodily feelings of almost overpowering weakness and langour and exhaustion to resolve as he enables me to do not to yield to slothfulness the depression the irritability such as a body causes me to long to indulge but to rise every morning determined on taking this my motto if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me
6726966 but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness therefore i will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses so that christs power may rest on me that is why for christs sake i delight in weaknesses in insults in hardships in persecutions in difficulties for when i am weak then i am strong
6726967 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls
6726968 just as i am though tossed about with many a conflict many a doubt fightings and fears within without o lamb of god i come i come
6726969 just as i am poor wretched blind sight riches healing of the mind yea all i need in thee to find o lamb of god i come i come

6726988 one thing that she did was to make us aware that we couldnt just sit in our comfortable morningside location and assume that in morningside everybodys all right she made us very aware of the people who were not all right people who had problems who had disabilities people who needed help
6726989 she was just amazing its a tremendous loss for the community she was absolutely tireless in fighting for the rights of people who werent very good at fighting for their own rights
6726990 she was constantly available on the phone for other people and i think thats one of the things that people who remember susie remember most her constant availability to let people have their moans and their laughs and cries together
6726991 she would talk to anybody she loved listening to people
6726992 considering her disabilities she was incredible she was a very strong minded person
6726993 demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6726994 i will be making a submission to the court that this was a conviction obtained in the most appalling of circumstances
6726995 my client feels it was an unfair trial and a travesty of justice
6726996 we need to inquire whether this conviction should be recognised by this court
6726997 far far below what is acceptable in western european standards
6726998 therefore i decline to make an interim order as mr gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6726999 mr gadd is pleased to be back in this country
6727000 the last few days as you know he has been travelling around asia and that time was not wasted
6727001 it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival
6727002 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into plan a proper procedure for his protection and his well being
6727003 mr gadd is pleased to be back for another reason because there is the possibility that for the first time he can appear before a court of justice
6727004 he tells me that his trial in vietnam a country which has been condemned by virtually every organisation concerned with justice and human rights as being a system of unfair justice and political trials that his trial in vietnam was a charade was a travesty of justice he never got a fair trial
6727005 in light of the federal intelligence act surveillance amendment act of 2008
6727006 we are satisfied that the settlement is fair to both parties and are ready to put this one behind us

6727042 theres a big difference between being a mom and playing one on the internet
6727043 my kids are not getting well rounded organic meals and my toddler watches a fair share of television
6727044 my interest in the beginning was to reclaim my bad motherhood myself
6727045 i began motherhood thinking i would be stellar at it that i would be an alpha mom reading in multiple languages for a baby but the reality is youre too tired for that
6727046 when i was growing up your mom could turn you loose and you can go outside and play now everything is so organized and kids have so many activities

6727050 it came down to a discussion about busting mom stereotypes and lifting the veil on the realities of motherhood through blogging

6727055 it doesnt matter if it is the olympics the world championships or the european championships the feeling is the same i see no difference between my competitors whether they come from the united states or new zealand
6727056 i was just trying to take the gate and come out first i just raced my race and it came out for the best
6727057 im still young i have plans for the future and i have a lot more to accomplish
6727058 this olympic gold is only one step in my career
6727059 we are all blessed to be here and we did the best as we could
6727060 everyone out there had a chance to win the gold
6727061 it can bring more kids and viewers of the olympics to the sport
6727062 the sport is pretty awesome and we could work as role models for kids
6727063 i think bmx is on the more extreme side of things people dont expect a thing like it in the olympics were opening the door for more extreme stuff paving the way progression
6727064 maybe at times i am a bit too honest and at club level the manager is telling me not to defend too much to try and save some energy for when we are attacking
6727065 but sometimes you just want to win the ball back and work hard for the team that is just how i play maybe it does affect my goals tally but hopefully i can learn and get better
6727066 thousands of ordinary people like me tried to do what they were told by the government and save sensibly for retirement only to lose large amounts of their hard earned savings

6727075 it was good to see them in action and obviously the likes of rowly and hogan are in my thoughts ahead of the doncaster game
6727076 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6727077 while he is still here he is very much 100 a tottenham player that is how we consider things
6727078 ive come here for the chance to play regular football but i dont expect to walk into the side
6727079 i watched last weeks game against spurs from the stands and i was very impressed ive seen david wheater play for middlesbrough before and for the england under 21s and i know that hes a fantastic defender hes a great centre back but he showed that he can play just as well at right back
6727080 you have to have competition for places it was the same at arsenal i hope to get the nod at middlesbrough but i know i will have to fight for my place because the players in the team at the moment want to stay there
6727081 i would argue that if you are making more than 250 000 then you are in the top three four percent of this country
6727082 i think that rich is should be defined by a home a good job and education and the ability to hand our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one we inherited

6727084 obama did his best to reflect the complexity of his tax policy noting his plan would add a new social security payroll tax to incomes over 250 000
6727085 mccain dismissed differences between rich and poor as class warfare a fairly standard republican position
6727086 the obama plan would reduce taxes for low and moderate income families but raise them significantly for high bracket taxpayers
6727087 i define rich in other ways besides income some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them others are poor if theyre billionaires

6727089 the florida department of transportation fdot plans to open a new ramp from eastbound interstate 4 to downtown orlando during the early morning hours of friday aug 22 although weather conditions resulting from tropical storm fay may delay the opening to as late as wednesday aug 27 the new ramp is a gateway to the heart of downtown orlando at garland avenue and south street allowing easier access to existing and future downtown businesses residences and cultural venues drivers on eastbound i 4 will reach the new exit ramp about a half mile sooner than the existing temporary left exit ramp to south street exit 82c when the new ramp opens the left exit ramp closes permanently the new exit 82b is located just after the sr 408 exit the city of orlando held a dedication ceremony to celebrate completion of the new ramp aug 21 at 10 a m before the ramp officially opens to the public the dedication ceremony was held on the ramp just south of south street participants included fdot district five secretary noranne downs orange county mayor richard crotty orlando mayor buddy dyer and orlando economic development department director frank billingsley several members of the church street merchants association were also on hand for the event

6727093 these numbers will assist us as we head into the recovery phase of our operations
6727094 we want to ensure that we get an accurate assessment of the damages that have occurred so our residents can receive the assistance they need to recover
6727095 nearly all of our 67 counties will have been impacted by the time fay leaves our state and these funds will help our local and state partners recoup the costs of keeping floridians safe
6727096 the expectation is fay will continue to spread this 8 to 15 inches of rainfall along all of the interstate 10 corridor
6727097 its moving at a very slow rate of speed and that slow rate of speed is going to continue right through the weekend

6727107 i have to go away to leave this insanity to drift and fall in space because i cannot cope anymore what started as pleasure has now become a desperation that i cannot control i called on you for help i now realise that you did not understand how was i to know that you could not give me the hand that i so longed for i wanted your gentle hand in mine you did not realise that this was my only hope those years have gone all that time squandered i sometimes wonder if love has ever been in my heart would i recognise the love that is supposed to give meaning to our poor ways on earth tonight my soul feels dead and for a brief moment peace washes over me i swim but do not feel the water on my body i cannot taste the salt in my mouth the darkened shoreline by moonlight and a million startled stars that peer out from behind the black velvet cloud what sadness this heartache it brings no respite only the laughing insanity of hopelessness at the doorway
6727108 tonight i wonder what you are doing whether i am in your thoughts do you like me look at the distant sky and feel the pitiful sorrow that wraps itself around you and fills each sober moment with guilt do the tears of this loneliness and separation warm your cheeks in the coldness of night when you sleep do you feel my soft and gentle love embrace you do you miss me i will never know i burn i pant for you you are the end of my grief
6727109 for myself there is no way that i can see everywhere i turn there is a dark corner that beckons me towards it at times i feel strong and try to shake off the self pity and for a few brief moments i am free then i feel the strength slowly leaving my body it starts innocuously what seem harmless signs small flickering indications begin to take control of my body i start to loose my control ever so slightly to begin with my nose begins to dribble a little a cold shudder tip toes down my spine the crunch of heavy boots on breaking ice frosty breath steams in a cold room i am naked my body is starting to ache the blanket of warmth falls to the ground oh please
6727110 to night i cannot sleep i dont think that i can i cannot eat thoughts swirl round my head i have sat in this sparse cottage for too long my muscles twitch no control i dread the finish of my heroin fear grips me oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck i start to cry i cry and cry holding my aching sides it seems that no matter where i go or what i do there will always be this period to contend with these withdrawal symptoms waiting crawling nagging aches and coldness that flow down your body and make you cry with panic oh please sweat pours from my body and soaks my clothing and yet i feel so cold
6727111 eat your dinner and dont worry everything will be all right he will see you soon enough
6727112 tonight i think of you in sleep wrapped up warm and secure in dreams of love and merriment i see you holding each others tiny hands walking across beautiful green meadows filled with the colour and beauty of a scented spring take care my lovelies i miss you both so much there is no moment that escapes me whereby i do not think of you your simplicity that fills my heart and your silly sausage songs they haunt me now in my loneliness all of this i feel and my heart aches i want your arms around me now i want to smell you i want your fundamental sanity in my life if you come i will be safe
6727113 we was just gointer scarper when along comes bill arper so we never done nuffin at all
6727114 it is now that i feel so strong now i know i can kick the habit all i have to do is sweat it out for a few days and then i will be all right i could come home again strong and clean and fresh and alive with a thousand ideas in my head we could love and hold each other and the children would be so happy and i could love again i can feel you in my arms already down by the river the children could play and in those brief moments of being together we could hold each other and i could smell your slightly scented hair and whisper words of sweetest love i would read to you from my book
6727115 even now i love long black eyes that caress like silk ever and ever sad and laughing eyes whose lids make such sweet shadow when they close it seems another beautiful look of hers i love a fresh mouth ah a scented mouth and curving hair subtle as smoke and light fingers and laughter of green gems
6727116 strength i can do it i can return to you soon oh the happiness that i feel at this moment im crying im crying with happiness
6727117 it is a shame since youre an active blogger and what you write has a certain kind of a standard that is worth more readers than you currently have
6727118 especially suitable for the players out there who are still undecided in purchasing the final product
6727119 weve had a good old ding dong off the lizard and going nowhere for the day but really enjoying it the boat is fantastic and we are slowly getting our sea legs its a shame we have had the wind on the nose all the time as we havent been able to see her at her best tide just turned foul so decided to pop into helford for the night and as you can see from the picture the sun has just come out and we have been able to go off the wind with everything up and i cant tell you how nice it is
6727120 long ago helford village was quite an important port this is difficult to believe today as one approaches the sleepy little place on the banks ofthe helford river trading ships once brought french rum tobacco and lace from the continent and the duty was collected at the old custom house during the napoleonic wars pirates and free traders populated the reaches of the river daphne du mauriers novel frenchmans creek tells the story of one of these this was her only romantic novel this could have something to do with the fact that she spent her honeymoon there

6727122 with more than a quarter of the u s gross national product over 2 trillion sensitive to weather and climate events these events substantially impact our national health safety economy environment transportation systems and military readiness
6727123 all 50 states are impacted by these events and many of these events will be exacerbated by climate change
6727124 our concern is that our nation is not prepared for severe weather or climate change because of declining budgets and lack of attention to these threats over the past few years
6727125 we should improve our ability to respond to severe weather events and prepare for the impacts of climate change that will undoubtedly occur over the next several decades decision makers need information on how climate change will affect their local areas but we are hampered by a lack of funding observations and computing power to provide information at this local level
6727126 making our nation resilient to severe weather and climate change
6727127 given the costs of weather and climate disasters we believe these are wise and critical investments
6727128 the significance of our study is that it identifies smurf1 as the signaling partner through which tnf does damage in ra related bone loss
6727129 that has enabled researchers to begin designing small molecule drugs to shut down the action of smurf 1 and its relatives furthermore since mice engineered to have less smurf1 expression develop thicker bones future drugs that shut down smurf1 may be also useful against more common forms of osteoporosis simply by changing the dose of course this is early stage work with many obstacles ahead but it is exciting nonetheless
6727130 our over all hypothesis is that in inflammatory diseases like ra the function of a group of enzymes like smurf1 gets turned on to cause proteasome degradation of key regulator proteins leading to bone loss
6727131 the real future solution will involve a treatment that specifically addresses each of these

6727137 it looks like this dell mp3 player is backed by some pretty smart minds though i think it will fail nothing has really put a dent in apples market share and their have been some attempts that havent gone so well a k a the zune
6727138 when the only embodiment of this grand scheme is a story that was planted in the wall street journal and a story in businessweek anything is possible
6727139 the reality of it is dell has some really cool software in zing the middleware so thats promising but running an online music or media store is not like selling printers or notebooks or pcs at the lowest possible price but maybe im wrong maybe it doesnt matter about the experience and songs are just commodities for the people who pay for them
6727140 certainly apple could use some real competition but it would seem to me to be an extremely steep uphill battle that will be very expensive but then again i dont know
6727141 maybe the pc trolls will finally understand being an apple customer in most cases means being a happy customer
6727142 i think the fact that a lot of pc manufactures sell cheap computers affects these results after all i think many users are disappointed in their 400 laptop running vista of course apple sells at a level that brings more satisfaction another possible reason is all the bloatware and anti virus suites forced on pc users from the get go this in itself slows a perfectly good pc down
6727143 the companies that drop in acsi are all windows based it is very likely that vista contributed to it
6727144 not only is apple the beneficiary of this vista dissatisfaction the synergy between ipods iphones and its computer products has helped has well
6727145 nice gesture but not really worth much they should stop billing altogether and give a bonus three months starting from when they actually get working three free months of a crippled poorly functioning service is hardly worth being excited about
6727146 wow that is a great pr move apple really i havent ever had any problems but i gladly take the extra 60 days in addition to the 30 you already gave me and smacklin the service has worked great for the majority of us
6727147 its very rare unless theres some kind of systemic problem like the computer battery thing from a couple of years ago but even then youre still talking about events that are relatively infrequent its like getting struck by lighting
6727148 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on
6727149 also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods
6727150 it has all these painful consequences and makes it difficult to move it results in a severe loss of quality of life for those who are affected by it
6727151 given the lack of knowledge about oa i think any method that is noninvasive and relatively easy to apply will be quite valuable not only do you address diagnosis but you address how we can understand oas mechanism
6727152 there are drugs on the market for oa treatment but no one really knows how effective they are after having done the research we got a lot of calls from pharmaceutical companies wanting to show that their drugs work
6727153 i really hope it will develop into the gold standard technique
6727154 im pretty confident in saying that its one of the better methods out there for testing cartilage health
6727155 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites
6727156 they have lots of reasons as to why they do that
6727157 i think that if you went in and could see whats going on in their minds though they may never say that stuff and im not saying theres some conspiracy or something like that but i think the thing is they realise that trading content copyrighted or not is an expected benefit of owning a computer

6727167 plenty of people miss their share of happiness not because they never found it but because they didnt stop to enjoy it
6727168 the happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature
6727169 will and i could hardly wait for the morning to come to get at something that interested us thats happiness

6727193 euroland either is now going backwards or is on the edge of declines in output in which case the uk strategy under this government of hitching us more firmly to the eu governmental bandwagon is doubly foolish being bad economics as well as bad politics

6727214 the bible calls debt a curse and children a blessing but in our culture we apply for a curse and reject blessings something is wrong with this picture
6727215 although our nations upper middle class actually consumes the most beverages a staggering percentage of these cans wind up in the hands of a very few
6727216 its a troubling trend and as a tiny fraction of the population continues to maintain its stranglehold on redeemable can wealth its a trend that shows no sign of slowing
6727217 members of this exclusive group come from exceedingly poor backgrounds and have access to outrageously low levels of education which makes them much better prepared to reap the benefits of digging around in garbage
6727218 the typical american spends an average of 65 on beverages for every dollar he or she earns back through redeemable deposits and the rest of that money goes to the countrys can and bottle barons
6727219 americans who are at a foraging disadvantage due to over employment and home ownership therefore have limited access to these discarded commodities causing the market to unfairly favor those with an exclusively disposables income
6727220 these people were born into a lifestyle often going back generations where any can left on the street is seen as their birthright whether they purchased it or not
6727221 they have the knowledge and ability to get out there and scoop up all the good cans before anyone even knew they were there

6727226 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
6727227 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
6727228 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
6727229 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
6727230 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
6727231 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
6727232 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy

6727239 we wanted to do something really different with the house of the dead overkill
6727240 with sega weve been able to create a fresh look for the franchise i think youll agree its like nothing youve seen before on wii
6727241 paying homage to the pulp horror comics and films that inspired generations of gore fans the house of the dead overkill will expose gamers to a brand new fleshy rollercoaster ride of revolting dismemberment

6727245 the average uk consumer spends 375 euro a year on health and beauty products far more than most of our european neighbours
6727246 we spend almost 50 more each year than the spanish for example and 43 more than the average european the british are certainly happy to splash out on looking good
6727247 its much worse than expected even the mighty service sector is growing at its slowest rate since 1995 the whole economy is back where it was in the last recession of 1992 we are closer to the edge
6727248 the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high commodity prices as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets
6727249 the governments priority is to guide britain through these challenging times while also supporting those hit hardest as a result of these global factors
6727250 just want to remind you to be careful when you go out at night
6727251 if i wasnt alright i wouldnt be able to chat with you right im fine i manage to cycle away
6727252 the first month when i arrived i was told to be careful because some people here can be racist i didnt believe them
6727253 i know it happened to a friend i met on campus as well
6727254 so remember to be careful if you go out at night if possible go in a group and not alone or dont go out at night
6727255 be careful when you go out at night theres a lots of racism
6727256 london isnt so bad in fact there are more foreigners than brits you may find that in the more rural areas of the uk but you wouldnt be going there

6727259 we had some tomatoes and i thought about using those and i had a neighbor who was always talking about doing a garlic beer so we added that i had some fresh oregano some basil an old packet of yeast
6727260 i said it probably wont work if it doesnt we can just cook with it
6727261 the first time we tasted it we looked at each other and said you know its actually good
6727262 none of them worked so i said you know what lets pop open one of those tomato beers we gave it one taste and i said holy s this is fantastic its perfect with pizza

6727265 developers with large land banks and incomplete projects are opting for the build to suit model to deal with the current situation this benefits both developers and tenants

6727267 we are open for such build to suit projects though we have not done one yet

6727338 i am pleased to report another quarter during which we have grown revenues improved margins and strengthened our balance sheet the important steps we have taken over the past year to improve operational efficiency and develop market leading products are beginning to show genuine improvements to our bottom line and this gives me confidence that we are better positioned than ever for future growth
6727339 although we managed to improve margins during the first half of the year we still face a number of potential challenges in the second half in particular wafer costs and wafer quality
6727340 we are now in a far more stable financial position and are better placed to secure long term supply agreements to expand production and to fund r amp d enhancement in a cost effective manner our contract with rec will help us to reduce overall wafer costs from 2009 we remain cautious about the overall market outlook for wafer prices in the second half of this year however the expected increase in high efficiency cell production will enable us to at least partially offset any increase in wafer cost

6727355 i cannot imagine giuliani a pro choice anti gun liberal winning the nomination he will tear the party apart distort the meaning of what it is to be a republican and a conservative and govern with an iron fist worse yet giuliani proclaimed in the june cnn presidential debate that he seeks to expand the failed doctrine of nation building how can any serious voter consider casting a ballot in favor of any candidate who has endorsed a strategy that has been proven to be failed doctrine reason com reports that in a speech at the citadel in may candidate giuliani stated that this idea of nation building is not one you want to undertake lightly but whether we wanted to or not its now our responsibility weve got to get it done right in the june cnn republican debate he unequivocally endorsed nation building when he said that we have great resources in this country and watching the strength of america when we believe in the essential ideals that we have theyre not just american ideals they come from god and i think its our moral obligation to find the right way to share that with the rest of the world giuliani is not a conservative and not a republican he is a neo wilsonian big government liberal who believes in using the power of a large powerful government to get the results that he wants nation building does not work we are trying it and failing at it right now in mesopotamia giuliani has somehow come to the conclusion that it is our mission to bring american values to the middle east even if our own national interest does not require such action

6727497 the rewards are in your head the reward is invisible its what you like to do
6727498 we had dreams that computers would improve education and improve communication and help us achieve a lot of tasks a lot of us in our group understood it
6727499 what we were doing was not figuring out how build a computer it was how you get a computer that fits into the home
6727500 i was doing really advanced computer designs when i was 10
6727501 i just loved computers and what they were and ones and zeros and the logic and how they added
6727502 sometimes when youre short of resources it forces you to do better work
6727503 i couldnt afford an online timeshare computer system i had to write down ones and zeros and simulate the computers operations it was all done by hand never once on a computer
6727504 some of the tricks were so weird i knew youd never find them in a book
6727505 i got a job a hewlett packard designing handheld calculators i was very lucky because i could design they interviewed and hired me but i didnt have a degree
6727506 i did go back to college i got my degree under a fake name rocky raccoon clark
6727507 i wanted my kids to see they had a dad who had a college degree i went back 10 years after i finished my third year
6727508 i would not sell something for money without my employer getting a cut of it
6727509 i was never going to leave hp for life thats where i wanted to be forever
6727510 steve jobs got all my friends and relatives to call me
6727511 steve wants to be this guy who wants to change the world every time wed create something great hed have the idea to sell it
6727512 the speed of the computer isnt enough you need a good approach and good thinking
6727513 sometimes i go into an apple store and say im an employee i get a discount
6727514 these press guys who write stuff like that they get seated first in the prime seats
6727515 now were in the age of blogs opinions get replicated facts dont come into play much
6727516 i dont like any articles that put people down like steve jobs because it sells everybody likes to see heroes beat up
6727517 were in the business of growing the linux platform and making sure the development process of linux is maintained in a way that is productive and safe
6727518 one of the things that make linux work as a development project is the fact that linus torvalds who is the final decision maker on the release of the kernel works at a place that is not one of the competitors that collaborates on the project
6727519 the foundation is a perfect place for people to come together on projects that are difficult long require coordination and arent necessarily strategic from a competitive point of view so vendors want to share the cost
6727520 everyone just has a different approach and they cant agree on just one its really just an issue of discipline within the industry and the community
6727521 im not the cop here on this stuff and i would rather see community members coming to a rough consensus rather than us saying what to do
6727522 weve expanded the board to be more participatory and opened up seats for community members
6727523 we have more board level representation from smaller organizations and the ability to be on our board is much more affordable than it was under the osdl
6727524 my goal in the organization is to diversify our revenues so we have a broad base of representation
6727525 so no single entity dominates the organization and i think weve achieved that
6727526 they serve a great purpose in bringing together the community commercial linux companies and end users and they represent the interests of each group very well we have a very close relationship with jim and were very pleased with the direction hes taken the linux foundation
6727527 they the linux foundation try to stay neutral and not assume they are the ones owning development
6727528 in general they have done a good job at trying to get companies to provide specifications and legal assistance to developers in general from what we can see the development community is neutral to positive about the linux foundation
6727529 it was not like that i didnt lose my motivation today quite the opposite i knew i had done all i could and that i could win if i played better than i have ever done before
6727530 in the early games i wasnt so sure about myself or our chances of progressing and when you are not so certain of what you can do you do shout more maybe you are trying to convince yourself
6727531 but today i felt very calm and i knew that there was only one thing i could do it was to play the best i could and i can assure you that was what i did
6727532 we are quite new to this game and the americans we faced are great players they have a great legacy and we are catching up but i think we will be better in the next olympics in sport all you can do is fight as hard as you can we just had to accept that we were against the better players but that was only after the game was over
6727533 that it was impossible to believe they have been playing the game for just a few years in london in four years time i know they will give anyone in the world as much as if not more than they can handle they are coming on so fast
6727534 it was our first olympics we didnt know what to expect but we can now prepare ourselves over the next four years
6727535 im really looking forward to london were going to use this experience and hopefully be challenging for the medals in 2012
6727536 i was pleased with my last dive and i was pleased with my first dive as well because it was an armstand and youre always a bit more nervous on your first dive than the other dives you can be a bit wobbly but my handstand was fine and it was the best i did in all three rounds so i was pleased with that
6727537 im really pleased with myself i was in the semi which i was proud of and then i made it to the final i was 12th in qualifying so i just came out here and enjoyed myself and thats what ive done im not just an olympian im an olympic finalist
6727538 deteriorating and unfavourable conditions prevailing in the retail development market
6727539 we were bitterly disappointed by their decision to walk away from stockport obviously theres a credit crunch going on but we hoped that they would able to ride the storm instead they duck for cover the minute the wind picks up we offered to mothball this development for 18 months or two years but still they werent interested i suggest the government keeps an eye on them because if they walked away from me they could walk away from east london
6727540 it establishes a structure for lend lease to continue its role in overseeing and managing the construction of the olympic village giving certainty of completion by 2012
6727541 we can confirm billy joe saunders has received a letter from the amateur boxing association suspending him pending a hearing
6727542 my focus over the next 48 hours is to prepare my three boxers for their semi final bouts tomorrow the allegations made in the media about the conduct of athletes on the british boxing programme are on the whole unfounded
6727543 i feel extremely disillusioned that i have learnt of the suspension of one of my boxers from the media i have three boxers who are fighting to win gold medals and i will not allow anything to distract my lads from what they need to do in the ring
6727544 the amateur boxing association choosing to yesterday issue billy joe saunders with a suspension relating to an incident which happened months before the beijing olympic games is extremely disappointing
6727545 the release of these allegations at this time could prove detrimental to the critical preparations of the other three boxers who will be contesting to reach the final of the boxing competition
6727546 we are frustrated that our athletes and the boxing coaching team will have to deal with this distraction at this point in the games nobody involved with boxing should be distracting the team at this time
6727547 i hope this matter does not overshadow what has been a fantastic games for the british olympic boxing team it is our best olympics for more than 30 years since 1972 and could be even better if one of our boxers win gold
6727548 viewers can vote by text messages for their favourite and their votes help to decide the contestants fate which is a totally new concept on chinese tv
6727549 the voting segment is now widely believed to be one of the key factors in the shows popularity
6727550 in chinese talent shows friendship among the contestants is highlighted and praised while competitiveness is frowned upon
6727551 chinese reality shows are less dramatic and fierce more harmonious and morality oriented compared to their counterparts on western tv no jerry springer here
6727552 because of the way he performed here he could potentially win 12 golds in london but like when i made the comment about whether hed win eight here thorpe said no it depends very much on him
6727553 weve all worked so hard and we live to run that car its difficult to know what to say were in shock were walking around like zombies at the moment the race is due to start and we dont know what to do its a big loss for all of us
6727554 its a family team of 10 and this is a huge setback if we dont get the car back we wont be able to compete this afternoon or afford to carry on for the rest of the year
6727555 a husband and wife on a tour of ireland happened to be sleeping in a car 20 yards away from our van and trailer and they raised the alarm after seeing the thieves towing away our trailer
6727556 we are lucky they contacted the police so quickly otherwise we wouldnt have known anything about it for another five hours
6727557 he did not commit the offense for which he was convicted
6727558 those of you who do know chris for his previous work or with an attention span that lasts more than just a couple of paragraphs will have noted that this is the second chris taylor game to bear the naming format of something siege and thats with good reason though space siege isnt a true sequel to dungeon siege in any way shape or form it is kind of a follow up a spiritual successor if you will the differences are many though dungeon siege was a colourful medieval romp with a hit and miss approach to gameplay space siege is a generic hallway grindfest with a sci fi theme plopped on top like a glaze of week old ketchup which is to say no matter how much you like ketchup youll probably find this mostly bland and tiresome still the ingredient of this particular ketchup are the earth has been mostly destroyed by an alien race and you are an engineer on the last ship left which also happens to get a small infestation of the aliens stowing away on board oh and tomato puree
6727559 dit is echt ziek je kind wil een tekening downloaden op sesamstraat nl en hij zit opeens op een site waar hij nog lang niet aan toe is wat bezielt mensen

6727561 he did not commit the offense for which he was convicted
6727562 mind you im not wild about computers myself but they are a tool if you have a tool its stupid not to use it
6727563 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
6727564 the state of emergency will ensure more security on the polling day for voters
6727565 in case you missed it this week there was a tragedy in kansas ten thousand people died an entire town destroyed
6727566 over the last 15 months weve traveled to every corner of the united states ive now been in 57 states i think one left to go
6727567 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma alabama because some folks are willing to march across a bridge so they got together and barack obama jr was born
6727568 ive made it clear for years that the threat from iran is grave
6727569 kami melakukan kerjasama dengan pihak kepolisian dan kerjasama untuk menangani kasus kasus korupsi yang terjadi di daerah
6727570 kami pasti menindaklanjuti kalau diperkirakan masih bisa di tangani aparat penegak hukum di daerah maka kami limpahkan ke daerah
6727571 kami akan berusaha mencegah melalui beberapa program tapi kalau tidak bisa dicegah maka relakan kami mengambil tindakan hukum
6727572 mereka akan memonitor berapa kasus yang sudah ditangani dan sisanya ada berapa juga mendata berapa kasus korupsi yang dilaporkan masyarakat dan proses penanganannya
6727573 the destruction of the islamic khilafah state over 80 years ago marked the beginning of dividing the muslim world into countless nation states governed by a plethora of kings dictators and western backed democrats
6727574 that very week i had been toying with the idea of blogging going so far as to have set up an as yet unpublished first post
6727575 blogs and wikis are now becoming mainstream communication tools but who in the department of the navy is actually using them
6727576 were incredibly fortunate to have pete geren secretary of the u s army and general george casey chief of staff of the u s army join us via phone for the bloggers roundtable panel
6727577 i value the diary tremendously but im scared stiff its going to get lost
6727578 the army does not routinely monitor blogs regarding postings of specific personnel or groups of personnel it is not standard practice for the military to target or single out individual military blogs unless a particular blog has been brought to the attention of the chain of command or other dod department of defense officials for gross opsec operational security violations
6727579 the success of that is what will be the turning point for the soldiers to come home the faster we reconstruct the faster the soldiers can come back
6727580 there are instantaneous communications taking place around the world and we need to figure out how to take advantage of that opportunity instead of looking at it as a nemesis
6727581 you can call it strategic communication you can call it information engagement i like to call it operating in the information domain of the 21st century
6727582 so i decided after reading some other milblogs to start my own to vent my frustrations and try to keep my sanity intact as much as possible
6727583 i like what i am wearing and i dont give a damn what yall think
6727584 what the hell is that and what are you suppose to do with it
6727585 when it comes to producing clean power were determined to make new york the no 1 city in the nation
6727586 people are likely to oppose technologies that alter the appearance of their neighborhoods wind harnessing technology can be exceedingly expensive
6727587 and mr bloomberg has less than 18 months left in office to put a plan into place
6727588 our draft resolution is a reconfirmation of the six point agreement and theres no territorial integrity in the six principles
6727589 we believe the six principles are clear and already implemented
6727590 what we see on the ground is the result of ambiguity
6727591 we have a presence of so called russian peacekeeping forces at key georgian choke points that will control economic life it will control humanitarian activities thats why clarifications are so important
6727592 theres no way that russian positions can be considered in line with the resolution
6727593 as far as the marriage issue our focus on marriage is on the state and local level
6727594 we consider this as extremely important non violent action taken by tibetans under the leadership of his holiness the dalai lama in a very critical period for tibet particularly the post olympic period
6727595 the way it is set up today very few people apart from the record industry are getting rich on digital music generally speaking the music today isnt generating a boat load of cash for us
6727596 we are indeed refraining from taking part in such activities it is a step we are forced to take we did not initiate this situation
6727597 from the russian point of view the usefulness of this operation is extremely dubious
6727598 the uss mcfall is under way now having taken on humanitarian supplies for the people of destroyer mcfall would be followed by the coast guard cutter dallas and the command ship uss mount whitney
6727599 the russians have been informed along the way about our activities and our intentions
6727600 conducting a pre planned routine visit to the black sea region to interact and exercise with our nato partners bulgaria which is an important feature of our routine planning
6727601 je pense que de nombreux touristes asiatiques se sont rendus au japon plut t que de choisir des destinations lointaines cela en raison de la hausse des prix du p trole

6727603 le s nateur de larizona a t il trop de maisons pour sen souvenir ou pr f re t il ne pas aborder le sujet connaissant parfaitement la valeur de son patrimoine quelle que soit la r ponse son image en a t un peu corn e
6727604 je suppose que si vous pensez quon est riche partir de 5 millions de dollars de revenus et si vous ne savez pas combien de maisons vous avez il nest pas tonnant de croire que l conomie est solide
6727605 mais si vous tes comme moi et que vous poss dez une maison ou que vous tes comme des millions de gens qui luttent pour rembourser leur pr t immobilier et ne pas perdre leur toit vous devez avoir une vision diff rente

6727609 barack obamas failure to accurately report his campaigns financial records is an incredibly suspicious situation that appears to be an attempt to hide his campaigns interaction with a left wing organization previously convicted of voter fraud for a candidate who claims to be practicing new politics his fec reports look an awful lot like the old style chicago politics of yesterday
6727610 the rnc can concoct all of the outlandish conspiracy theories they want but when we saw that our fec report didnt accurately reflect the field work csi was hired to perform we corrected it its pretty bold for the rnc to attack us for a clerical error after john mccains campaign was just forced to return 50 000 raised by a foreign national through a number of contributors who werent even supporting mccain
6727611 its rare that people dont file any amended reports if he has a pattern of lots and lots of amended reports that would be more noteworthy than an occasional one
6727612 all of this just seems like an awful lot of money and time spent on political campaigning for an organization that purports to exist to help low income consumers
6727613 acorn has a long and sordid history of employing convoluted enron style accounting to illegally use taxpayer funds for their own political gain
6727614 now it looks like acorn is using the same type of convoluted accounting scheme for obamas political gain
6727615 that was a very short term contract for one week of work in ohio they asked us to do canvasses in five cities statewide
6727616 assist persons and organizations who advance the interests of low and moderate income people
6727617 i do not know the day to day work of what they do im on the board
6727618 not for profit political and campaign management firm much like any political consulting firm
6727619 we have a wide range of clients we provide political campaign management we provide field services
6727620 our clients are typically considered liberal our clients are labor unions liberal to progressive candidates nonprofit organizations on the liberal side of the political spectrum
6727621 we are organized specifically not to make money but we make money there are no profits we have a staff of 60 people around the country and that eats up our entire profit were not a for profit corporation but we are not a group like a united way
6727622 acorn has a lot of different partner organizations we are a partner but we are separate
6727623 i think we have been really successful we have been able to put the spotlight on this issue which is globally significant
6727624 this is not the end of our campaign this is just the beginning
6727625 it has shown to the world and chinese government that people of conscience around the world will stand up and speak with solidarity for tibetans that they also support tibetans cause

6727637 w e have to confess our disappointment with many of the people reagan has chosen for his administration
6727638 we can live with any one two or three of them even though most are not the men we would have chosen what disturbs me is the pattern expressed by the choices
6727639 the establishment is politically impotent it has very little in common with or appreciation for the various parts of the new coalition that elected ronald reagan reagan appealed for the votes of pro lifers born again christians opponents of busing blue collar workers and those patriotic americans who want an america militarily superior to anyone and they responded with their contributions and votes these people understood that he was a man who shared their deepest values but holding those values is one thing implementing them is another
6727640 when reagan left the governors office in january 1975 liberals took immediate charge of most statewide offices and both houses of the legislature they have controlled the state ever since and a simple reason is that reagan didnt work to build a conservative power structure one that would carry on his conservative principles long after he was gone is he again going to pass up a historic opportunity to put together a conservative coalition that will govern america well into the next century
6727641 to date he has chosen for the most part to surround himself with men who are safe safe for him personally that is but possibly fatal to the opportunity that now exists he has chosen basically older men of credentials and experience men who already enjoy public stature men from the eastern republican establishment reagan has appointed what columnists roland evans and robert novak call an old gray cabinet he has decided to play it safe by naming men who may have distinguished pasts but almost surely wont have long futures its part of most peoples nature that when they reach a certain time in life usually before their 60th birthday they cease acting in a bold imaginative creative way

6727656 they say i live on a dollar a month but this is all lies by people who dont want my brother to win
6727657 people keep asking questions but i have met him only twice and i cant speak about what kind of man he is
6727658 if people ask about my name i tell them we are not related the problem here is that people have expectations and think i would look after them
6727659 he has already done so many firsts as black president of the harvard law review and getting the nomination so we believe he will win

6727707 we all know that guy who can go down to the hardware store and rig up something with pvc pipe to solve a problem at their house what if you had a superhero who got his equipment from the hardware store and dealt with things like meth labs

6727709 i want to see works in progress as much as i want to see finished works
6727710 were in the business of growing the linux platform and making sure the development process of linux is maintained in a way that is productive and safe
6727711 one of the things that make linux work as a development project is the fact that linus torvalds who is the final decision maker on the release of the kernel works at a place that is not one of the competitors that collaborates on the project
6727712 the foundation is a perfect place for people to come together on projects that are difficult long require coordination and arent necessarily strategic from a competitive point of view so vendors want to share the cost
6727713 everyone just has a different approach and they cant agree on just one its really just an issue of discipline within the industry and the community
6727714 im not the cop here on this stuff and i would rather see community members coming to a rough consensus rather than us saying what to do
6727715 weve expanded the board to be more participatory and opened up seats for community members
6727716 we have more board level representation from smaller organizations and the ability to be on our board is much more affordable than it was under the osdl
6727717 my goal in the organization is to diversify our revenues so we have a broad base of representation
6727718 so no single entity dominates the organization and i think weve achieved that
6727719 they serve a great purpose in bringing together the community commercial linux companies and end users and they represent the interests of each group very well we have a very close relationship with jim and were very pleased with the direction hes taken the linux foundation
6727720 they the linux foundation try to stay neutral and not assume they are the ones owning development
6727721 in general they have done a good job at trying to get companies to provide specifications and legal assistance to developers in general from what we can see the development community is neutral to positive about the linux foundation
6727722 the judges should have been restored within 24 hours of musharrafs ouster through a parliamentary resolution musharraf resigned on august 18 and the judges should technically have been reinstated on august 19 but this did not happen
6727723 we have now said that since the next two days are holidays the resolution for reinstating the deposed judges should be tabled in the national assembly on monday

6727769 i expect to catch that ball ive got to catch that
6727770 id been playing punto to pull all night and he hit it right where i was supposed to be if it hits your glove youve got to catch that
6727771 i could have buried that split finger a little bit better than i did
6727772 i could have bounced it a little bit more and gone for the strikeout and if i did who knows what would have happened i do everything to prepare myself to pitch but im not getting the results i want its frustrating
6727773 nicky ripped it pretty good and torii had a long ways to go
6727774 weve seen him make plenty of catches like that and im glad he didnt make it but hes as good as they get out there we got a little lucky there
6727775 it all starts with pitching and scott baker was really really good going up against mr lackey whos always really good against us
6727776 we knew we were going to be in for a battle and it was its a nice start to a road trip
6727777 lackey can bear down and make pitches in situations like that as good as anybody in the game
6727778 we missed some opportunities but in those opportunities you look over at the other side and you see whos pitching he didnt miss too many spots
6727779 when you hit it good you kind of have that look
6727780 but i know this park and the ball doesnt really travel at night i hit it good enough but at 387 feet its a little deep i guess that was tough to swallow
6727781 but we have not started our conversations with the ioc international olympic committee maybe we will begin talks next year
6727782 with all its issues it is still a very strong property to have
6727783 wouldnt it be fun to take a hip hop class
6727784 my home is a red desert that trembles with spirits and bones
6727785 he was a strong leader who was highly respected by those around him
6727786 he believed in what he was doing and he knew he was making a difference for the people there we love him and we will miss him
6727787 he wanted his friends to have no fear for him because he had no fear of the mission in afghanistan
6727788 we truly believe that if he came home safe that he would request to return for another tour
6727789 he just wanted to make a difference and believe that he was doing right and he had the support from his family and friends and that he was doing the right thing
6727790 what id say is that theyre much more aggressive this fighting season than theyve been in the past
6727791 they were a well trained highly motivated crew and believed in their mission
6727792 i was immersed in the arts there and its a privilege i carry with me to this day
6727793 ive always been a huge admirer of mr combs and his vision how he exists in the world
6727794 im interested in this person whos involved in the entertainment industry in so many different elements being his assistant is like an internship of sorts
6727795 it sounds grandiose but i thought that mr combs embracing me on the show would be a historic moment in this country
6727796 hes a revolutionary im the first transgender black person on a reality show i feel a responsibility being on tv but it doesnt mean anything if people dont learn anything
6727797 i wore a skirt in high school and got a lot of attention
6727798 but ive always had the audacity of hope to quote mr obama
6727799 as a transgender woman i felt like i had to be better than anybody else
6727800 and i maybe felt more pressure than everyone else to me the stakes were very high i certainly didnt go on the show to lose
6727801 and i wanted to get along with people i wanted them to like me
6727802 this is just me no script doing things and saying how i feel
6727803 i think oh my god my hair my makeup choice the other night they showed me in bed crying a mess eating several snickers bars my team lost a challenge and that was hard but it was even harder watching myself on camera
6727804 ik kan eindelijk laten weten dat tom en ik een baby verwachten en dat we heel blij zijn
6727805 iedereen vraagt of ik de volgende ben die een baby kan verwachten ik heb er een hekel aan om mensen teleur te stellen maar het antwoord is nee
6727806 ik doe het rustig aan maar wil ook gaan schrijven voor mijn vijfde album
6727807 want uit mijn dak gaan is momenteel niet echt mogelijk
6727808 having the boomerang back in kurnell will be a historic symbol of harmony between our two cultures and will help teach young australians about the importance of aboriginal culture
6727809 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games
6727810 were looking at budget cuts next year 75 to 120 million if we could offset some or all of the cost of our fuel increase with something like this thats hard not to look at
6727811 were going to look at obvious alternatives natural gas propane anything else that might come along hybrid is something we may see here very soon
6727812 it is a big task but i think its one that really goes to the heart of what our office can do
6727813 the strength of our reports is that theyre thorough and the analysis cant be faulted and our recommendations are reasonable practical improvements
6727814 we really are an independent and impartial office and if i thought about that i think that would be a fatal mistake and would show that i was not doing my job properly
6727815 i recognize that while we have made many significant improvements in seniors care in this province this is a system that is also capable and deserving of much improvement
6727816 these are the elders that built this province and they deserve the best of care thats why we have a quite elaborate system of licensing and licensing officers and medical health officers and thousands of employees who dedicate themselves to providing that care
6727817 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
6727818 he wont be ready for saturday but has a chance to be ok for wednesday we dont want to gamble on him for one game we have to be patient
6727819 i think were going to stay around 3 for a number of months
6727820 when youre faced with such extremes oftentimes the best thing for the central bank to do is to do nothing to make sure you dont aggravate either one of the two extremes
6727821 i do this every day i do this well every day
6727822 i hate watching people apologize after a bad performance but i now know why they do it
6727823 there was a lot of pressure on me and that pressure amounted to expectations of people back home
6727824 diria que muitas pessoas ficaram desapontadas com o fato de burning crusade n o ter sido lan ado antes do natal mas ele n o estava pronto foi a decis o correta para o jogo
6727825 this is likely to be of benefit both in the search for new drugs and equally significantly in understanding how chinese medicine works
6727826 the figure is still quite impressive and i estimate this will rise substantially in the next few years
6727827 china has become a notable factor in the scientific landscape usually scientific development in nations does not show such a strong acceleration as we have seen in china so it will be interesting to see how it responds and develops in the future
6727828 i fought her in manchester england for the 2008 olympic qualification and i lost to her
6727829 as long as i go in there and give everything that i have i should be getting it
6727830 im satisfied that im going to the finals and i will come prepared for it
6727831 usually its always like that but thats what you want
6727832 finals are always icing on the cake its going to be a big match
6727833 years of sacrifice a lot of work and finally getting a medal for it
6727834 this is my life this is what i do every single day theres only one gold medal per division and theres only four divisions
6727835 i was trying to be more offensive with the offensive advantage they were supposed to give me the decision and they didnt
6727836 it was really tight but i thought i had the victory the referees wont give any points theyre really tough
6727837 bad referees decisions it happens often but i have to live with it
6727838 if i dont want to deal with this im going to be a sprinter or a swimmer

6727841 have the potential to revolutionise education in ways that are difficult to imagine
6727842 with this success rate of about 24 percent we are way above the results that could be expected from searching through large chemical substance libraries
6727843 we are combining natural substance research with advanced analytical and molecular biological methods
6727844 plant constituents that seem particularly promising are immediately subjected to further tests
6727845 we can expect to find many interesting yet unknown working mechanisms among the chemically highly diverse natural substances currently we are aligning the effectiveness of the substances on 60 different cancer cell lines with the gene activity profiles of these cells thus we can determine the exact gene products that are the cellular targets of our compounds thereby it may be possible to discover whole new achilles heels of the cancer cell
6727846 does not have legal custody of her two children due to a history of neglect
6727847 the suspects parents have court ordered legal custody of the abducted children 9 year old meagan and 5 year old jeremy roy
6727848 terminal 3 and the associated development represent a much needed expansion of dubais aviation infrastructure the new facility will play an important role in supporting dubais economic progress and reaffirm the citys image as an emerging global aviation hub
6727849 we want to make absolutely sure that all the systems and processes at terminal 3 are working smoothly and that customers experience nothing short of world class facilities and service when they use the new terminal it is precisely for this reason that we have decided to make terminal 3 fully operational in phases
6727850 the centre will primarily serve the informal trading sector and the taxi drivers at the mall
6727851 it will serve as a platform from which the informal sector will improve their businesses and also provide hiv aids advisory services to both informal traders and the taxi industry
6727852 the mtc was established in 1999 to basically run trader markets and public transport facilities
6727853 but this mandate has grown and become wider and wider as we came to understand our customers better and better
6727854 it represents a new exciting and far reaching concept our vision is to see the centre providing health services to more than 500 000 people yearly
6727855 with a total of over 28 albatross and petrel species recorded caught by south african fisheries the south african seas are an important feeding ground for many albatrosses and petrels
6727856 thirteen of these recorded species are currently threatened with extinction resulting from several factors including the deterioration of breeding habitats and targeted hunting and fishing operations
6727857 in south africa a recent eastward displacement of fish stocks seems to have produced a mismatch in the distributions of the breeding localities and prey of several seabirds with damaging effects
6727858 in addition south africas sub antarctic prince edward islands holds 44 percent of the world population of wandering albatross and 21 percent of the global population of indian yellow nosed albatross
6727859 launching the npoa seabirds at the opening of the acap meeting is particularly significant as it demonstrates south africas continued commitment to conservation and management of seabirds in a sustainable and responsible manner
6727860 with our technology we can image specific cells in real time with exquisite selectivity which allows us to track their location and movement and to count the apparent number of cells present we then use conventional mri to obtain a high resolution image that places the labeled cells in their anatomical context
6727861 the large background signal from mobile water and intrinsic tissue contrast differences can often make it challenging to unambiguously identify regions containing these metal ion labeled cells throughout the body which is the current state of the art
6727862 right now were using our technology to image key cell types involved in autoimmune diseases like type i diabetes but our cellular mri agents also can be adapted to label other cell types including cells from bone marrow and stem cells a key long term application of our technology is to label and monitor cell based therapeutics in humans
6727863 ideally we would label therapeutic cells with our cellular mri agents before they are implanted into a patient in this way we could use mri to visualize the movement of the therapeutic cells in the patient to monitor whether they migrate to and remain in the desired tissues
6727864 were trying to get the nerve tissue to integrate with a device to grow into it to form a better connection
6727865 to get long term release we think these multi component systems are the way to go
6727866 we can control the release by combining the materials in different ways and were confident that we can extend the release time further even to 90 days
6727867 problems with the use and sizing of graduated compression stockings are common throughout the country and this study is one of the first to systematically analyze the problems and recommend ways to improve practice
6727868 based on the study findings we recommend that knee length stockings be the standard length used and that the education of nurses and patients about the proper use of stockings be improved
6727869 a lot can be done to optimize the benefits of graduated compression stockings and minimize adverse effects
6727870 knee length stockings have many practical advantages over thigh length in that they lower the risk of problems and health care costs the improper use and sizing of these stockings and the deficiencies in patient education are important health care issues
6727871 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more
6727872 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
6727873 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
6727874 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
6727875 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration
6727876 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6727877 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
6727878 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
6727879 this would appear to be true even if the obesity results from binge eating as this disorder is characterized by eating patterns that are similar to drug taking patterns in those with cocaine dependency
6727880 we have known for some time that young and middle aged adults who are overweight run a higher risk of death and it was presumed that this held true for older people in fact our results show that the risk of dying is higher only for the most severely obese but that all older people who are overweight are at significantly increased risk of developing problems with mobility and carrying out everyday tasks
6727881 this research is important because a growing proportion of the population is aged 65 or over and more and more of these older people are overweight in fact in most developed countries middle aged and elderly adults are more likely to be obese than people in any other age group these findings have huge significance for the delivery of health care both now and in the future increasing numbers of older people and higher levels of overweight and obesity will lead to a greater burden of disability and ill health and place an immense strain on health and social services the issue is likely to get worse as time goes on and represents a ticking time bomb for health services around the world
6727882 staying a healthy weight can be a fun and relatively easy thing to do even as people get older
6727883 our experience of running supported walking and cycling groups has shown that older people benefit in many ways from regular physical activity
6727884 people are living longer but this study shows that excess weight can have a real impact on the quality of peoples lives which can reduce the benefit of those extra years
6727885 this report highlights the problem of obesity in an increasingly ageing population
6727886 effects of high fat diet exposure during fetal life on type 2 diabetes development in the progeny
6727887 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like
6727888 and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient
6727889 by understanding how calcium is detected in the mouth we can either make it easier to consume by reducing its bad taste or even make pharmacological agents that make it taste better
6727890 most mice dislike calcium but we found a very unusual strain that drinks it avidly
6727891 by comparing the genes of this strain with other strains we were able to identify the two calcium taste genes
6727892 it remains to be seen if what we have discovered in mice the existence of two calcium taste genes holds true for humans
6727893 we know people have the sweet taste gene tas1r3 and the gene involved with the calcium sensing receptor casr we dont know if we have the same forms of genes as the mice have but it seems pretty likely they have the same function
6727894 there isnt a better word for it it is bitter perhaps even a little sour but its much more because there are actual receptors for calcium not just bitter or sour compounds
6727895 in tap water its fairly pleasant but at levels much above that the taste becomes increasingly bad
6727896 im not saying people cant take tablets to get enough calcium but eating real food is a great pleasure with salt sweet and fat the problem is to reduce intake without reducing palatability for calcium its a problem of being not palatable enough
6727897 this unparalleled support and endorsement is the engine that will drive real change for people impacted by mental illness and addiction
6727898 the new environment that we can now build as part of our bold redevelopment will greatly increase the opportunities for researchers clients and partners to work together to generate timely relevant research that can seamlessly translate into clinical practice that provides optimal care
6727899 as we celebrate camhs 10th anniversary and officially open the first phase of our redeveloping queen street site were also witnessing a turning point in the history of mental illness and addiction research thanks to the generosity support and faith of cfi
6727900 due to stigma psychiatry and addiction treatment are behind many other areas of medicine this support provides many of the tools we need to dramatically improve client community and workplace health reduce the burden of these diseases and their impact on the health care system
6727901 camhs proposal brings together a group of outstanding researchers to advance a world class innovative research agenda
6727902 the proposed research will be an important factor in enhancing knowledge and public awareness of mental health and addictions
6727903 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage
6727904 teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
6727905 higher rates of reproductive dysfunction in adult women may reflect the cumulative effects of longer exposure to alcohol for older women than for female adolescents
6727906 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
6727907 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
6727908 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
6727909 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
6727910 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties
6727911 the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible alcohol abuse or dependence
6727912 the erongo region of namibia is renowned for its richness in fisheries and agricultural products among others these remain some of the potential areas of collaboration with our province
6727913 south africa and namibia share a special historical bond which dates back many decades when both of us were involved in the protracted struggle against apartheid and colonialism
6727914 it is expected that this mission will cement this common heritage and also promote the existing cultural and economic ties between our people
6727915 isolated just one milligram a very tiny amount from natural sources that were very difficult to grow
6727916 we needed to develop a concise and efficient synthetic route to make enough largazole for animal studies
6727917 my labs next task was finding the origin of lagarzoles biological activity
6727918 it could be a very good drug candidate for the treatment of various cancers
6727919 obesity is occurring at epidemic rates in the u s and worldwide and that impacts the risk and prognosis of many diseases
6727920 we hope this study can be translated into applications to help treat or prevent obesity
6727921 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain in the body
6727922 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population
6727923 however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6727924 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity
6727925 our findings may someday allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages
6727926 chemical biomarkers may eventually serve as objective clinical markers of disease if effective sensor technology can be developed
6727927 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
6727928 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
6727929 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
6727930 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
6727931 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
6727932 but what was really cool is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frog and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals
6727933 our findings suggest that msc therapy could become a useful treatment for inflammatory bowel disease
6727934 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
6727935 the intestine may be an ideal site for msc therapy given its rapid ability to regrow tissue and its extensive local supply of lymph nodes and the route by which the cells were administered may have ensured a greater amount of engraftment in gut associated lymph nodes
6727936 before we can think about testing this approach in patients we need to know more about long term effects of msc infusion including immunosuppressive effects and gain more understanding of how mscs modulate immune cell activity in more realistic models of inflammatory bowel disease
6727937 this is the fourth report on cancer survival in australia in 23 years with improvements each time and an overall increase in five year survival of around 30 per cent
6727938 sixty four per cent of australian women and 58 per cent of men are now alive five years after a cancer diagnosis compared with 53 and 41 per cent respectively between 1982 and 1986 with particularly good results for patients aged between 50 and 70
6727939 the findings reflect the effectiveness of early detection and advances in chemotherapy radiation therapy and surgery which are extending the lives of people diagnosed with a range of cancers
6727940 with 655 000 australians either living with an invasive cancer or as a long term cancer survivor we have to pull together as a community to support individuals and their families through the many difficulties of a cancer diagnosis
6727941 the new data also show that we have made very limited progress in treating some complex and aggressive tumours such as those of the lung brain pancreas and cancers of unknown primary source underscoring the need for more research
6727942 adding urgency to the need for programs and services that reduce social inequity in cancer care outcomes
6727943 da wir so gro e hersteller wie mercedes und audi haben k nnen wir auf einem sehr hohen niveau rennen fahren
6727944 und in gro britannien gibt es keine top hersteller die den motorsport und junge fahrer so unterst tzen k nnen wie das mercedes in der dtm tut es ist eine der besten serien f r einen rennfahrer deshalb fahren wir in deutschland
6727945 das auto sieht aus wie ein stra enwagen aber es ist ein echter rennwagen die karosserie ist aus kohlefaser und es ist speziell f r den rennsport entwickelt es ist kein getunter stra enwagen sondern es ist ein richtiger rennwagen es sind die schnellsten tourenwagen der welt
6727946 wir haben einen v8 motor von daher haben wir schon mal viel mehr power als die meisten tourenwagen und das bringt nat rlich auch einen tollen motorensound mit sich ich denke dass der sound von dtm autos etwas besonderes ist das macht das ganze spektakel noch aufregender
6727947 es geht viel bergauf und bergab das ist recht interessant es ist f r ein dtm auto eine recht kurze strecke aber es ist ein gutes beispiel f r das spektakel das die dtm bieten m chte die fans sehen die autos auf der ganzen runde aber die fahrer haben es mit einer kurzen strecke mit wenigen kurven zu tun das ist etwas ganz anderes als die meisten dtm strecken es gibt keine langen geraden man hat keine zeit sich zu erholen von daher ist es physisch und mental eine gro e herausforderung
6727948 er ist ein paar jahre j nger als ich aber ich habe seine rennen immer gesehen und gesehen wie talentiert er war dann sind wir zusammen in der formel renault und der formel 3 gefahren 2004 habe ich ihn dort geschlagen als ich den titel geholt habe wir kennen uns ganz gut und es ist sch n wenn er da ist und ein dtm event unterst tzt
6727949 ich denke dass alle fahrer dieses ziel haben aber wenn man in egal welcher serie man f hrt nicht erfolgreich ist ist es unwahrscheinlich dass man es in die formel 1 schafft
6727950 deshalb muss ich mich darauf konzentrieren in der dtm einen guten job zu machen vielleicht ist es dann m glich aber selbst wenn das nicht der fall sein sollte ich bin gl cklich dass ich ein professioneller rennfahrer und in der dtm bin
6727951 nat rlich habe ich die chance den titel zu holen das h ngt aber ganz davon ab wie die letzten rennen laufen wie unser paket funktioniert und ob ich das maximum aus dem paket herausholen kann es ist nicht einfach der wettbewerb in unserem eigenen team ist gro und mit audi nat rlich auch es ist hart aber ich denke ich habe so gute chance wie die anderen auch
6727952 immature of me to talk to my mom at school
6727953 there has been a prevalent trend towards stagnant pay increases for several years
6727954 he tenido muy buena sensaci n lo conoc a por v deos de las carreras de hace un mes de gt y f3 de los planos que ten a pero caminando he confirmado la idea que ten a
6727955 dif cil denominarlo urbano es un semi permanente normal y corriente pero con las vallas pegadas en las rectas es el polo opuesto a m naco
6727956 diferente a m naco o a lo que ser singapur
6727957 hay tramos ciegos pero en teor a las banderas amarillas tendr an que ayudar en caso de que en una curva que no pudieras ver a la salida si hay alguien parado
6727958 del mismo modo continu hay partes que se estrechan bastante como la zona del puente pero son los riesgos y trampas que tiene todo circuito urbano m naco no permite ning n error y valencia pese a ser m s ancho menos bacheado y estar todo m s calculado no va a permitir tampoco errores esa es la salsa de los circuitos urbano
6727959 sorprendentemente tienen m s miedo a las arrugas y a las manchas cut neas que al c ncer de piel
6727960 se tumban al sol deber an ser m s sensatos
6727961 el sol es como el agua esta ltima es buena pero cuidado porque te puedes ahogar
6727962 a partir de septiembre veremos en mayor medida casos de alteraci n de la piel por la exposici n continuada en verano
6727963 existe un perfil de chicas j venes que est n en la playa durante muchas horas seguidas
6727964 toman el sol sin parar y no se pierden las horas de m s exposici n es decir entre las 12 00 y las 16 00 horas aproximadamente
6727965 es un t rmino reciente que a n no est muy extendido
6727966 cuando una persona no puede dejar de hacer una cosa que no es vital ni b sica que no est dentro de las necesidades primarias s que estamos hablando de un problema y es el caso de esta obsesi n por el sol
6727967 it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival here
6727968 there has been no opportunity to put forward why he was innocent of those crimes for which he was convicted in vietnam
6727969 he did not commit the offences for which he was convicted in vietnam
6727970 it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his defence forward ultimately he wants that to be tested if he can before the courts of this country
6727971 the result will be a shock to the markets and is likely to push sterling and the ftse lower and bond prices higher in trading today
6727972 it seems that brown and darlings more generous interpretation of their fiscal rules has kept the uk out of contraction for now
6727973 the news brings to an end 64 quarters of consecutive growth and increases the likelihood that the bank of england will move to cut rates before the new year
6727974 ive noticed the smell more over the last two years the smoke seems to be dropping quite regularly down to ground level
6727975 the other week it was a nice sunny day and my garden just became full of what looked like fog
6727976 the smell is sulphur like lots of people i speak to notice it maybe i should move house but ive had it converted for my disabled son so i dont see why i should move i have complained to lafarge and they have invited me down to see their processes
6727977 like our five other uk works our operation is visible in the local landscape and tightly regulated
6727978 this exemption holds cemex to stringent standards as it conducts these tests
6727979 we dont want them to burn whole tires we dont believe they are properly combusted
6727980 some people were raising the question of whether the quarry use is the same as what we call in the zoning sand gravel and crushed stone operation
6727981 we dont use the word quarry in the zoning code and we dont define those terms either
6727982 at first i thought it was a joke then i was astonished and horrified
6727983 the design of the plant is not all that different than that proposed six years ago however the design engineer is redoing all the detailed plans which includes building modifications lower profile structure an enclosed plant and different batching
6727984 we are resolving and removing final conditions on the approval in principle which have to do with the environment traffic and air quality
6727985 they must now complete the work to fulfill and update the remaining conditions of the approval in principle this work includes noise and air quality monitoring as well as traffic impacts and marine habitat studies
6727986 the vfpa will work with lafarge to prepare for final approval of the project all conditions of lafarges approval in principle issued in 2002 still apply new proposal elements will be subject to an environmental assessment process in accordance with the act
6727987 we are disappointed but what can we do they are going in because of a supreme court ruling we have to live with it now
6727988 the good thing is that now the port has stricter regulation in terms of dust and noise
6727989 bruce willmer and a lafarge engineer said the plant would be enclosed and smaller than previously planned but they were short on specifics we will have to wait and see
6727990 staff knew there had been ongoing problems with neighbours and court proceedings but its still a shock
6727991 its a bad time of year to be looking for this type of work most contractors take on staff when the weather warms up at the end of the year i might have to dust off my passport
6727992 the detailed controls in redvales resource consents were agreed to by the company and are aimed at reducing the impact of its quarrying operations on neighbours
6727993 redvales neighbours believed those controls were not being adhered to they applied for enforcement orders from the environment court requiring redvale to comply strictly with the terms of its consents the council supported those orders in part
6727994 one adjoining property owner turned down a 15 000 air conditioner as part of a package including ventilation and float glass windows that redvale had offered to the court they held out for a very expensive unit knowing we would have to come to the party
6727995 the councils issues arise primarily from the complaints of two adjoining residents which i believe are unfounded i have seen the noise monitoring data for example and in all cases they are below the limits imposed by the court and in the district plan but still they complain
6727996 previous applications have taken up to eight months and more to process
6727997 workers would have been jobless until the new consents were issued
6727998 a recent inspection by the district council found that the operation didnt have all necessary land use consents the company has applied to the regional council to vary its conditions of consent this application has been put on hold while the issues with the district council are resolved
6727999 for a concrete mix design to be considered for the ef technology award it must utilize alternative materials including recycled industrial by products that reduce the carbon footprint of the construction project and divert waste materials from disposal facilities
6728000 by utilizing our proprietary ef technology basf was able to eliminate between 100 and 300 pounds of carbon dioxide per cubic yard of concrete thus reducing the overall amount of greenhouse gas emissions in this project
6728001 we are proud to work with our valued customers like u s concrete to help construct innovative and durable buildings while making our planet a better place to live
6728002 at first i thought it was a joke then i was astonished and horrified
6728003 des ann es de travail et voil une m daille de bronze de merde
6728004 they go they vanish people civilizations languages philosophies works of art disappear species are extinguished books are lost sities drown things once thought immortal suddenly arent there at all train compartments snuff galoshes paintings dreams and innocence music a glossary of the missing a cabinet of absent curiosties
6728005 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
6728006 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
6728007 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
6728008 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
6728009 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
6728010 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
6728011 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
6728012 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
6728013 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
6728014 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
6728015 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
6728016 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
6728017 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
6728018 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
6728019 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
6728020 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
6728021 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
6728022 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
6728023 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
6728024 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
6728025 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
6728026 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
6728027 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad
6728028 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011 said mr hammoud
6728029 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this he added
6728030 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6728031 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011 said mr hammoud
6728032 its really weeded out the little guy thats building on a limited budget
6728033 hes not going to be able to afford to stay in the sport
6728034 i get calls every day asking about the price if they dont like mine they go down the road and call the next guy
6728035 for a while more people brought in cars but the regulations are tough
6728036 i just like to see the cars crashing the excitement of whos gonna stop and have to sit there and wait whether theyre gonna get squished or not
6728037 its kill or be killed and you destroy him or he destroys you
6728038 nobody should avoid taking a statin because of concerns about cancer
6728039 as you get older the vaccine becomes less cost effective
6728040 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6728041 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6728042 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6728043 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6728044 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change
6728045 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
6728046 we urge beneficiaries to choose wisely when selecting their drug coverage
6728047 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress
6728048 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6728049 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6728050 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6728051 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6728052 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6728053 we are currently doing extensive testing with irradiation and it looks to be very promising
6728054 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6728055 there is no residue theres nothing left and certainly no radioactivity left
6728056 urinary arsenic reflects exposures from all routes air water and food which makes it difficult to track the actual source of arsenic exposure let alone use the results from this study to establish drinking water standards
6728057 condemns any provocative action in this sensitive area no matter where it comes from
6728058 our position is well known that the issue of opening the limnitis crossing point is not linked to any other issue
6728059 we are keeping this priority and are working in the direction of opening the specific crossing point the soonest possible because it will serve both greek cypriots and turkish cypriots
6728060 significant preparation has already been made and we believe that soon we will have some developments
6728061 we are ready to work and we are working in this direction so that the crossing point can open soon or at least secure the decision to open the crossing point
6728062 what are you reading what did you last read whos your favourite author are all standard first date questions and what better way to find your life partner than over a shared love for lawrence or a passion for pynchon
6728063 we knew there was an opportunity for this type of service for our audience and the penguin community provides the perfect forum to meet a likeminded special someone however to create this new service successfully we wanted to partner with the world leaders in online dating to ensure we could provide the best quality of experience
6728064 i absolutely love it its so gossipy and superficial its amazing

6728068 i think that the deeper opportunity the greater opportunity film can offer us is as an exercise of the mind but an exercise i hate to use the word i wont say soul i wont say soul and i wont say spirit but that it can really put our deepest psychological existence through stuff it can be a powerful exercise it can make us think but i dont mean think about this and think about that the very very process of powerful thinking in a way that it can afford is i think very very valuable i basically think that the mind is not complete yet that we are working on creating the mind okay and that the higher function of art for me is its contribution to the making of mind

6728076 we will move from singur whatever the cost to protect our people

6728087 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
6728088 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail it s a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
6728089 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
6728090 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when it s very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
6728091 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself
6728092 my ministry and the government extend full support and recognition to the initiative and we are confident that it will go a long way in promoting the cause of indian art and artists globally
6728093 there is a lot to see paintings sculptures very good photography and even better video the importance of the electronic media is growing among the younger lot of contemporary artists and there are very art oriented films being made in india
6728094 these rat model tumours were developed from human glioblastoma cells and closely mimics human tumours in growth patterns and response to therapy
6728095 the concept of targeting blood vessels that feed tumours as an approach to limit tumour growth is not a novel idea
6728096 however blocking the specific fatty acid described in this study is novel and holds great promise for use in humans
6728097 if survival time could be extended with a combination of surgical therapy and infusion with similar drugs this could be a significant treatment option
6728098 there is now incontrovertible evidence that marketing of tobacco and the depiction of smoking in the movies promote youth smoking and can cause young people to begin smoking

6728107 the commercial impact is bad everything looks fine on the surface because we make it look fine
6728108 but behind the scenes the money side is very difficult i dont know how an independent shop would cope when the post office closed
6728109 but we are determined to turn it around for the sake of what is a centre of the community
6728110 we have taken this on and are looking to serve the community
6728111 i really worry that so many people will lose their link with the wider world if the shop goes
6728112 trade i would say has dropped by a half and people still come in with parcels and things

6728352 one desire has been the ruling passion of my life one high motive has acted like a spur upon my mind and soul and sooner should i seek escape from the sacred necessity that is laid upon me let the breath of life fail me it is this that in spite of all worldly opposition gods holy ordinances shall be established again in the home in the school and in the state for the good of the people to carve as it were into the conscience of the nation the ordinances of the lord to which the bible and creation bear witness until the nation pays homage again to god

6728370 it is a consensus that the moa will be signed but the government has not yet given anyone the authority to sign the moa since wala pang there is no go signal from the government to sign the moa even if it has been signed it will not be binding

6728372 how many participated in the three plebiscites for inclusion in the armm dont you think that is enough consultation done by the government regarding the inclusion
6728373 they have been consulted three times they said yes but are overwhelmed by the rest of the province
6728374 in the last two plebiscites the subject matter was armm autonomous region in muslim mindanao right
6728375 and armm the organic act of armm does not provide that the armm will have its internal police security force its own courts its own comelec correct

6728377 your prayer is mandamus that you be given a copy of the moa ad and prohibit the government from entering into the agreement correct

6728447 we understand the frustration caused when customers are without service and we sincerely apologize to all those persons who were affected
6728448 we continue to do all we can to avoid outages and to quickly restore power when failures occur reliability remains our key focus
6728449 cucs electrical and mechanical equipment as with all such equipment is subject to unpredictable failure or fault despite very high specification and maintenance standards the recent frequency of failure is coincidental and is in no way indicative of underlying reliability issues
6728450 system reliability has exceeded 99 96 percent on average in recent months and it has been several months since comparable outages have occurred cuc believes that historical reliability standards which are high compared to other caribbean countries and comparable to north america are sustainable
6728451 i have been following the olympics quite keenly and am sorry i couldnt have been there but we all have a lot to cheer about the caribbean has done well and jamaica has just surpassed anything we could have imagined
6728452 i am particularly pleased with how we the cayman islands have done its a pity that ronald forbes fell because i think he would have done well in the finals and cydonie is a seasoned athlete that we always have high hopes for both of the swimmers did good jobs in their individual heats and are still very young and have tremendous potential
6728453 i havent missed a minute of the olympics the caribbean has shined tremendously it is not only an achievement for jamaica but for the caribbean on a whole
6728454 for a little place like the cayman islands to reach as far as they have with ronald forbes and cydonie mothersill they must be proud
6728455 the whole island of jamaica can fit into the king ranch in texas and cayman can fit into a parish of jamaica so we must big ourselves up
6728456 it is remarkable what is happening the number of the caribbean athletes that have made it to the finals and semi finals should be emphasised the 2008 beijing olympics should be a motivating factor for not only the athletes of the caribbean but all the people this is just great

6728460 they could be hotter than 930 degrees fahrenheit and if they are that hot they will probably have quite different chemistry and life forms we expect to find new species
6728461 if we are going to use its resources responsibly then we need to understand what determines its pattern of life
6728462 in july of 2007 we bought material from him it was 800 cubic yards of material and as soon as we found out the dubious nature of the operation we immediately ceased doing any business with him and we have not done any since nor do we have any intention of doing any more with him
6728463 we were receiving three to four thousand yards a day and they supplied 800 yards over the course of a week so they were a very small portion of the whole project
6728464 planning department has acknowledged that the quarry is illegal and have issued a stop order on all work done on it but cannot apparently keep up with the inspection demands it is i am sure you will agree wholly wrong for the nra to be obtaining fill from this quarry also since it is being run contrary to the law the businesses of white rock investments will have been unable to obtain a business license i imagine
6728465 there must have been well over a thousand trucks going in and out during the course of the operation i mean these were huge trucks
6728466 between the end of july 2006 and the end of august 2006 there were several occasions of contact both in person and through emails between the planning department and the landowner where the details of the situation were discussed at that point the land owner had not taken steps to comply with the conditions of approval nor had an application for planning permission been submitted to vary the approval to allow a different usage

6728469 how wrong we were only goes to show the passion that is out there in cayman for cycling events rain or shine
6728470 this is a keen long term goal of the committee to get the youth of cayman involved in this fantastic sport imagine if we could send a youngster to the next olympics
6728471 bring the kids out and we promise to train and motivate them in this hard but rewarding sport you dont need too fancy or expensive a bike to start just passion and commitment
6728472 some of these vendors want to sell food while others want to sell non perishable items
6728473 this we have no problem with as there needs to be variety at the market which caters for everyone i may be retired and have settled in cayman brac but this is no means of generating surplus funds
6728474 the idea is to establish a market where people can purchase fresh produce and other items at their leisure at competitive prices
6728475 this will provide an avenue for residents to meet and also extend their hospitality to visitors adding another dimension to the tourism industry
6728476 once the planning board approves the paper work then the community will see more action on the ground
6728477 we look forward to any input that the public may have to make this venture successful
6728478 i have been travelling to the brac and conducting these camps for several years the reception has always been good and the kids are well disciplined
6728479 these boys have been in my camp on the brac from age ten and i have monitored them closely and the hard work of the brac coaches have played a major part in their development
6728480 coach gillie has continued to be a mentor to me for several years and i was a trainee under him for
6728481 it was a good outing and the athletes are looking forward to a next clinic in september
6728482 if persons are cognizant of certain mitigating factors that often contribute to road accidents then i think they will act more responsible especially young persons who are more often than not the group reported for going over the prescribed limit
6728483 our role in the community is not just to prosecute but to edify the members on all facets of the law so that the community can remain safe for our children and everyone
6728484 lack of experience maturity and a pre disposition to taking risks make teens the most vulnerable category of road users hence educating is one stringent method to combat this ordeal
6728485 it is an issue that will be given thought and a decision to be taken in the near future
6728486 our motto is service above self and so i believe that as a club we can meet our objectives to improve the lives of our children to keep them safe and to invest in their future together we can make dreams real
6728487 our desire is to get this process started as quickly as possible and hopefully the final document will be made public for the next issue of the bracker
6728488 i have two older brothers one who lives in brisbane australia and the other in manchester england where my family are originally from
6728489 in november 2007 i moved to maples finance where i am vice president of investment funds after doing a degree in mathematics i knew i would end up working with numbers i most enjoy working closely with clients and building that relationship

6728492 ich mag die strecke in misano wirklich und ich wei dass ich dort gut sein kann das habe ich voriges jahr mit platz zwei gezeigt
6728493 ich muss weiter pushen da ich wei dass ich konkurrenzf hig sein kann und meine crew und suzuki machen alles damit sie sicherstellen dass wir die leute vorne von beginn des wochenendes an fordern k nnen
6728494 wir haben ein paar wirklich positive dinge beim test gefunden die uns f r den rest der saison und in zukunft helfen werden es war toll auf dem podium zu stehen aber ich wei ich kann noch mehr herausholen und das muss der n chste schritt sein

6728500 the cayman team are having the time of their life our athletes have been phenomenal and they have set personal bests and national records there are 204 countries here and they are meeting a lot of people from all different countries the whole cayman islands team are goodwill ambassadors for the country
6728501 the pins are extremely popular everyone wants a parrot pin
6728502 the chinese have gone all out to show to the world they are ready to compete at the highest level with everyone and they themselves have dominated in a number of sports they are showing they are ready to compete with the usa and australia and they now have the facilities to train their people
6728503 any time you can get a personal best in the olympics it is something to be proud of
6728504 i know shaune was somewhat disappointed at not getting to the semi finals but the competition at this meet was as good at it gets and its given him the motivation to improve his placing and his time for 2012 in london
6728505 for brett this is his first olympics and this is definitely a great experience for him like his coach says he is a diamond in the rough and he certainly has some good years ahead of him
6728506 my father roy forbes has been the biggest influence on me so far
6728507 he instilled in me my work ethic but there are too many people in the cayman islands who have inspired me to name them all
6728508 they have not garnered all the skills they need but this is a good start
6728509 the training exercise allowed us to apply that theory in real world situations and under pressure
6728510 their tact and diplomacy was of a high calibre and they ensured everyone understood what was being taught before they moved on to another topic or exercise
6728511 this was a significant achievement as the department continues on the path of improving and developing the skills of the officers
6728512 mr connor is now able to manage a crew on shift and the next phase of his development will allow him to reach the level of a watch commander
6728513 we do treat every report from the airport as high risk and top priority as we are dealing with the safety of people
6728514 myself and my family received a lot of flak from some of the community about how it was done and why we made an issue of it that was very tough on all of us
6728515 the events have taken a huge toll not just in a financial sense but in a mental and business sense as well the impacts have been upsetting on many levels
6728516 ive been approached by a number of people about similar situations but of course there are strict time frames to launch the action and have it dealt with many have potentially missed that time
6728517 council might say that this is the only one but there are more around i would have to think
6728518 i wouldnt say its a nice situation at the moment there is no real acknowledgement of each other is probably the best way to put it that is difficult for both of us and again i dont thing council fully realises the impact of that
6728519 ich hoffe wir k nnen in misano ein besseres wochenende haben obwohl ich dort voriges jahr pech hatte als mich ein anderer fahrer randy de puniet in der ersten kurve runter geschmissen hat

6728536 the highest number of racers at the moment is actually people aged around 40 years old thats really the strongest age group all aspects of bmx racing lends itself to being a family orientated sport because you have people young and old participating at the same time and of course at the same facility

6728539 we have been hit three times in the last month twice at the summit and once at the federal falls
6728540 we had only just repaired the previous damage to the summit toilets when they were vandalised again
6728541 the gates were locked so it happened when there was snow on the mountains
6728542 public money and effort has gone into building these toilet blocks to make a visit to the park a more enjoyable experience and now we have spend more money and effort to repair the damage just because of the malicious and thoughtless actions of a few individuals
6728543 the figures are firming up there will always be a variation but it is totally irresponsible for councillors to instigate a scare mongering campaign this is a responsible council that has made the decision for orange to have a sustainable water supply into the future
6728544 we then expect the stormwater harvesting scheme to be operational by march which can yield 2200 mega litres a year

6728822 when a republican wears a little american flag lapel pin what is he trying to say
6728823 why did the vietnamese shoot down john mccain and put him in prison for five years he seems like such a nice guy
6728824 mccains sacrifice had nothing to do with protecting the united states he was sent to vietnam along with hundreds of thousands of others in an attempt to prop up what was essentially an american colony south vietnam which was being run by a dictator whom we installed
6728825 that had we taken the war to the north and made full consistent use of air power in the north we ultimately would have prevailed
6728826 is it morally right to drop bombs and missiles in a heavily populated area where hundreds if not thousands of civilians will perish
6728827 because johns father was the naval commander in the pacific theater he was exploited with tv interviews while wounded
6728828 i can verify that john has an infamous reputation for being a hot head he has a quick and explosive temper that many have experienced first hand folks quite honestly that is not the finger i want next to that
6728829 they were godless communists my friends they deserved to be bombed bombed bombed
6728830 liked to pass out on opium and heroine in the dead blackness of night
6728831 one of the biggest assertions that attempts to make mccains biography bullet proof is the claim that he is a genuine american hero this is of course based upon his harrowing years as a pow during the vietnam war never mind that he was participating in an illegal war by dropping bombs on a country with mostly agricultural peasants if he had been put into an american prison for refusing to follow unconstitutional orders citing the nuremberg war crime trials as precedent he would be a hero but not in the republican party

6728837 this is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation

6728839 in universe we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humor while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home above all we believe the stargate itself remains an enduring icon with infinite potential as a jumping off point for telling stories

6728842 i think the finish is quite good and if one goes for sectors which are not been affected by the markets downtrends of the last eight tern days those would be safe enough holds that would be primarily pharma and technology technology not all the stocks but some of the midcaps and

6728847 i think infosys and technology midcaps the reason i am picking these is because essentially if the market goes down on monday because of global cues technology would hold out so the downside risk is limited
6728848 same goes to an extent for the pharma particular stocks like divis lab which have been sideways at worst
6728849 cairn india has got a bit of momentum back again not so much today but overall after the petroleum price decline its not been doing that well but its bounced back a bit not
6728850 as far as ntpc is concerned its been a neutral story which means its running flat within a range neither going up or down but at least the decline we had seen in it seems to be coming to an end so thats good news on ntpc but its not a very exciting stock at the moment
6728851 on the momentum upmove the real estate sector and the capital goods sector would be two clear beneficiaries of any attempt by the market to get back to the 5 000 level and therefore the leading stocks out there like unitech or a dlf and a larsen amp toubro or a bhel would be tremendous beneficiaries the interest rate sectors particularly in the auto sector we like maruti and mahindra amp mahindra tremendously because we believe that both have a business model which is tailor made for current time which essentially will be consumer surplus middle class which will benefit from the government largest by way of the recent pay commission report with the monsoon having been fairly normal we also expect the rural india to benefit from fresh cash availability as such mahindra amp mahindra also becomes a good buy given the problems on the crude price we expect maruti to be relatively a bigger beneficiary and therefore maruti and mahindra amp mahindra choose themselves
6728852 in the momentum space amongst the banking sector we are not unduly perturbed about the credit offtake volumes and interest margins there will be some amount of fears on inflation and therefore interest and liquidity caps by the rbi but except for the fear on npas and the accounting treatment for the agricultural loan waivers we are not unduly worried about the bottomline in the banking sector therefore like i said contrary to popular perception we believe that good banks like an axis bank or even an icici bank or state bank of india and punjab national bank would be an excellent buys in this space on a slightly longer term approach we continue to like the media space particularly the blend of retail entertainment and real estate which is the multiplex space and adlabs will be our key pick out there

6728859 charlie chaplin could do a better job of running the home office than this labour government
6728860 the home office is entrusted with a great deal of highly confidential material and it seems to be entirely incapable of keeping it secure and the consequences are very serious theyre serious because it may lead to the identity of the people involved being revealed
6728861 one of the possible consequences is that criminals will bring legal actions against the government and the taxpayer will then have to pay damages to people who appear to be pretty undeserving because of the governments incompetence
6728862 if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies that are meant to do research for you then you need to be absolutely certain that when you give such information away the company concerned have put into practice procedures that are just as robust as the procedures that i hope the government has followed since the loss of the child benefit data
6728863 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses more personal information has been reported lost it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
6728864 the home office has informed us that an internal report will be carried out into the data security arrangements between the home office and its contractor pa consulting

6728888 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
6728889 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
6728890 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
6728891 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
6728892 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
6728893 but what was really cool is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frog and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals
6728894 our findings suggest that msc therapy could become a useful treatment for inflammatory bowel disease
6728895 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
6728896 the intestine may be an ideal site for msc therapy given its rapid ability to regrow tissue and its extensive local supply of lymph nodes and the route by which the cells were administered may have ensured a greater amount of engraftment in gut associated lymph nodes
6728897 before we can think about testing this approach in patients we need to know more about long term effects of msc infusion including immunosuppressive effects and gain more understanding of how mscs modulate immune cell activity in more realistic models of inflammatory bowel disease
6728898 this research project will greatly enhance our understanding of the exact relationship between dietary distillers grains and e coli 0157 h7 in cattle as well as provide us with an opportunity to look at novel ways to mitigate the potential risks of feeding this valuable co product

6728904 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain in the body
6728905 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population
6728906 however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6728907 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity

6728975 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

6728984 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6728985 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6728986 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6728987 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6728988 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6728989 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6728990 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6728991 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6728992 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6728993 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6728994 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6728995 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6728996 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6728997 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline

6729000 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6729001 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6729002 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6729003 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6729004 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6729005 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6729006 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6729007 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6729008 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6729009 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6729010 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6729011 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6729012 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6729013 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6729014 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6729015 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6729016 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6729017 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

6729025 people are still tolerant but there is a growing suspicion among muslims of others
6729026 the state has some responsibility for this growing intolerance namely by not upholding the law
6729027 how can you study here i only followed 20 per cent of my last lesson its difficult to concentrate
6729028 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6729029 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6729030 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6729031 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6729032 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6729033 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6729034 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6729035 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6729036 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6729037 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6729038 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6729039 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6729040 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6729041 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6729042 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6729043 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6729044 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6729045 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6729046 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6729047 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6729048 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6729049 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6729050 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6729051 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6729052 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6729053 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

6729059 this will be the most difficult game for us at the olympics
6729060 spain are a very complete team in every aspect defense offense outside shooting rhythm of the game rebounds intimidation
6729061 spain have 10 or 12 quality players that can decide a game
6729062 hes a kid of 17 whos already bringing lots of things to the team and i am a great admirer its going to be interesting to see him grow up
6729063 lithuania has improved a lot with respect to the team we faced earlier this summer in the preparations
6729064 jasikevicius has improved in form and with his quality he is incredible
6729065 the rest of the team is in good form they are a physical team and have good shooters
6729066 spain is a very good team and we expect a tough challenge
6729067 in preparation we lost to them by a lot but we want to play against spain we are ready
6729068 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6729069 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6729070 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6729071 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6729072 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6729073 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6729074 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6729075 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6729076 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6729077 who are open to doing something on the production side
6729078 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6729079 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6729080 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6729081 eligibility has already been investigated by authorities in the international federation
6729082 if the athletes hadnt been cleared they wouldnt have participated
6729083 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig the international gymnastics federation and ioc
6729084 an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6729085 i hope my county will win gold medals but the rest of the world must be convinced
6729086 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6729087 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6729088 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6729089 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6729090 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6729091 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6729092 quedarme en el real madrid no es mi objetivo para la pr xima temporada respeto mucho al club a los jugadores y principalmente a la afici n que siempre me ha tratado bien pero no es mi objetivo tengo una propuesta buena para mi y para el club tambi n y mi objetivo la pr xima temporada no es seguir en el real madrid

6729096 ha habido muchos casos similares a la inversa con el real madrid de protagonista sin ir m s lejos su salida del santos o recientemente el caso de cristiano ronaldo
6729097 ya le dije eso al presidente a los directivos y al entrenador tambi n que no es mi objetivo seguir en el real madrid cada jugador tiene una personalidad yo tengo la m a y no lo hab a hablado con la prensa para evitar pol micas
6729098 ahora estoy diciendo la verdad quiero salir y tengo la personalidad de decir por la prensa que no tengo el objetivo de quedarme en el real madrid agradezco a la afici n su cari o a los jugadores con los que tengo una amistad para toda la vida pero mi objetivo la pr xima temporada es jugar la premier league
6729099 mi relaci n con el entrenador y los jugadores es la mejor posible tuve la suerte de tener unos compa eros buenos que siempre me han tratado bien tengo un cari o enorme por todos los jugadores sin excepci n ninguna extranjeros y espa oles por schuster tambi n me parece un entrenador excelente con quien nunca tuve un problema no tengo nada malo que hablar de los jugadores ni del entrenador
6729100 sino que quiero resolver mi situaci n lo m s r pido posible
6729101 a partir del momento que el entrenador me pone a jugar lo hago al cien por cien primero porque llevo una camiseta por detr s una afici n que exige mucho segundo porque en el campo es mi imagen que transmito a los dem s y tercero por toda la plantilla porque si voy flojo a un bal n est perjudicando a toda la plantilla y eso no me gusta cuando entro para jugar lo hago a tope unas veces me sale y otras no pero juego a tope siempre
6729102 es que los directivos entiendan mi situaci n resolverla lo m s r pido posible pero yo voy a seguir como profesional que soy nunca he faltado a ning n entrenamiento del real madrid he entrenado todos los d as y voy a seguir haci ndolo sobre jugar no s si voy a jugar o no principalmente porque si las cosas no me salen bien la gente puede decir que no me salen porque estoy con la cabeza all para evitar ese tipo de comentario es mejor que schuster ponga a otros jugadores
6729103 intent dar el m ximo de m claro que estoy pensativo y quiero que se resuelva todo lo m s r pido posible pero cuando entro al campo me intento olvidar de todo lo que pasa fuera e intento dar el m ximo
6729104 por la calle caminando tambi n me puedo doblar el tobillo y lesionarme lo que me preocupa es el pensamiento de la afici n que piensen que no juego bien porque tengo la cabeza en el chelsea en este momento es mejor que no juegue y que resuelvan mi situaci n lo m s r pido posible

6729209 er worden miljoenen verdiend door beheerders van tikfoutsites als sesamstaat nl en nikkelodeon nl
6729210 dat geld verdienen ze doordat kinderen op hun site komen door een typefout en op de links klikken naar pornosites dat vind ik schandalig
6729211 maar het is bekend dat kinderen veel tikfouten maken veel meer dan volwassenen dat maakt het probleem naar mijn mening groot ik ken ongeveer tachtig tikfoutsites maar het zouden er veel meer kunnen zijn ik word overladen met mails van ouders die nog meer voorbeelden kennen van tikfoutsites sinds dit probleem het nieuws haalde
6729212 eigenlijk zou de eigenaar van een site die kinderen als primaire doelgroep heeft alle tikfoutsites moeten krijgen als ze hun naam registreren maar dat is te omslachtig ik zie meer in het achteraf aanpakken van het probleem als de eigenaar van een tikfoutsite doorlinkt naar porno of andere zaken die niet voor kinderogen bestemd zijn moet hij zijn domein inleveren en een straf krijgen
6729213 ik verwacht van volwassenen dat zij zien dat de site niet klopt en de juiste url intypen
6729214 die moeten een oogje in het zeil houden als hun kinderen het internet op gaan bovendien kunnen ze een filter instellen waarmee een site als sesamstaat nl niet meer bereikbaar is maar sesamstraat nl wel

6729217 what women are able to do especially for buddhism is to begin to address issues of diversity in the u s
6729218 we are not a one race nation we are a multicultural society so an ability to work across the cultures and ages is an important part of leadership
6729219 this is a start to exploring who we are and what were sharing
6729220 i think that a lot can be learned from women
6729221 numerous religions have opened the door to women and they are still needing opportunities to speak out and be recognized as knowledgeable authorities and experts in their area
6729222 i think her vision is what really allowed this to happen
6729223 for her to be a spiritual leader and to be a woman and to have this vision solidified is a really positive thing in our world right now
6729224 its a fair measure of did you get growth out of every one of your students
6729225 its very exacting data its data that leaves no excuses

6729230 growing up i wanted to be a buff my whole life
6729231 now to be a captain on the team i wanted to play for all these years is definitely an honor
6729232 we dont have a lot of yellers on our team
6729233 i like that im kind of into the speak softly and carry a big stick mode
6729234 i think this team was a very good team for us to start with
6729235 i think it just kind of boosted our confidence a little bit
6729236 we have a lot of leadership and a lot of experience out there so that definitely helps
6729237 april and assistant coach denise gavaldon have been doing a lot of team building with us
6729238 weve been having team dinners and team meetings and were all really good friends we had a great dinner the other night after practice well all go out and get some food or well go to ice cream
6729239 i think that benefits us a lot personally its helped me
6729240 our goal is to be competitive in every single game and try to win every game
6729241 we have the team to be able to go up against any team and win
6729242 it is a team sport and when youve got all the girls with a common goal and the same idea of what were trying to do it helps
6729243 at o ltimo momento tentamos convencer a parte georgiana de n o tomar esse rumo desde o princ pio dissemos que esse conflito n o podia ser resolvido pela for a

6729247 it wasnt about thinking it was too much or i wasnt capable it was just that when i was playing i was not enjoying it one little bit
6729248 when steve mcclaren was appointed he rang me and asked me to return he also came down to training and asked if i fancied it
6729249 that meant a lot to me but i dont think i was ever that close that i would have said yes
6729250 i am 34 in november and hope to still be playing when i am 35
6729251 we had reached an agreement with everton for the loan of tiago all that was needed was the players agreement and that never came
6729252 we take it therefore that tiago will stay with us
6729253 the market remains closed to us regarding players coming in like we already said some time ago now
6729254 we put the last 25 000 mtvs on hold and i asked how is it that we got to this point
6729255 we are currently gathering data and information from marines returning from oif and oef
6729256 once all the data is collected and analyzed we will approach industry for possible new designs and or changes to the current body armor
6729257 would allow greater mobility with reduced thermal stress in high elevations thick vegetation and tropical environments
6729258 now the marines who are wearing the mtv repetitively dont like it so much
6729259 it is heavier it gives a little more protection that is one of the net positives with it we still need a lighter vest that gives us the same amount of protection
6729260 for the most part we think the vest has particular application in afghanistan because once again if youre climbing up and down mountains you want to be protected but you dont want to be weighed down so much that youre just going to be sapped
6729261 i like the idea of modularization as long as you had some pieces that you could add or subtract
6729262 personal protection should be just that its a personal choice at some point
6729263 a lot has to be left to the commander threats will vary in different locations
6729264 you may have a sniper threat in one place and a shrapnel threat in another you may have a commander whose force mainly rides to the fight and another one that has to climb up the side of mountains
6729265 that weve got these various types of armor vest is marvelous
6729266 the sum of our parts are much greater than the individual aspects they want to be part of something bigger than themselves theres a lot of unity and strength to this group i dont know if thats of any interest to americans but thats what theyre missing

6729270 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6729271 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6729272 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6729273 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6729274 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6729275 its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that

6729331 in order to intervene in this crucial segment access is needed and section 377 makes it difficult
6729332 as you know i was very impressed by your plans for the area and the work which has already been undertaken our boat trip provided an excellent vantage point and i look forward to seeing the project completed
6729333 it sounds like the first minister has trumped the planning committee
6729334 as head of the body which is the final arbiter on the application this is an unusual declaration of support for proposals yet to be decided by the planning committee never mind the scottish government
6729335 it is another example of the first minister treading on dangerous waters
6729336 generally speaking it is not prudent for any government minister to comment on planning applications until the process is completed alex salmond might have been better advised to hold his tongue until then
6729337 obviously when a scheme is approved it is appropriate for a first minister to say he is delighted it has got to that point but for him to intervene at this stage is a little bit previous
6729338 restrictions on public comment apply only to the planning minister or ministers engaged in the planning process while the application is before ministers

6729346 its very encouraging to know that people are impressed by my work we were told to design a parliament for the people based in a conservation area so i thought very carefully about the natural qualities my building might have to suit it to its surroundings
6729347 i wanted to keep the design subtle and sensitive so i drew on a minimal approach using materials like recycled glass aggregate and an eco roof which is both practical and sustainable

6729403 und ohne pressefreiheit vereins und versammlungsrecht ist keine arbeiterbewegung m glich
6729404 selbst in dem u ersten fall dass die bourgeoisie aus furcht vor den arbeitern sich unter der sch rze der reaktion verkriechen und an die macht der ihr feindlichen elemente um schutz gegen die arbeiter appellieren sollte selbst dann wird der arbeiterpartei nichts brig bleiben als die von den b rgern verratene agitation f r pressefreiheit versammlungs und vereinsrecht trotz der b rger fortzuf hren ohne diese freiheiten kann sie selbst sich nicht frei bewegen sie k mpft in diesem kampf f r ihr eigenes lebenselement f r die luft die sie zum atmen n tig hat

6729406 er worden miljoenen verdiend door beheerders van tikfoutsites als sesamstaat nl en nikkelodeon nl
6729407 dat geld verdienen ze doordat kinderen op hun site komen door een typefout en op de links klikken naar pornosites dat vind ik schandalig
6729408 maar het is bekend dat kinderen veel tikfouten maken veel meer dan volwassenen dat maakt het probleem naar mijn mening groot ik ken ongeveer tachtig tikfoutsites maar het zouden er veel meer kunnen zijn ik word overladen met mails van ouders die nog meer voorbeelden kennen van tikfoutsites sinds dit probleem het nieuws haalde
6729409 eigenlijk zou de eigenaar van een site die kinderen als primaire doelgroep heeft alle tikfoutsites moeten krijgen als ze hun naam registreren maar dat is te omslachtig ik zie meer in het achteraf aanpakken van het probleem als de eigenaar van een tikfoutsite doorlinkt naar porno of andere zaken die niet voor kinderogen bestemd zijn moet hij zijn domein inleveren en een straf krijgen
6729410 ik verwacht van volwassenen dat zij zien dat de site niet klopt en de juiste url intypen
6729411 die moeten een oogje in het zeil houden als hun kinderen het internet op gaan bovendien kunnen ze een filter instellen waarmee een site als sesamstaat nl niet meer bereikbaar is maar sesamstraat nl wel

6729505 jason taylor played that position for us in miami and he was the mvp of the league
6729506 fanneys got size he has a much better understanding of what hes required to do
6729507 he was very productive in the scrimmage when you have outside linebackers who have size and are productive that can be a problem for the offense
6729508 im out here to be real productive i wasnt real happy with the way i played last year i worked hard this summer and through camp i think ive taken big strides toward that
6729509 ive been setting goals i kind of looked to wallace really how his senior year went he did real well just taking care of the little things especially the pass rush
6729510 the big thing that were trying to get our players to do is how you prepare for a game

6729514 seasonal products are often over packaged and so require extra focus to minimise the packaging used as well as communicating to consumers they can recycle the packaging used
6729515 these initiatives are part of a long term sustainability programme looking at how to reduce the amount of packaging we use whilst still protecting the product and satisfying consumer needs for a gifting proposition
6729516 all nestle confectionerys selection boxes are now made from recycled board and the plastic trays are made from recycled bottles
6729517 in total there will be 231 tonnes less packaging in 2008 and there will also be on pack messages to encourage kids to recycle
6729518 major players in the seasonal confectionery industry have signed up to this group

6729520 a year of exceptionally strong commodity demand market turbulence and price risk
6729521 by bringing to bear our business diversity the full capacity of our global assets strong risk management and a significant increase in capital deployed we operated successfully in the most volatile agricultural and energy markets in decades
6729522 despite tight stocks of many agricultural commodities we maintained reliable supply chains for our customers and created value adding solutions
6729523 if markets are allowed to work todays prices can spark a supply response from farmers a rekindling of public and private investment in agriculture and in rural infrastructure will drive productivity gains

6729533 einen politischen oder traurigen film zu machen ist sicher viel einfacher als eine gut gemachte kom die leider trauen sich viel zu wenige regisseure in letzter zeit an dieses genre heran

6729547 the conservation of insect pollinators is drawing attention because of reported declines in bee species and the ecosystem services they provide this issue has been brought to a head by recent devastating losses of
6729548 wild bumble bees have also suffered serious declines and circumstantial evidence suggests that pathogen spillover from commercially reared bumble bees which are used extensively to pollinate greenhouse crops is a possible cause
6729549 more than 40 percent of h agen dazs ice cream flavors are dependent on honey bee pollination but honey is not a major ingredient in all of our ice cream
6729550 ingredients like almonds and berries are foods that are bee dependent and since h agen dazs ice cream is dedicated to remaining an all natural brand if we find some of these items difficult to source well eventually have to reexamine our flavor line
6729551 during the first three months of spillover transmission from commercial hives would infect up to 20 percent of wild bumble bees within two km of the greenhouse
6729552 does pathogen spillover from commercially reared bumble bees threaten wild pollinators

6729809 yes and all who desire to live godly in christ jesus will suffer persecution
6729810 blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you when they revile and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you you are the salt of the earth but if salt loses it flavor how shall it be seasoned it is then god for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men
6729811 you have heard it said you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy but i say to you love your enemies bless those who curse you do good to them those who hate you and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you that you may be sons of your father which is in heaven for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust
6729812 if you are reproached for the name of christ blessed are you for the spirit of glory and god rests upon you on their part he is blasphemed but on your part he is glorified but let none o you suffer as a murderer a thief an evildoer or as a busybody in other peoples matters yet if anyone suffers as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god in this matter
6729813 if you were of the world the world would love its own yet because you are not of the world but i chose you out of the world therefore the world hates you remember the word that i said to you a servant is not greater than his master if they persecuted me they will also persecute you if they kept my word they would keep yours also but all things will they do to you for my names sake because they do not know him who sent me if i had not come and spoken to them they would have no sin but now they have no excuse for their sin
6729814 father forgive them for they do not know what they do

6729833 tau is natively unfolded or floppy so in solution it moves around a lot and can adopt many different structures

6729835 are all over the place theyre so diverse that its difficult to get one measurement that describes all of the possible structures
6729836 we generated lots and lots of structures for both normal tau and a mutant form
6729837 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down

6729839 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
6729840 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location

6729846 cancellation of the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain moa ad is a painful step
6729847 the administration is sensitive to public sentiments and the president is also committed to upholding the constitution
6729848 in doing so she will seek a new agreement within the boundaries of the law set within the constitution
6729849 the president will not allow adventurism by milf forces to pressure government to sign any agreement even if it is for peace
6729850 the focus of our peace talks shall shift from armed groups to the community
6729851 shifting of focus is not abandonment of negotiations with the milf
6729852 authentic consultations with the people and not negotiations with armed groups
6729853 bringing to justice those elements responsible for the pillage and raids and acts of banditry
6729854 as far as the milf leadership is concerned the moa ad is already a done deal

6729957 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6729958 this lack of knowledge of provider conscience law within the health professions can be detrimental to conscience and other rights particularly for individuals and entities with moral objections to abortion and other medical procedures
6729959 the proposed regulations and secretary leavitts public comments about them leave the door open as to whether institutions and individuals can deny access to contraception
6729960 while the rules are not identical to the draft proposal being circulated by hhs last month the agency interprets existing conscientious objection laws so broadly that it could result in women not receiving information they need to make informed healthcare decisions
6729961 it undermines the doctor patient relationship because women will now have to question whether their health care providers are giving them complete and unbiased information and the best care possible
6729962 t he issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6729963 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement
