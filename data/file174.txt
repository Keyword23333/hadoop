1740012 lo que hacen es aislar al pa s del camino democr tico al intentar modificar el texto de la carta magna de manera irregular y violentar de manera grave los derechos fundamentales de los venezolanos
1740013 rechazamos la decisi n de la sala constitucional del tsj sobre la constitucionalidad del articulo 105 de la ley de contralor a pues con ella se coloca a espalda de la constituci n nacional y se convierte en c mplice necesario del sistem tico proceso de destrucci n de la democracia la institucionalidad y del estado de derecho que se est adelantando en nuestro pa s
1740014 los magistrados de la sala constitucional una vez m s han actuado como activistas pol ticos afectos al oficialismo en lugar de administrar justicia como es su obligaci n legal y tica colocando de lado los m s altos intereses patrios y democr ticos pisoteando la legalidad aplastando los derechos de los venezolanos a elegir los gobernantes que deseen y convirti ndose en un ente supra constitucional capaz de modificar el texto de la carta magna de manera caprichosa y atenciones rdenes expresas de hugo ch vez
1740015 en este momento se est adelantando en medio de un agavillamiento de los poderes p blicos de nuestro pa s un gigantesco fraude al pueblo venezolano cuando se pretende imponer v a decretos habilitantes la reforma constitucional que fue rechazada por el pueblo venezolano el pasado 02 de diciembre
1740016 evaluar el estatus de las relaciones bilaterales y se profundizar la cooperaci n y la amistad que los dos pa ses se han comprometido a fortalecer
1740017 es interlocutoria es decir no definitiva no abarca el fondo es una decisi n de tr mite en la que se est resolviendo una solicitud que hicimos el pasado jueves con el prop sito de que se dictara una medida cautelar para permitir la pronta inscripci n de uzc tegui ante el consejo nacional electoral
1740018 sigue pendiente el fondo por lo tanto estamos a la espera de esa decisi n
1740019 para el alcalde l pez s ya hay una sentencia definitiva se pone fin al proceso y se declara sin lugar el recurso de nulidad interpuesto en su oportunidad
1740020 david uzc tegui es inocente no ha cometido ning n hecho de corrupci n peculado malversaci n gen rica o espec fica en fin no se dan ninguno de los supuestos establecidos en la ley anticorrupci n ni del art culo 105 de la ley org nica de la contralor a como para administrar una sanci n de inhabilitaci n
1740021 nuestra defensa y argumento es que contrariamente a lo que han dicho funcionarios de alto gobierno de que ninguno de los inhabilitados se ha declarado inocente podemos en este caso decir que uzc tegui es inocente en los hechos por los que se le est juzgando no hubo da o alguno al patrimonio p blico y de hacerse justicia tiene que levantarse esta sanci n que injustamente se ha impuesto
1740022 generalmente un abogado que est en estas lides he mantenido una actitud positiva frente a mis alumnos no podemos perder la confianza en el estado de derecho y debemos seguir trabajando por reforzarla hay que luchar por la defensa de los derechos
1740023 y si bien esos recursos no tuvieron efectos demostraron que es importante hacer valer los derechos pedirle a las instancias del estado que act en de acuerdo a la constituci n y a la ley eso no podemos dejar de hacerlo porque el d a que renunciemos a eso habremos perdido todo incluso el sistema democr tico
1740024 no se puede descartar porque hay casos en los que no se encuentra justificaci n para estas inhabilitaciones son casos de corrupci n que s la ameritan pero no por el contralor general de la rep blica como se ha pretendido hacer sino por un tribunal previo proceso penal y previa sentencia firme
1740025 por una sola instancia sin debido proceso y muchas veces alej ndose de los hechos concretos de manera que la potestad del contralor general es muy amplia y discrecional lo que no hace descartar este tipo de situaciones por eso repito que frente a esto los abogados y profesores universitarios deben es insistir en que se haga justicia y no cansarnos de eso

1740103 he was tremendous here he kept us all on our toes and kept us doing well so hell be a big loss
1740104 its a shame that hes gone and i wish him all the best
1740105 you have to give a big thanks to bobby mimms
1740106 the most serious infectious disease challenge to global public health
1740107 safe injecting sites are not a new intervention but simply a repackaging of existing who recommended interventions such as needle exchanges etc
1740108 this is becoming more and more common and unfortunately because of the international elements involved these can be very difficult and very time consuming to investigate
1740109 no one should stay the religion they are born in everyone should die as a different religion
1740110 how sad that you have overlooked how much the evangelical church has changed its direction and is today really reaching out to help those like myself facing this worldwide pandemic
1740111 i think there were a few mike stands that stayed in the truck investigators are going to look for any elements that can help them try to find possible suspects
1740112 are there any fingerprints in the car were any elements left on the scene that might help them find possible leads in this case
1740113 the amplifiers the drum sets my bass guitar ronnys guitars thats what got stolen
1740114 igg was going off and the montreal people were pumped up
1740115 the spirt of people of coming and helping someone whos taken some blows its very kind of them
1740116 when rick and i first got involved we thought we were just two people what could we possibly do against a pandemic but as we began to travel and learn about how hiv aids is affecting different parts of the world we realized that there was a very major piece of the fight that was missing or at least under mobilized and underutilized and that is the local church
1740117 we are at this conference because we think this is where the church ought to be
1740118 what we have before us is a global pandemic and the church needs to show compassion kindness and the love of christ as part of the solution
1740119 this satellite session differed from all others during the six day biennial conference in that it focused on a revolutionary concept of transforming health care delivery through the full engagement of the local church linked to existing health care systems to work together for the common purpose of community health
1740120 both a one legged and a two legged stool will fall over but a three legged stool will stand
1740121 there is a public sector role of government and ngos there is the private or profit sector role of businesses and there is the faith sector role of churches and houses of worship
1740122 each of these sectors brings something to the table that the others dont have
1740123 if you say the faith community cannot participate in healthcare you have just taken out most of the world because the amount of those without faith in the world is very small
1740124 after 25 years hiv is still a new disease and we need new strategies tools and programs
1740125 this is all about partnership and if we partner it is because we are different not because we are the same
1740126 one of the unusual things about this partnership with rwanda is that im not in the same position to lead with the vision that the rwandans are
1740127 my role in this is much different in america i can lead as it is my mission my country and my culture but in rwanda im in fact a servant im not a minister and im not a missionary im a businessman who is trying to find significance in the second half of my life and there are many others like me
1740128 our emphasis is on sustainability and scalability not speed we are in this for the long haul
1740129 through the development of a church model the number of potential health care partners is growing from only 200 doctors to more than 1 500 trained workers two per church and more than 51 000 western rwandans are now on arv treatment
1740130 while the chinese government gets ready to invite the entire world for a big celebration theyre using their other hand to repress six million tibetans
1740131 theyre using tibetan people as dancers in the opening ceremony theyre using all kinds of propaganda to let the world think that the tibetan people are happy under chinese rule were here to tell our side and the truth
1740132 we demand that authorities and mps take effective measures immediately and punish the violation of law
1740133 so many policemen are there but they are unable to do what they should do they should immediately remove these people from our entrance
1740134 a police officer even suggested paying us 5 000 yuan us 730 if we would leave beijing for three months
1740135 weve been praying for a successful olympic games for eight years we didnt do anything wrong so why are they doing this to us
1740136 since the chinese constitution was amended in 1982 to allow freedom of religion
1740137 no mans land deportation and migration as risk factors versus protective factors for hiv infection among male and female injection drug users in tijuana mexico
1740138 with disintegrating family support networks sudden changes in a persons cultural environment homelessness and poverty were more apt to see risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with sex workers other men or sharing injection needles among male migrants however an alternate explanation could be that deportation from the united states leads to social upheaval loss of social ties and income factors which lead to engaging in high risk behaviors
1740139 the group has been facing the most challenging economic conditions for decades which has reduced operational performance and has restricted investment in the groups brands
1740140 with the exception of goldman sachs there is no other bank of our size that has been less affected by this crisis
1740141 therefore we consider the process of falling property values is not yet complete
1740142 overall the markets in which we operate remain strong and the group continues to make good progress
1740143 we believe that the wpp offer for tns generates value for wpp share owners and provides a substantial premium for tns share owners with both cash certainty and equity upside
1740144 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1740145 these issues have not been resolved xstrata believes that lonmins operations are attractive but that a significant transformation of operating and management practices is required to return lonmin to its former growth trajectory over time
1740146 xstrata believes it is uniquely positioned to realise the full potential of lonmins long life and high quality but underperforming asset portfolio
1740147 todays announcement marks the next step in our strategy to develop a significant platinum business and add further scale and diversification to our portfolio an unrivalled combination of operational synergies relevant experience and skills and a track record of turning around underperforming operations to create value position xstrata as the natural owner of the lonmin assets
1740148 honey jakes alive nothing else matters we all got back safe
1740149 only a piece of furniture we bought as a wedding gift to each other
1740150 only twenty years worth of poking around garage sales and thrift stores together dont tell me what its only okay
1740151 i can fix the cabinet that splintered door will need to be replaced but the other one just needs new hinges i can put in new glass
1740152 hey who ordered green peppers mom youve gotta quit ruining good pizza with veggies
1740153 wed better save a few pieces for the other kids
1740154 karens spending the night at out her new drivers license
1740155 we could tell them there was a burglar but then theyd want to help the police solve the case and theyd never stop asking questions
1740156 jon and anne would break out the detective kit you gave them for christmas
1740157 if we finish cleaning everything i dont think theyll pay much attention the cabinet is the only obvious damage if they ask well just say it got bumped and fell
1740158 it depends on why they came if they plan to stay in our world we need to find them stop them but my guess is that cameron wants to return to lyric with something from our world that he can use there that means theyll be back to go through the portal
1740159 ill get extra locks tomorrow maybe look into an alarm system
1740160 can you remember more about your conversations with cameron what did he ask you about what did he seem interested in
1740161 its okay honey we dont have to talk about it right now
1740162 it reminded me of summer camp and i was so tired of running and hiding in caves i finally felt safe tara fussed over me and i taught dustin and aubrey how to play soccer it felt like home
1740163 i went to see morsal plains with tara brutal the grain was all black and it smelled weird tara told me about the attack how hazor poisoned it on purpose and how susan the restorer led the army to protect braide wood
1740164 i know i lived it and its hard for me to believe
1740165 anyway i hiked back to taras house and some guys came to take me to cameron he made a big fuss over me said it was his job to welcome guests to the clans said id run into bad company but hed make it up to me he gave me something to drink and there was this lady she was amazing
1740166 i sat taller and angled away from my parents my jaw tightening
1740167 she helped me realize that no one else had ever really understood me i wanted to become a guardian i had an important job to do
1740168 the woman you met was a rhusican they poison minds dont trust everything youre feeling right now
1740169 jake they used you to find the portal she doesnt really understand you
1740170 how could i forget you made us learn the whole thing one summer o lord you have searched me and you know me blah blah blah
1740171 you know when i sit and when i rise you perceive my thoughts from afar
1740172 sounds like theres someone who understands you a lot better than cameron and medea remember that
1740173 ill get us signed up for some practice space at the fencing club
1740174 if we hide the portal stones cameron and medea wont be able to go back
1740175 we dont want them running around our world they dont belong here
1740176 i know we have to send them back but on our terms without anything that would hurt the people of the verses and what about jake
1740177 we need to keep the portal available in case hes needed there but how will we know
1740178 jane and i are very pleased to honor my father with this endowed scholarship
1740179 my father has always believed in getting a good education and in working hard to achieve your goals we are happy that we can pass this legacy on to deserving auburn students
1740180 we are grateful to mike and jane for such a thoughtful and generous investment in the auburn university college of business and our future leaders
1740181 in todays competitive environment scholarship support plays a critical role in our ability to attract outstanding students
1740182 das ist ein einzigartiges ergebnis und zeigt einmal mehr die popularit t und qualit t unserer mannschaft
1740183 wir sind gl cklich und stolz dass franck mit berw ltigender mehrheit gew hlt worden ist sein sieg ist absolut verdient
1740184 aber zizou war einmalig und ich versuche nicht ihn zu kopieren
1740185 i would say there is at least one person in every class who undergoes a huge transformation
1740186 our program is very much hinged upon art in education thats the driving force we want people to believe they can learn
1740187 we would like to develop some more painting classes possibly pastel and pottery
1740188 we have a prison that has a ceramics shop and they have kilns if we can get potter wheels then we can have a pottery class it takes more funds to get art classes like that going because art supplies are extraordinarily expensive
1740189 under kyes leadership this program has flourished and continues to provide a significant and meaningful service to the community
1740190 we are thankful for kyes outstanding dedication and grateful to the funding agencies for recognizing what a valuable program this is these grants ensure that even more will be done to introduce education and humanities to those who appreciate and need them
1740191 everyone has an ability inside of them to create and communicate
1740192 viele wollen helfen aber es ist schwer geld zu sammeln wenn die leute glauben die finnjet werde schon zerst ckelt
1740193 ich will dass amerika wei dass ich durchaus bereit bin zu f hren

1740204 se puso en riesgo la vida de los militares que participaron en la operaci n
1740205 como una acci n limpia en la que no se dispar un solo tiro
1740206 se les debe seguir considerando como unos verdaderos h roes
1740207 consumo de alcohol problemas asociados y respuestas en am rica latina

1740259 education has two purposes on the one hand to form the mind on the other hand to train the citizen
1740260 as for the manual workers they will be discouraged from serious thought they will be made as comfortable as possible and their hours of work will be much shorter than they are at present they will have no fear of destitution or of misfortune to their children as soon as working hours are over amusements will be provided or a sort calculated to cause wholesome mirth and to prevent any thoughts of discontent which otherwise might cloud their happiness on those rare occasions when a boy or girl who has passed the age at which it is usual to determine social status shows such marked ability as to seem the intellectual equal of the rulers a difficult situation will arise requiring serious consideration if the youth is content to abandon his previous associates and to throw in his lot whole heartedly with the rulers he may after suitable tests be promoted but if he shows any regrettable solidarity with his previous associates the rulers will reluctantly conclude that there is nothing to be done with him except to send him to the lethal chamber before his ill disciplined intelligence has had time to spread revolt this will be a painful duty to the rulers but i think they will not shrink from performing it
1740261 those children on the other hand who are destined to become members of the governing class will have a very different education they will be selected some before birth some during the first three years of life and a few between the ages of three and six all the best known science will be applied to the simultaneous development of intelligence and will power eugenics chemical and thermal treatment of the embryo and diet in early years will be used with a view to the production of the highest possible ultimate ability the scientific outlook will be instilled from the moment that a child can talk and throughout the early impressionable years the child will be carefully guarded from contact with the ignorant and unscientific from infancy up to twenty one scientific knowledge will be poured into him and at any rate from the age of twelve upwards he will specialize in those sciences for which he shows the most aptitude at the same time he will be taught physical toughness he will be encouraged to roll naked in the snow to fast occasionally for twenty four to run many miles on hot days to be bold in all physical adventures and uncomplaining when he suffers physical pain from the age of twelve upwards he will be taught to organize children slightly younger than himself and will suffer severe censure if groups of such children fail to follow his lead a sense of his high destiny will be constantly set before him and loyalty towards his order will be so axiomatic that it will never occur to him to question it every youth will thus be subjected to a threefold training in intelligence in self command and in command over others if he should fail in any one of these three he will suffer the terrible penalty of degradation to the ranks of common workers and will be condemned for the rest of his life to associate with men and women vastly inferior to himself in education and probably in intelligence the spur of this fear will suffice to produce industry in all but a very small minority of boys and girls of the governing class except for the one matter of loyalty to the world state and to their own order members of the governing class will be encouraged to be adventurous and full of initiative it will be recognized that it is their business to improve scientific technique and to keep the manual workers contented by means of continual new amusements as those upon whom all progress depends they must not be unduly tame nor so drilled as to be incapable of new ideas unlike the children destined to be manual workers they will have personal contact with their teacher and will be encouraged to argue with him it will be his business to prove himself in the right if he can and if not to acknowledge his error gracefully there will however be limits to intellectual freedom even among the children of the governing class they will not be allowed to question the value of science or the division of the population into manual workers and experts they will not be allowed to coquette with the idea that perhaps poetry is as valuable as machinery or love as good a thing as scientific research if such ideas do occur to any venturesome spirit they will be received in a pained silence and there will be a pretence that they have not been heard a profound sense of public duty will be instilled into boys and girls of the governing class as soon as they are able to understand such an idea they will be taught to feel that mankind depends upon them and that they owe benevolent service especially to the less fortunate classes beneath them but let it not be supposed that they will be prigs far from it they will turn off with a deprecating laugh any too portentous remark that puts into explicit words what they will all believe in their hearts their manners will be easy and pleasant and their sense of humour unfailing
1740262 education used to begin at eight years old with the learning of the latin declensions now under the influence of psycho analysis it begins at birth it is to be expected that with the advance of experimental embryology the important part of education will be found to be pre natal this is already the case with fishes and newts but in regard to them the scientist is not hampered by education authorities
1740263 in normal cases children of sufficiently excellent heredity will be admitted to the governing class from the moment of conception
1740264 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1740265 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link

1740324 if you really want to become a well known and or respected writer online you will need to have original thoughts
1740325 we should give no attention to spammers tactics cuz ignorance is bliss and so is ranking on page 53
1740326 a situation should be created where the agitation should be suspended at least for a few days so that discussion can take place to find a peaceful solution to the problem
1740327 you cannot solve a problem by undertaking protests for weeks and months together
1740328 government is doing all it can to defuse the tension but we cannot kill our children on the streets

1740339 i wouldnt piss in their ear if their brains were on fire
1740340 i have been actively seeking to advance my career for over three and a half years although re employed recently for 22 months this job failed to use my best talents and resulted in yet another layoff
1740341 i immediately went to work revising my resume according to your guidance
1740342 the company advertised my dream job on one of the big employment websites having contacted their vp of human resources within the last year i was able to send my resume directly to him rather than through the usual website channel
1740343 two days later i followed up with a phone call as you counseled and i received a telephone interview shortly thereafter with two engineers in the company this resulted in them flying me to their location for on site interviews and a tour two weeks ago
1740344 about 27 8 million americans worked from home in 2006 which was a 10 percent jump over 2005 and that number is going to continue to grow
1740345 a growing number of companies are hiring people to telecommute from home as opposed to off shoring those jobs to another country or hiring people to work in an office
1740346 ive seen it all but customer service is hot right now i think its a big growth area phone banks and order taking many of the ads you see on tv are routing their calls to home based workers so do pizza places and airline reservation firms to name a few others
1740347 i recommend people pursue a home based career by investing in themselves and upgrading their skills through education
1740348 these are red flags because there is no legitimate need for those sorts of services
1740349 who else do you know that i should be talking to
1740350 im a bargain i consistently make or save far more money than i get paid in salary
1740351 the important thing is his elbow feels fine i think he needs a few more work days like today he did a lot today and well see how he feels tomorrow
1740352 im not happy with him not running out the last ground ball last night
1740353 i didnt take him out of the game everybody was hurt last night so i had to wait until today to do it
1740354 i really dont believe in a whole lot of rules and regulations
1740355 personally i dont believe in it i like to believe that you are a man and can pretty much police yourself
1740356 i feel good considering the calendar this year which was terrorizing
1740357 right now i dont really have time to enjoy that because i want to take in the olympic games i want to take in the olympic experience its special its an experience you never forget
1740358 not one of us is up here thinking about points were only thinking about our country
1740359 what weve done this year will be difficult to repeat
1740360 its important for the spanish team for our tennis to have the best player in spanish history there to help us win
1740361 its clear im not one of the favorites but we could still have some good results
1740362 ive finally figured out what im doing with my future
1740363 its hard to train when you dont know what your next fight is affliction is a great opportunity to showcase my skills and test myself again
1740364 i fought him to a unanimous decision victory but it was a tough fight and im sure its going to be a tough fight this time but im ready im ready for anybody
1740365 it was good in the sense that i had many fights i had five fights last year and it kind of brought me back into shape
1740366 hopefully its going to lead me to the next level so thats good
1740367 it was the hardest decision of my career and im suffering a lot to have to let go of my dream
1740368 we fought during four years to get to the olympics and i wont be able to be by larissa on the court
1740369 its not easy to make this decision after so many days of suffering and sacrifice im sorry that she is not in condition to be by my side in this moment that we had dreamed so much for our careers
1740370 i tried everything grabbed all the possibilities given to me by the professionals who evaluated me but unfortunately i reached my limit
1740371 we knew that this could have happened but we always worked with the expectation that i would play
1740372 there was no more time for doubts and the decision had to me mine
1740373 i thought a lot about it and realized that it wouldnt be fair to larissa the technical staff and the brazilian people for me to play without the ideal conditions to do well in the olympics
1740374 i know some people may question why i didnt make this decision earlier
1740375 but i ask would someone give up their dream this easily without fighting until the last minute
1740376 we will release rafinha for the olympic games if the brazilian soccer association can allow him to participate at short notice
1740377 it is one of the classic clubs in this country and being in the metropolitan new york area was important to us
1740378 i know ill get the jitters a little bit when i go out there because this is my first experience
1740379 ive never seen a game never been part of one i was supposed to go to the super bowl this year but i couldnt go because i was training for the scouting combine so this is going to be exciting
1740380 theyre building a dynasty up there you have to respect what they can do
1740381 if i can do it against them i can do it against anybody
1740382 hes a rookie but gosh hes had a lot of carries his whole career as a running back hes a veteran
1740383 it will be new for him playing against an nfl defense particularly that defense it will be interesting to see how hell do but i would be surprised if hes not up to it
1740384 hes improved so much from the first time we saw him until now ill just tell him to do what he does in practice i mean hes making plays left and right
1740385 obviously hes going to get excited but i dont think the game is going to be too big for him
1740386 i think when the lights come on and he puts on those ravens silks hes going to know that its time to play football
1740387 hes going to see that the game is at a faster pace one thats faster than what he knows from college and here on the practice field
1740388 the hits do feel different im not going to lie
1740389 you cant always fight against it youve got to know when to go down sometimes if you cant get extra yards thats when you have to be careful
1740390 theres no rhyme or reason as to why were going this direction its just the way i want to go right now
1740391 i am way too slow and turns out im at least four inches shorter than i thought id be
1740392 jon fitch is the best overall fighter i have faced
1740393 if you want to get ready for a fight work with jon fitch because youll guarantee yourself youll be in shape because no one works harder than he does
1740394 the other fighters and trainers they know who i am and what im capable of doing and really having that kind of respect is the most important
1740395 people sell me short and dont know how good of a fighter i am which is fine because i dont care
1740396 i dont do this to impress other people even guys in my sport dont know who the hell i am honestly my girlfriend had a friend come up and visit her this week and he was saying how he ran into rampage at a gas station in irvine calif a week ago
1740397 he asked if he knew who jon fitch was and told rampge he was friends with me he had no idea who i was he said hed never heard of me that says a lot when you have ex champs who have never heard of me
1740398 technically it would be the biggest thing in my career of course
1740399 people spend their whole lives striving to get a title shot let alone win a title so yeah its a big deal but again im hesitant to say this but im really hard on myself and even that even being regarded as the best in the world isnt enough for me
1740400 i have to see myself as the best in the world i have to see myself as the best i can be im hesitant to say this because it will make a lot of people mad and i dont want to do that but winning the title is not as big of a deal as me achieving the goals ive set forth for myself
1740401 this sport is so competitive and there are so many good guys out there its almost impossible to win two in a row let alone eight
1740402 think of what this guy has done think of how many great fighters have fought in the ufc and havent been able to do what he has done its amazing when you think about it
1740403 he told me you know dana im not the greatest knockout artist im not the greatest athlete im not the best submission guy what i am is a grinder and i am going to grind and grind and grind and never quit
1740404 you talk about working your way up the ladder punch by punch thats exactly what this guy did
1740405 and even though hes already accomplished so much he isnt satisfied and you know what no matter what he does he never will be because he always thinks he can do more thats the kind of guy you love having fight for you
1740406 i just need to go out and throw quality strikes something i didnt do a lot before
1740407 i like the way the teams shaped up i couldnt be happier
1740408 i realize that the four picks is going to be a little more difficult than i thought theres a lot of really quality options there for me so i just like how things have played out so far
1740409 my best ryder cup was my first ryder cup i had no experience
1740410 ive said this all along that to me experience is important but it also is overrated i mean experience now anyone who has played ryder cup in the last six ryder cups has experienced getting their ass beat
1740411 i feel like i want players that are playing well and that are hot i feel like were going to probably have seven rookies on this team unless an experienced player gets hot then ill pick him im not going to pick experienced guys simply because they have experience im going to pick players that are playing well and that are very confident
1740412 i dont see one single positive that tiger woods isnt on our team
1740413 i cant imagine how you can argue a team would be better off without arguably the greatest player potentially the greatest player who has ever lived certainly the greatest player of his era
1740414 it puts europe in a i would say without question a favorite role to argue that europe wouldnt be the favorite this time around would be very difficult
1740415 i think that the system thats a one year system produces a guy that plays well that year
1740416 its going to be impossible to make the team based on last years performance alone this year
1740417 i think thats exactly how they should look at it
1740418 i believe the players will be thinking about if they really want to be on this team
1740419 were still a young culture many of us are first generation americans
1740420 the priorities for my parents werent sports they were to put bread on the table to move ahead and become good american citizens
1740421 outreach programs would make things easier for people less fortunate help the kids who have potential to maybe find the road to the next level
1740422 right now there is no road its bushwhacking your way through to the other side and most of them get lost
1740423 the parents dont know their way through the system a lot of the kids cant get scholarships as easily as african americans can
1740424 i need to find out more i dont have all the answers
1740425 we have to do more to take the fine young athletes that exist among new americans and find some ways of creating opportunities for them they are underrepresented
1740426 i did have some classmates that were discouraged by parents to play sports and many were very talented
1740427 they would start the season on a sports team and halfway through quit because they couldnt make practice they had to baby sit or run errands for their moms
1740428 in commerce more parents now see that their children can represent the u s at the olympics
1740429 the city does a good job of giving their olympians a lot of recognition so residents are forced to become familiar with the olympians and that accessibility gives them hope and encouragement

1740510 ben het met paul eens dat de artikelen van chris brogan niet onvermeld mogen blijven als het over personal branding gaat lees ook de discussies onder zijn postings over dit onderwerp bekende namen mengen zich daarin personal branding kun je niet aan personeel opleggen ze moeten het ook willen ik ken zeer deskundige mensen die nooit voor een zaal gaan staan niks willen delen op een blog en liever onder hun bureau kruipen dan optreden als wat voor spokesman van hun bedrijf dan ook de mensen die dat wel leuk vinden moet je herkennen en stimuleren mits hun profiel past bij datgene wat je als bedrijf wilt uitstralen want ook dat is niet onbelangrijk de kritiek dat personal branding al snel doorslaat in egocentrisme vind ik wat bekrompen het ademt de spruitjeslucht van doe maar gewoon dan doe je al gek genoeg natuurlijk zijn er uitwassen sommige popsterren sommige zelfverklaarde goeroes maar in beginsel is er niks verkeerds mee om jezelf te vermarkten dat hoeft ook helemaal niet agressief of pushy te gebeuren zelf was ik bijna vier jaar lang een personal brand van vakblad adformatie vooral sinds de oprichting van adfoblog dat groeit zo dat is geen bewuste strategie hoewel ik inmiddels al enkele maanden voor emerce werk zie ik nog steeds bij sommige mensen merkverwarring dat is een terecht punt dat scott willoughby hierboven maakt merken kunnen hun personal brands kwijtraken en daarmee een deel van hun zichtbaarheid wie mijn blog leest weet trouwens dat ik inmiddels zelfstandig aan het sleutelen ben geslagen met mijn personal brand merken moeten soms rebranden personal brands dus ook maar daar ga ik te zijner tijd zeker nog een langere blogposting over schrijven qua personal branding lopen we behoorlijk achter op een land als de vs dus zal er op dit vlak nog veel gaan gebeuren in nederland

1740542 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values the rules for the guantanamo military commissions are so flawed that justice could never be served from start to finish this has been a monumental debacle of american justice
1740543 the travesty of this verdict now is that had the case gone to trial in 2004 he would have been acquitted of all the charges

1740556 i really still believe and this may be somewhat naive that the legacy of these olympics is not yet finished some good may still come out of it for the majority of the chinese people its a deserved celebration and it shows how far theyve come as a nation in a very short time but i very much despise some things their government does

1740578 the white people are spoiling our land because they took part in the sass town war also if they want to challenge their involvement in liberias problem i will go deeper and speak of my experience with them as chief justice of liberia because i had some of them working with me and they were not good they came as spies on government
1740579 violence was too much during the tolbert and doe regimes even though tolbert was a good man unlike doe who was a dictator i took part in all revolutionary affairs when i served government at key positions and i did not kill anybody but i had no mercy for wrong doers
1740580 that was an interference with my job and a separate branch of government which was criminal in nature so i resigned
1740581 i had a conference with the senate and after few days i heard that though i have resigned i was impeached by the president i went to court and the late esther parker was to serve as my witness but unfortunately she was killed under the double bridge linking the freeway to gardnersville the government said that it was investigating her death and nothing ever came out of it but that was how the case ended

1740586 samantha bee i dont think you can legally call what she does journalism
1740587 john mccain is looking for someone for vice president who has more economic expertise than he does so congratulations to all of you youre on the short list
1740588 kerry is a content and happy warrior for obama hes been an extraordinarily effective surrogate on everything from finding an end to the war to beating the republican attack machine hes hit his stride on many levels
1740589 first he lost by an inch second if you saw him in the debates with bush this is a guy who is an extraordinary communicator this was true in the period leading up to iowa in 04 when very few people thought he had a chance to win i think he got shackled some by the research and the attempt to take some of the edge off after he had the nomination but in the last several weeks when he was out on the road he was terrific
1740590 when president bush and sen mccain refuse to put iraq into the broader struggle their mistakes and misstatements only build on each other
1740591 if you dont understand the surge and what happened you cant make the right judgments about the future

1740593 john doesnt mind in the least engaging as he did with lieberman he is not sitting there worrying about what people are going to think of him and he really understands the issues in a way few people in politics do there is no question that if he had not run in 04 he would almost be a lock for the vice presidential nomination thats the irony had he not run at all he would be the clearest possible choice for vp this year but it would be unprecedented to pick the person who was nominee of the party four years earlier for vice president though it would be fun if it happened some of those swift boaters would crawl out from their muck only this time they will get beaten back

1740604 school policy has been not to take seniors so in talking to the principal they just felt that that was a good policy to maintain
1740605 i didnt really have any strong feelings about it one way or another i only met the young man once i dont think we want to change policy
1740606 wherever coach bergeron ends up or where i feel comfortable thats where ill end up
1740607 there really wasnt any connection when it came down to it they dont allow seniors and we will continue with the same policy
1740608 right now im not really thinking about college just focusing on high school finishing up my senior year im pretty open to anybody right now i have no preliminary list right now
1740609 i am sorry that your air is so crappy that i have to wear a mask
1740610 deep concern about chinas human rights before he too heads to the olympics as he steps off air force one in bejing maybe he should be wearing his own smog mask if only as a sign of solidarity with this countrys athletes
1740611 they felt it was rather sexually graphic my point is it was comically graphic all the sex in the movie with the exception of one scene is very cartoonish very campy
1740612 maybe some people had bad experiences because they dont study it and dont know it

1740620 its clear to us that we do not want to be in the search engine marketing business maintaining objectivity in both search and advertising is paramount to googles mission and core to the trust we ask from our users for this reason we plan to sell the performics search marketing business to a third party we believe this will allow us to maintain objectivity and the search marketing business to continue to grow and innovate and serve its customers
1740621 we found in talking to folks that at 2 500 its a considered purchase but its of value to them

1740638 in the past when you looked at the teams on paper you could maybe say it would be close and it turned out the last two werent close at all but to argue that europe wouldnt be the favorite this time around would be very difficult

1741010 now every time i read the paper i see the democrats avoiding issues by trying to ignore them
1741011 ostriches are built so that as they bury their head in the sand a protective layer covers their ears so when they come up for air they can hear again it seems the democrats arent equipped with this mechanism and come up deaf after their sojourn to their cranial subterranean hiding place i say i say them dems crazy

1741058 the earth has been invaded by a species that take over the minds of their human hosts while leaving their bodies intact and most of humanity has succumbed
1741059 the direction we heard was that youre not looking for a slight increment in service you want a change in the paradigm a different way and different view of how transit services are delivered
1741060 the direction we heard was if such a plan could be developed the community would find a way to address the cost
1741061 and the transit authority is one way to do that
1741062 i didnt hear the group say that money is no object
1741063 im really concerned about the cost of this and im certainly concerned about taxing our citizens to do this
1741064 im very comfortable with moving forward with a transit or transportation authority without a funding capability as long as thats the game plan
1741065 the county has shown good faith in investing in more transit but i think the deal in a nutshell all along has been the city giving up control to some degree the ball is more in the countys court
1741066 while a transportation authority is broader i think its going to dilute our focus
1741067 i think a transit authority is the right way to go because the city has already bought into it and i think we have a job ahead of us to persuade the county that this is the best option for the future
1741068 if we dont get the funding mechanism this coming year then at least well be in a better position to get it the following year
1741069 its imperative that we recognize that we should move forward with a regional transit authority and we should significantly expand our transportation options for our citizens
1741070 im not in favor of a regional transportation authority per se because i think it implies a whole new level of bureaucracy and transportation planning decisions
1741071 with revenues that would accrue to local government who could then pass it on to a regional transit authority to manage this new robust system
1741072 its a community with very little car traffic and it was pretty amazing to us to see as big a city with as so few cars on the road
1741073 it included things like they werent going to allow any more vacant lots to be turned into parking
1741074 but were still rural and not a very transit available community
1741075 northern virginia tried to get a bill even introduced in the last session that would have fixed the problem created by the supreme court decision by enabling the elected officials in the localities to raise money they couldnt even get permission to get the bill introduced let alone get a vote on it
1741076 ive supported them in the past because i thought it was the only way we were going to get things done
1741077 if theres even one who is out there saying this is not a good idea this thing is going to be dead in the water
1741078 would the county be more comfortable in increasing its general fund support for transit if it had more of a stake in the management and governance of the transit system

1741084 weve got the system all there i mean the el goes right to the ohare field and right to if chicago beats out madrid rio de janeiro and tokyo next year to become the host city that would help accelerate transit work the mayor said adding he would look to the federal government for assistance

1741092 these people are going to end up with complications of their illnesses prematurely they will be disabled early they will probably die younger it is a major public health disaster
1741093 longer term there will be expensive admissions to hospitals usually through the emergency department due to diabetes out of control and congestive heart failure because of hypertension
1741094 we found some pretty striking differences when we compared uninsured individuals with one of these seven conditions with insured individuals with one of the conditions
1741095 these are conditions that we take care of in the clinic we know that we can prevent disabling complications or catastrophe if we are able to manage these conditions
1741096 it is interesting that chronic conditions are more common among people with insurance than without but that isnt surprising either people with a chronic condition are likely to place a higher value on their coverage and work harder to get and keep it
1741097 but having insurance is not likely to prove to be a panacea for these folks
1741098 people with chronic conditions who are insured are not doing so well either we do not do a very good job of delivering chronic care in this country for anyone
1741099 the states lawsuit isnt about the science of global warming and polar bears
1741100 it is merely doing the bidding of oil companies that want to drill for oil in sensitive polar bear habitat without any concern for how that oil will impact the climate when its burned
1741101 additional regulation of the species and its habitat under the endangered species act will deter activities such as commercial fisheries oil and gas exploration and development transportation and tourism within and off shore of alaska

1741108 i guess the word on the street that a lot of schools are using is that dewayne walker wont be at ucla next year

1741110 theyll write books and make movies about my time here

1741121 internet tv cmp and forbes com scramble to catch up with sys con tv
1741122 the key is not to get too far ahead of the marketplace
1741123 the supply of online video that advertisers can put advertising against is pretty scarce

1741125 that moment in victory lane i wanted to pause it and burn it into my memory forever because its such an awesome awesome feeling
1741126 i got really sick of hearing why arent you winning
1741127 but it made me look at the pit crew myself my driving style it made me look at a lot of things
1741128 this sport is like a roller coaster sometimes youre at the top and sometimes youre at the bottom
1741129 when youre down on the bottom you just have to keep working at it dont ever give up and keep trying to work your way back up to the top
1741130 sometimes you dont know how you get down to the bottom and sometimes you dont know how you get to the top theyre both the same thing its just the results are different
1741131 not so much that we havent won a race to me its more frustrating that we werent competitive to win a race theres a big difference between leading laps running good having issues and not pulling the win off than not even being close to the front or leading the laps to get the wins
1741132 its not like were not running well because we are
1741133 weve just had some circumstances that havent gone our way
1741134 at the beginning of the year we went eight races without winning and at that point i found it odd i was criticized for not winning in that period of time
1741135 it happens to different people at different times quite honestly ive been very fortunate to win all the races i have you just never know when youre going to stop winning
1741136 prostate cancer is the most common cancer affecting men in the united states
1741137 we are so pleased that the nfl player care foundation has made awareness for this disease a priority and that we can help facilitate this initiative
1741138 retired nfl players should be proud that they are taking charge of their health and serving as leaders in the community we hope that this research will encourage other men to get screened for prostate cancer
1741139 the evolution of new green collar jobs could catalyze a new generation of engineers and scientists in our nation
1741140 when used correctly backpacks are the most efficient way to carry a load and distribute the weight among some of the bodys strongest muscles
1741141 if a young athlete comes off the field after a blow to the head in any sport feeling dizzy faint or have a lapse in memory its vital that they tell their coach or a team trainer equally as important coaches trainers and parents need to be observant of head injury symptoms because athletes may not report them
1741142 but of utmost importance athletes younger than 18 who have any post blow to the head symptoms affecting their thought process should not return to the same practice game or contest and be evaluated by a physician prior to return to play
1741143 the collaborative environment of the promise clinic allows the students to make a significant contribution to the community by helping those who most need access to necessary health care
1741144 the students work at the promise clinic both in its structure and delivery of healthcare to the uninsured serves as an excellent model for other communities where access to healthcare is a concern
1741145 ultimately the continuity of care that is provided to patients is the greatest success of the clinic
1741146 the student doctor team model provides rich learning opportunities and exposure to continuity of care for students at all levels of training continuity experiences can provide valuable lessons including observation of the course and treatment of disease and formation of relationships with patients rather than complaints or disease such long term interactions can create powerful bonds between a patient and a student
1741147 wouldnt it be nice if a majority survivors under the age of forty were able to build a database that might begin to uncover the intricacies of the disease the time is now for prevention and cure to stand as equals
1741148 in order to really get at the issue is there life out there we have to know the best place to look
1741149 and in the case of europa the best place to look is where cracks on its icy surface are active today
1741150 this research feeds that need that i have as a geologist and as a person to be the explorer to be the adventurer to see things that no one else has seen before and figure out things that no one else has figured out before
1741151 and out in the solar system is a great place to do that because there are some things like the plumes on enceladus that we really are seeing for the very first time
1741152 europa has the potential for something very similar to hydrothermal systems we have here in our oceans
1741153 very ancient organisms that thrive on oxidized metals could potentially be centered on one of these oases formed by heat and metals seeping from cracks in the ocean floor
1741154 we dont walk around on earth with our eyes closed we want to know whats going on why things happen
1741155 its like galileo looking through his telescope all those centuries ago and going gosh whats out there its that same spirit of exploration and i just get a real kick out of that
1741156 as children begin preparing to return to school its important for parents and children to go over safety tips together

1741158 a blind spot extends about ten feet in front of the bus obstructing the drivers view
1741159 often times children are not aware of this blind spot and might mistakenly believe that if they can see the bus the bus driver can see them
1741160 parents need to consider the many factors when leaving a child home alone
1741161 children mature at different rates so it is crucial to evaluate your childs individual development as well as physical capabilities
1741162 the type of research were performing is very unique and it requires some pretty mind boggling calculations that could have never been done on our older systems
1741163 with the power of our ibm system were gaining new insights into how these complex molecular switches known as receptors function the computer models help guide experimental design in the lab as well as generate new hypotheses
1741164 with its significant price performance advantages and simplified management capabilities the e1350 linux cluster is the ideal high performance computing platform for the ambitious and important work being done by the researchers at umdnj
1741165 teachers salesmen preachers and even telemarketers depend on their voices as much as singers do but are much less likely to realize that they need to care for and protect it
1741166 we see patients who have problems with their voices because of obesity who cant support their words or song because they simply cant take a good breath
1741167 you cant take that personally because we are all on the same team
1741168 we are like a family i look out for them and they look out for me and whoever helps us win the games we have to put out there
1741169 it aint just the speed its the heart you want something thats not afraid to compete half these horses are just show ponies you want something thats not gonna run from a fight

1741172 robot waterboarding became a way of exploring the issue without doing any harm
1741173 should limit prolonged outdoor exertion during the late afternoon or early evening
1741174 taking time to talk with and listen to children about the upcoming school year is one of the best ways parents can help them make the transition to school life
1741175 it sounds like youre kind of worried about this next year
1741176 for preschoolers and kindergartners who are anxious about going to school for the first time parent should try some desensitization
1741177 its called bibliotherapy reading books for the purpose of helping to get into their minds the social story about what can be expected
1741178 there even are some lovely books about kids who goof up
1741179 teachers are pretty skilled at helping children make a good transition
1741180 teachers are the ones who should decide how long the parent remains usually when the parent leaves the crying stops quickly
1741181 if there were some trials from the prior year rather than encouraging negative thinking talk about how it will be a new teacher a new set of things to learn and likely new friends
1741182 if a child has an extreme dread of school have specialists evaluate the child for learning disabilities family issues or other potential causes
1741183 if its more like i hate school because its not as fun as summer talk about some of the positive things about schools
1741184 when theyre active and feel connected to their school they have another reason to do better
1741185 and if theyre on a sports team they have to keep good grades
1741186 young adolescents especially ones entering middle school probably really need to be ready to be organized
1741187 tell the child you know i didnt like school work but i did it because it was a means to an end
1741188 offer to be there for your children if it means going along for the first day at middle school or simply helping them with schoolwork i can see teens feeling a wonderful sense of hope to know that their parent is available
1741189 even though they may find it painful that they only get cs you have to respect them for their integrity and their effort
1741190 children are not only fighting against aids they are fighting against time without treatment half of the children born with hiv will die before they reach their second birthday
1741191 as long as we are still struggling to implement more effective prevention of vertical transmission strategies it is imperative that all children are diagnosed and started on treatment as early as possible after diagnosis or too many children will continue to die
1741192 so few children are born with hiv in developed countries that research into pediatric formulations is not a priority for pharmaceutical companies
1741193 most of the drugs currently available are ill adapted for use in resource limited settings as they are either powders that need to be mixed with water or bitter tasting syrups that also require refrigeration and for the newly approved drugs we have no safety data for use in children
1741194 medicines alone are not enough to keep children living with hiv aids alive
1741195 they and their caregivers need to receive psychosocial support along with their treatment and care especially as they grow older and into adolescence and beyond
1741196 running in place too many patients still in urgent need of hiv aids treatment
1741197 one of the guys pushing the car said without hesitating
1741198 this psychiatry s t apparently what youre feeling is not what youre feeling and what youre not feeling is your real agenda
1741199 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1741200 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1741201 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1741202 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1741203 these people are not like pro fans this is their school its their pride and joy it aint like dolphin stadium i can tell you that
1741204 it takes an endless amount of history to make even a little tradition
1741205 thank you very much and have a nice day ps im sorry there will never be a tommy tuberville wannabe

1741208 i have a lot of arab business partners i do a lot of business in the middle east ive got a lot of friends
1741209 i ask my friends to support candidates that i think are worthy of supporting they usually come through for me
1741210 it is very difficult and is a very logistically intensive business that we have been able to specialize in
1741211 we do difficult logistical things that dont necessarily suit a major oil company its a niche weve been able to occupy
1741212 everything we have done on this contract has been in the best interest of the military and the u s taxpayers
1741213 we strictly follow campaign finance law and where flags are raised well certainly look into it
1741214 a local person but i would like not to talk about it anymore

1741222 our horses give their best every day at these centers and were happy to help facilitate these services
1741223 a save is what it is you save the game its a situation in which the tying run is at the plate or on deck and the game is on the line

1741229 clustered in communities of sameness among people with similar ways of life beliefs and in the end politics
1741230 government should care for those who cant care for themselves
1741231 all right for blacks and whites to date each other
1741232 we didnt set out to make an nc 17 film thats just commercial suicide
1741233 they felt it was rather sexually graphic my point is it was comically graphic all the sex in the movie with the exception of one scene is very cartoonish very campy
1741234 we didnt set out to make an nc 17 film thats just commercial suicide
1741235 they felt it was rather sexually graphic my point is it was comically graphic all the sex in the movie with the exception of one scene is very cartoonish very campy
1741236 as a college student i am naturally in debt and i think filming a homegrown is an inspired way to make some cash as such auditions for my costar will begin tonight dont wear anything complicated all ladies and gentlemen with penises longer than 9
1741237 suddenly we find grace and joy coming in in your tears and anguish and struggle you suddenly discover community you suddenly discover friendship you suddenly discover affection you suddenly discover forgiveness you suddenly discover healing all these things come through vulnerability
1741238 you could always begin to feel pity that was a quality gods image carried with it when you saw the lines at the corners of the eyes the shape of the mouth how the hair grew it was impossible to hate hate was just a failure of imagination
1741239 it would be enough to scare us gods love it set fire to a bush in the desert didnt it and smashed open graves and set the dead walking in the dark oh a man like me would run a mile to get away if he felt that love around
1741240 what even angers me most is the remark made by the npp national chairman peter mac manu that even if a lizard is covered with an npp flag the people will still vote for it

1741245 all of our investments in internal efficiencies have very positive returns with paybacks of less than three years
1741246 slash and burn agricultural pressures are clearing the forest there at an intense rate
1741247 francuski kao ni bilo koji drugi gra ani nisu iznad zakona kad je rije o tako ozbiljnim zlo inima
1741248 we are conscious of what the amazon represents for the world
1741249 its a particularly dense forest thats rich in a food source the gorillas like
1741250 you have to move through on foot its extremely difficult
1741251 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1741252 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1741253 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1741254 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1741255 these incidents occurred after dark so the victims did not get a clear look at what this man was using to threaten them with
1741256 but we are concerned he may have been carrying a knife and we need to find him
1741257 them grabbing a kid this caliber this late in the summer is a unique deal
1741258 you will see him hit a lot of doubles and steal a lot of bags
1741259 the china development bank is willing to share its experience and provide financing to agricultural development in africa
1741260 a big concern is debt lots of debt has just been wiped out and now with china coming are we going to see a new cycle
1741261 the political party that will get my mandate is the one that makes a radical decision to say that all its cabinet ministers having children of schoolgoing age must let them attend public schools
1741262 the results follow these patterns year in year out as a result of which private education has become more expensive
1741263 if the decongestion exercise had not been successful then you the media must be blamed some of you sit on radio and constantly criticize everything you are the cause of everything that has happened
1741264 you would agree with me that there have been several instances where the media have given free publicity to the assemblys programmes which otherwise should have been a paid up advertisement as far i am concerned the media has carried out its duties as is expected of it but talking about the decongestion i believe that it was the kmas own incompetence that accounted for its inability to successfully carry out the exercise
1741265 you know my school days friend would visit me in my home and he would pick from my wardrobe any item of haute culture that he fancied and just fly home with it
1741266 years later i made several attempts to contact him on a visit back home but he refused to see me giving a sea of excuses each time i knew it was all over
1741267 the call to or from a friend in times of support or the need for it may appear like a mirage
1741268 it is important that our customers avoid the risk of buying non genuine spare parts from unauthorised dealers
1741269 in yaw opare krom in the suaman constituency the ndc member of parliament mr s n k ackah got into open confrontation with our party agents when they requested for forms to challenge the citizenship of people who could neither speak any ghanaian language nor had residence in the constituency to merit registration
1741270 including the norwegian management team for the adverse findings of financial improprieties made against them by the companys internal auditors
1741271 who can demonstrate at properly constituted interview panels that they have the experience and competencies to help shape the vision and operations of gt
1741272 this yields a much better picture of the financial health of the company and provides the basis for the government to collect all the inter connectivity arrears and other debts including those owed by government agencies for the effective recapitalisation of gt
1741273 we can do better and were incredibly well placed to drive success in the region weve got to make sure we tailor our resource needs to the games we are making
1741274 were going to invest in more ways than we have before
1741275 often overlooked because everyone does it ive seen it destroy families businesses and churches its everywhere im excited that the campaign is making people more aware we need to make people aware that the tongue can do damage
1741276 over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth
1741277 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1741278 the first candidate to bring up the name of paris hilton was
1741279 here is one time barrack hussein obama brought up paris hilton
1741280 andy warhol said we all get our 15 minutes of fame
1741281 ive already had an hour and a half i mean im so overexposed im making paris hilton look like a recluse
1741282 i figure theres nowhere to go from here but down
1741283 so tonight i announce my retirement from the united states senate
1741284 ive already had an hour and a half i mean im so overexposed im making paris hilton look like a recluse
1741285 when someone like phill kline does something like this just to grandstand the taxpayers have to fund that
1741286 and theyre funding grandstanding on something that was clearly unconstitutional
1741287 it was clear to me that i had the better deal
1741288 it makes a better story to tell you im getting screwed
1741289 but the truth is im not im being treated fairly
1741290 after the initial shock of holy sh i dont have a job anymore its more like okay i have some money they paid me i dont have to go out and go work at
1741291 i dont think i would go back just because my mind is kind of in a different place at this point
1741292 i just feel its an excellent transition tool to reduce the stress of employees
1741293 theres a set of tools called edge that were developed on the naughty dog premises actually by a group of very very senior games programmer some from naughty dog and some from elsewhere
1741294 thats why we think were probably only using 30 or 40 percent of the power of the ps3 right now and theres this great untapped potential
1741295 we used to always think of this industry as the cycle
1741296 i think the reality now is there are several sub cycles
1741297 its hard now to talk about the cycle i think we have to talk about all of the cycles
1741298 the way we think about it at thq is we plan our business around each of those platforms not around the cycle
1741299 nos unit s ont d log les g orgiens de nouli et neutralisent les points de tir des troupes g orgiennes
1741300 le nombre de fonctionnaires ayant une formation politique est insignifiant

1741302 and since im not strong i decided to move out of the queue if it continues this way i dont think i will be able to register
1741303 in its desperate attempts to hang on to power by any means possible in view of the strong clamour for change by the vast majority of ghanaians was abusing the nations democratic process
1741304 we are also aware of bus loads of people who entered elubo from cote d ivoire to be registered but were prevented from doing so by vigilant ndc foot soldiers we are also aware of the way settlers in the atti mokwa constituency and some other constituencies are being harassed and being prevented from registering
1741305 minors and non ghanaians to have their names on the voters register
1741306 people who engage in double registration will have to pay fines before the anomaly is rectified for them
1741307 the registry will recruit more personnel and establish well equipped data processing units to ensure that the computerised system operates effectively
1741308 that is not to say that the concept of free and fair elections is worthless
1741309 they prefer to describe an election as credible or trustworthy or to formulate judgments on the basis of whether conditions existed for the voters to freely express their choices
1741310 ensuring effective election campaigns and credible elections for good governance
1741311 for the emb to be fair it must lay out a transparent general framework for the management and conduct of the election make stakeholders knowledgeable about relevant laws rules and regulations and make adequate preparations for the conduct of the elections
1741312 it must ensure easy and equal access of stakeholders to electoral facilities apply the laws rules and regulations uniformly without favour to party or candidate manage the elections without the control or undue interference from anybody
1741313 since it is impossible to vouch for the integrity of all election officials it must build verifiability into electoral processes such that it is possible to detect a mistake or deliberate wrongdoing
1741314 in spite of the complexity of the concept ultimately being
1741315 the technology involved here is not complex so the question of large illiterate population not understanding such equipment cannot arise
1741316 the greatest challenge to electoral democracy in africa is the mindset of our people towards elections and democracy while election petition tribunals are unique and good the mindset that anyone who loses an election must challenge the result because something must have been done against him is at best unhelpful
1741317 also the mindset that an african big man cannot lose an electoral contest to a small financially less endowed contestant is also a threat to the development of democratic values and processes
1741318 what should be the place of foreign election observers in elections in africa how much power and influence should they be allowed to ascribe unto themselves in determining what is in the best interests of a society that is not theirs
1741319 it will be over ambitious to think that you can form a party and win general elections within the same period
1741320 we are highly limited in terms of finances we dont have the kind of money that the big parties which have been in power have to embark on that kind of campaign
1741321 since we are all stakeholders in this enterprise called ghana which we need to secure for our collective good and prosperity we should all play our role in ensuring that the integrity of the election is without a shadow of doubt
1741322 as we stand at the threshold of a new and better ghana ruled by a better man or the best man we should all be committed to moving forward
1741323 we have confidence in our electoral commission whose independence efficiency and integrity is recognised throughout africa we have confidence in our political process we have confidence in our judiciary that had shown it has the capacity to resolve disputes including election disputes fairly and impartially
1741324 we are all committed to free and fair elections devoid of violence bitterness acrimony
1741325 whilst we applaud ourselves for the significant gains we have made in resisting rule by oppressors both internal and external by creating laws mechanisms and institutional good corporate governance in furtherance of our natural and inalienable right to establish a framework of government which shall secure for ourselves and posterity the blessings of liberty equality of opportunity and prosperity we have not yet reached utopia
1741326 it is good for the country and it is a testimony to the credit of the graphic group which is no doubt a socially responsible company
1741327 the government should publish and give the statistical data in order for us to understand the logic behind the sale
1741328 we should use this as a populist strategy to save other sectors of the economy from collapse
1741329 we can restructure gt ourselves we can provide the funding by asking ghanaians of working age to provide funds to save gt
1741330 i will campaign in the united states for ghanaian scholars and students working and we can raise whatever money the sale of gt would bring

1741352 the idea is people from this camp will head down to the power station and using various peaceful methods will close it down for the day
1741353 weve been doing our best to go round the villages and talk to people were planning to disrupt the power station not the local people
1741354 its fluctuated but the tide is turning as people are actually realizing that we are here to protest peacefully numbers are going up all the time
1741355 weve got a petition going locally and have about 1 500 signatures
1741356 the fact of the matter is a third of british power stations are going to close in the next 10 years we have to provide that capacity and probably a bit more
1741357 kingsnorth is not the main plank of what we plan to do in the future the majority of the replacement is nuclear

1741361 after all my mother who is 71 and all my four children under the age of 17 will benefit free of charge
1741362 my mother sold tomatoes onions garden eggs and many other items at the market so after school i went there to take over from her while she went home to prepare dinner for the family
1741363 i was smallish very argumentative and eloquent in both english and twi so i used that to defend myself and my colleagues from our seniors who tried to bully us in school
1741364 i was so active and vocal that while acting as the national union of ghana students nugs president in 1965 i was arrested detained and released several times before the 1966 coup
1741365 she always made sure that every evening i together with my brothers dr kwakye maafo dr adjei maafo and my first cousin the late santo spent some time studying
1741366 every morning we went to the kosiko river to fetch water and bathe in it before going to school
1741367 i can pluck cocoa break the pod and weed very well
1741368 we were in the same house and dormitory and were close even up to university while i was the best science student at achimota prof mills was the best arts student in 1963 when i got the best science experimental prize in ghana prof mills was an outstanding student in arts

1741372 in these times of world economic recession one would have expected revenue collections to be worse but the figures show otherwise
1741373 the agencies have become pro active and vigilant in their areas of work
1741374 the spate of smuggling has reduced and car custom documentation is also going up
1741375 it is therefore important that in ghanas efforts to consolidate its democratic gains the electoral process needs to be safeguarded from undue manipulation by incumbents whatever their political affiliation
1741376 by co opting state resources for partisan election campaigns the incumbents deny non incumbent candidates a level playing field it skews the electoral process to the incumbents advantage more importantly the practice provides incumbents with the tools to illegally perpetuate their grip on power and hence depriving citizens of their most basic liberty the right to freely choose their representatives and leaders
1741377 it will also reduce the incidence of election related violence abate corruption in its latent and obvious forms by publicising the findings of monitoring exercises and thereby sensitise the public to the problem and stimulate public interest and prepare the grounds for institutional reforms to redress the problem of abuse of office and corruption

1741426 whether or not a service like creative byline can change the submission process it cant change the balance of power which still resides with editors and editors are not going to be enthusiastic about using a system that compels them to respond to every submission they receive creative byline therefore must leave its participating editors the freedom to respond or not as they choose but the belief that editorial response is guaranteed is what will attract many if not most writers to creative byline so right away we have a gap between expectation and reality
1741427 so basically i put together a query package that included an outline a
1741428 i did notice one very strange thing though the reviewer said that
1741429 i contacted cbs customer service for two things 1 my synopsis and
1741430 well cbs customer service is really good a very responsive and nice
1741431 okay so i redo everything and submit and i get the same reviewer
1741432 then its time to select an editor the only publisher they have a
1741433 well i hit that submit button and i wait the second day i see that
1741434 cb has a timeline of three weeks for submission responses after that
1741435 poof end of that three weeks and i have to resubmit again
1741436 what does this all mean for writers i have no idea the only thing i
1741437 in theory i suppose it does work i mean ultimately you want to get your work in the hands of an editor and this does actually do that provided you jump over enough hurdles whether the editors take it seriously or not i suppose well never know but ill let you know how it all turns out

1741454 to threaten resignation involved computer searches through massive electronic databases
1741455 it is not known precisely why searching the databases or data mining raised such a furious legal debate
1741456 there exists a database of americans who often for the slightest and most trivial reason are considered unfriendly and who in a time of panic might be incarcerated the database can identify and locate perceived enemies of the state almost instantaneously
1741457 riots acts of violence insurrections unlawful obstructions or assemblages and disorder prejudicial to public law and order
1741458 an emergency influx of immigrants or to support the rapid development of new programs
1741459 the more data you have on a particular target the better the software can predict what the target will do where the target will go who it will turn to for help
1741460 main core is the table of contents for all the illegal information that the u s government has compiled on specific targets
1741461 it is less a mega database than a way to search numerous other agency databases at the same time
1741462 huge volumes of records of domestic e mails and internet searches as well as bank transfers credit card transactions travel and telephone records
1741463 the nsa effort also ties into data from an ad hoc collection of so called black programs whose existence is undisclosed
1741464 many of the programs in various agencies began years before the 9 11 attacks but have since been given greater reach
1741465 to a national emergency planner everybody looks like a danger to stability
1741466 to accumulate otherwise private data on non targeted u s citizens for use at a future time
1741467 what was being requested of comey for legal approval was exactly what a main core story would be
1741468 comey had discovered that president bush had authorized nsa to use a highly classified and compartmentalized continuity of government database on americans in computerized searches of its domestic intercepts comey had concluded that the use of that main core database compromised the legality of the overall nsa domestic surveillance project
1741469 if a master list is being compiled it would have to be in a place where there are no legal issues
1741470 its clear that dhs has the mandate for controlling and owning master lists the process is not transparent and the criteria for getting on the list are not clear
1741471 i am certain that the content of such a master list as main core would not be carefully vetted and there would be many names on it for many reasons quite likely including the two of us
1741472 in the event of a national emergency the executive branch simply assumes these powers
1741473 when there are no criminal prosecutions and there is no notice to persons on the presidents enemies list that means if congress remains invertebrate the law will be whatever the president says it is even in secret he will be the judge on his own powers and invariably rule in his own favor
1741474 bush may have gone ahead and signed it as a national intelligence finding anyway
1741475 the capacity for future use of this information against the american people is so great as to be virtually unfathomable
1741476 professors teachers and educators labor union organizers and leaders writers lecturers newsmen and others in the mass media field lawyers doctors and scientists other potentially influential persons on a local or national level and individuals who could potentially furnish financial or material aid
1741477 can obtain millions of pieces of information on the personal lives of american citizens by tapping the data stored at any of the 96 federal relocation centers
1741478 without any set of stated rules or regulations its surveillance program remains secret even from the leaders of the house and the senate
1741479 for suspension of the constitution turning control of the united states over to fema and the appointment of military commanders to run state and local governments
1741480 i read in miami papers and several others that there had been a plan by that same agency fema that would suspend the american constitution
1741481 i was deeply concerned about that and wondered if that was the area in which he north had worked
1741482 that question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area so may i request that you not touch upon that sir
1741483 using the computers in his command center north tracked dissidents and potential troublemakers within the united states compared to promis richard nixons enemies list or senator joe mccarthys blacklist look downright crude
1741484 how extreme were the programs they implemented after 9 11 how egregious was the lawbreaking
1741485 maybe the people who think theres a conspiracy out there are right
1741486 as president will you continue aggressive domestic surveillance programs in the vein of the bush administration
1741487 natural disaster epidemic or other serious public health emergency terrorist attack or incident
1741488 allows for emergency military operations in the united states without civilian supervision or control
1741489 we are at the edge of a cliff and were about to fall off
1741490 to a national emergency planner everybody looks like a danger to stability
1741491 the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny
1741492 and there would be no way to fight back because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government no matter how privately it was done is within the reach of the government to know
1741493 concluded that the fourth amendment had no application to domestic military operations
1741494 authority for use of military force to combat terrorist activities within the united states
1741495 exactly what domestic military action was covered by the october memo is unclear but federal documents indicate that the memo relates to the national security agencys terrorist surveillance program
1741496 we will be sending a letter requesting a classified briefing soon
1741497 we have seen the nigger we have seen the greaseball we have seen the chink the slit eyed jap but we never saw the kike because they knew perfectly well thats where you draw the wagons around
1741498 san benedetto del tronto una recita per bambini trasforma il principe azzurro in un tronista gay
1741499 los angeles countys regional congestion crisis requires a regional solution not a political pork barrel rip off
1741500 forcing county taxpayers to fund the subway to the sea extravagance instead of their own regional needs is wrong the sales tax measure was an ill conceived rush job that was forced through the mta by the city of los angeles to avoid obtaining regional collaboration for the other 87 cities and unincorporated communities
1741501 its super exciting just walking around the village and seeing the rainbow of nations with every countrys colours and the different shapes and sizes of the athletes
1741502 its just really really cool it just kind of brings that olympic spirit to a head
1741503 its the first time where we actually meet all of us most of us have been here for two three four five days but its the first time that we gathered were here for the flag raising so it was very special and you could feel that the whole team is happy to be here the village is incredible so were ready to compete now
1741504 i won exactly on the sixth of august 1984 so to see the canadian flag go up like this and now in the position of chef de mission it was very special for me
1741505 for us it is pretty much the last thing we will do as the olympic team until august 17th so it was important for us to be here
1741506 we had to rush through the workout but it was important for us to be here and the kids really wanted to be here good mood great village we had a great camp so people are excited
1741507 one coach had a good analogy he said you know what
1741508 we belong here we belong in the playoffs we might not be the red wings yet but were going to be right in there anything can happen and thats the fun thing
1741509 i was thinking that today i was out on the line and thinking this is just gorgeous it never does get old
1741510 we are pleased that cas has confirmed our legal interpretation
1741511 it is laid down quite clearly in the fifa statutes
1741512 which because of the legal dispute largely had to be conducted without diego is so far advanced that a recall at this point in time would no longer make any sense in sporting terms
1741513 hes relaxed and asks the people at barcelona to understand his situation the club is relaxed and i was figuring to put messi in the starting 11
1741514 theoretically the clubs could ask their players to go back to europe because they would be entitled to do so
1741515 and if the players do not come back there could be a case of a breach of contract
1741516 this decision does not affect the eligibility status of the players who have been validly entered by their national olympic committee and who remain fully eligible to compete in olympic games of beijing 2008
1741517 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
1741518 le statistiche sulle morti sul lavoro che periodicamente ci vengono trasmesse sono fasulle
1741519 soltanto in italia esiste il paradosso per il quale si contano come morti sul lavoro al fine di poter dare benefici assicurativi da parte dellinail anche le morti che avvengono per incidenti stradali capitati mentre si va al lavoro o mentre si torna a casa dopo il lavoro
1741520 for the third olympics in a row ill be watching the ceremony
1741521 weve organized at the bike shop to order some chinese food and watch the opening ceremonies
1741522 every games there are teams and athletes who decide not to walk for many reasons that we respect
1741523 its a long day its tiring its going to be hot and humid of course were here to perform thats our main goal to make sure athletes compete
1741524 you cant expect people to go for a two hour walk and stand up for hours after that the day before or even three days before their competition
1741525 these athletes are competing all the time not just every four years and its a really big stretch on their routines to do something like that
1741526 for people that have races the next day its a no brainer
1741527 there is no way we want to do that the buzz we want to create is on the podium whatever it takes to do that we want to do i dont begrudge anyone who decides not to go to the opening ceremony its way close and way to late its not worth it for us
1741528 i love opening ceremonies so i would go now if i was competing the next day i would do the march in but maybe not stay for the whole thing its a hard decision i think for some people its not good for them for me i love it
1741529 we knew it a long time ago so we could sort of deal with it then we get to go to the closing ceremonies instead
1741530 we are quite optimistic about the weather on that day we have help from god
1741531 the athletes village in beijing is nice but its like living in a shopping mall there are thousands of people there
1741532 here in singapore we have exclusive rights to the track were in a very nice hotel its a nice clean environment
1741533 yes if its someones first olympics and they want to march in the opening ceremonies i feel bad for them
1741534 but all our athletes know theyre here to compete and compete well the opening ceremonies have no significance in an athletes life except a personal one
1741535 i didnt go to the opening ceremonies in athens either
1741536 but thats just the way its always been you cant complain about it too much im at the olympic games im experiencing everything else ive got to be in bed early friday night

1741539 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1741540 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1741541 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1741542 todays indictments are a reminder of a growing threat that every american faces in the 21st century the fact that each individuals greatest asset is their names their identity
1741543 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1741544 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
1741545 we crossed a number of scientific barriers in this case
1741546 theres an irony in that we tend to think that sport should somehow transcend politics but it rarely does
1741547 there were alternative olympics set up in barcelona and they had gotten as far as printing the programs but then the spanish civil war broke out
1741548 the nazis they used those games in order to prove to their own people their international legitimacy
1741549 you may be seeing some parallels with the current games
1741550 there was a nonviolent protest and the government opened fire and killed about 250 people and the international olympic committee said this was a domestic issue and should not be addressed by the olympic movement
1741551 you can shoot down 250 people on the street but dont ruin our medal ceremony
1741552 people are completely oblivious to the fact that people were massacred in the streets of mexico city it shows how images and media can create our perception of a historical event
1741553 however that was an event that created its own history
1741554 if that hadnt happened you wouldnt associate the 1972 games with terrorism
1741555 the beijing olympics mark the moment in human history when china which is farthest from the political centers of the west both culturally and geographically is incorporated into the world system to a degree never seen before
1741556 because of the intense interaction and high level of collaboration with the outside world required to organize the olympic games many chinese people are just now realizing that their old way of doing things did not reach international standards and that they did not understand the west as well as they thought they did
1741557 the impression they make on the rest of the world is secondary
1741558 whats important is to show their own people the 95 percent who arent communists that the rest of the world acknowledges the communist party as the legitimate leader of china
1741559 if the u s president will stand next to their leader thats fine

1741569 no specific decision of the fifa executive committee establishing the obligation for the clubs to release players under 23 for this tournament
1741570 cas calls upon the goodwill and the good sense of fifa and the clubs to find a reasonable solution with regard to players who wish to represent their country in the olympic games
1741571 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
1741572 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit
1741573 it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration

1741587 on wednesday morning when she was at the station she was walking past the same men when one of them pushed her and she fell onto the track she suffered a fractured wrist and bruising to her legs she was taken to hospital for treatment but has since been released

1741589 we are appalled by this incident and hope the perpetrators are quickly identified
1741590 i had some luck with me as i didnt hit it too well but made putts from everywhere i was holing out 10 footers for birdies
1741591 my putting hasnt been great this year and i changed to a new putter this week after getting it fitted at the scotty cameron studio in california last month
1741592 when i first saw the course i thought that one under would be a good round if you miss it left or right you can easily run up a big number if i shoot one or two under tomorrow ill take it
1741593 it was a good start i felt pretty average after just flying in only yesterday but i guess from playing well last week it just kept flowing
1741594 there are opportunities out there as long as you hit it straight my confidence is at a different level im just staying with the process and hitting every shot the best that i can
1741595 i putted nicely but its such a difficult golf course
1741596 the fairway on 10th is the narrowest ive seen and you just have to concentrate really well and take it one shot at a time
1741597 lucy is fighting for the freedom and democracy of tibet and is doing what she feels is right and what i feel is right obviously im worried any parent would be but i am certain that china would not resort to torture or abuse when the eyes of the world are upon them
1741598 i felt he was so passionate about it i couldnt say dont do it in fact i wholeheartedly backed him to do it he set out to achieve something and he has done that
1741599 we did this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool they are whitewashing their human rights record on tibet so our action today shines a spotlight on those atrocities in march tibetans took to the streets risking everything in their calls for justice and human rights and we stand today with this action in solidarity with those calls

1741713 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets

1741743 despite the lack of any evidence that knife crime is a serious problem we assert that it is a serious problem you should all be afraid

1741771 sa di essere al centro degli interessi di mercato di molte societ sportive vi confermo che la roma ha contattato il real per lacquisto del calciatore ma alla dirigenza blanca lofferta della roma apparsa inadeguata
1741772 le cifre sono quelle apparse sulla stampa italiana posso dirle che la cifra offerta dalla roma si aggira intorno ai 12 milioni di euro non posso dirle la cifra offerta al giocatore perch non siamo stati contattati n direttamente n ufficialmente

1742014 perception of social responsibility remains critical to garnering college students brand loyalty in current collegiate environment it is very cool to be good brands who sic enable college students to reflect their own social responsibility by association have an advantage
1742015 the digital revolution on campus shows no signs of slowing students have come to expect 24 7 connectedness and mobility now flexibility and ease of function to socialize communicate and be entertained is what theyre demanding
1742016 with college students quickly and easily adopting new technologies enabling a constant desire to engage and connect the study gives marketers more than just a glimpse into students media behaviors but also an essential view into finding their way in
1742017 all planets and stars for example are in the charge of divine astral beings the influence of man from the heavenly bodies is the result of a universal symbiosis governed by laws upheld by these higher beings planets and stars of themselves have no conscious power to guide or determine the destiny of man but as the whole universe consists of and is held in existence by natures creative vibratory power each individual unit radiates a characteristic electromagnetic vibration that links it with other units in the cosmos depending on the interaction these vibrations are productive of good or ill man is a miniature of the universe in which he lives his basic composition of which his physical body is merely a gross manifestation is his astral body formed from the thoughts of god and structured around and from the creative forces and consciousness in the spiritual eye and the subtle cerebrospinal centers the spiritual eye has a correspondence with the cosmic sun and the six twelve by polarity spinal centers medullary cervical dorsal lumbar sacral and coccygeal plexuses correspond to planetary influences representing by the twelve zodiacal signs of astrology the astrological stars of a person are nothing but an environment he himself has chosen by the karmic pattern he has fashioned by his past life actions according to his karmic pattern he is attracted to be reborn on earth at a given time that is favorable to the fulfillment of that pattern in that sense astrology is only a very poor way of finding out what ones past karma is it is at best an unsure art when practiced by those who lack divine intuitive perception i wrote at length about this in autobiography of a yogi outwitting the stars
1742018 conformally wrapping surfaces with stretchable sheets of optoelectronics provides a practical route for integrating well developed planar device technologies onto complex curvilinear objects
1742019 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
1742020 we can now for the first time move device design beyond the flatland constraints of conventional wafer based systems
1742021 optics simulations and imaging studies show that these systems provide a much broader field of view improved illumination uniformity and fewer aberrations than flat cameras with similar imaging lenses
1742022 african american adolescent females seeking treatment for stds are at high risk for hiv however no interventions have demonstrated efficacy in reducing hiv associated sexual behaviors among this vulnerable subgroup
1742023 this technique is a clean probe of the microscopics in this system and it allows us to see interesting things like a very large energy gap that seems to appear before the superfluid state
1742024 the advantages of curved detector surface imaging have been understood by optics designers for a long time and by biologists for an even longer time
1742025 thats how the human eye works using the curved surface at the back of the eye to capture an image
1742026 in a conventional planar camera parts of the images that fall at the edges of the fields of view are typically not imaged well using simple optics
1742027 the hemisphere layout of the electronic eye eliminates this and other limitations thereby providing improved imaging characteristics
1742028 in previous simulations this region came out smooth but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter
1742029 some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation and it might easily be detected by glast
1742030 there are several candidate particles for cold dark matter and our predictions for glast depend on the assumed particle type and its properties
1742031 for typical wimps anywhere from a handful to a few dozen clear signals should stand out from the gamma ray background after two years of observations that would be a big discovery for glast
1742032 it simulates the dark matter distribution from near the time of the big bang until the present epoch so practically the entire age of the universe and focuses on resolving the halo around a galaxy like the milky way
1742033 we see a lot of substructure even in the inner part of the halo where the solar system is
1742034 every substructure has its own sub substructure and so on there are lumps on all scales
1742035 we can make comparisons with the dwarf galaxies and stellar streams associated with the milky way the appearance of these stellar systems is closely linked to the substructure of the dark matter halo
1742036 we have found a dictionary of genes critical to a viral infection using these techniques this can be done with any virus
1742037 while i was running an experiment at the caltech brain imaging center a group of students happened to pass by on a tour and i volunteered to explain what i was doing
1742038 as part of the experiment a moving display was running on my computer screen with dots rapidly expanding out somewhat like the opening scene of star wars
1742039 does anyone else hear something when you look at that
1742040 i queried a few hundred people and three more individuals turned up
1742041 do you hear sounds when you see things move or flash
1742042 people with auditory synesthesia may be even less likely than people with other synesthetic associations to fully realize that their experience is unusual these individuals have an enhanced soundtrack in life rather than a dramatically different experience compared to others
1742043 synesthetes had an advantage because they not only saw but also heard the visual patterns
1742044 this translation might result in actual sound perception in synesthetes perhaps due to stronger than normal connections says saenz who has begun brain imaging experiments to study this connectivity in synesthetes and nonsynesthetes
1742045 we might find that motion processing centers of the visual cortex are more interconnected with auditory brain regions than previously thought even in the normal brain
1742046 at this point very little is known about how the auditory and visual processing systems of the brain work together understanding this interaction is important because in normal experience our senses work together all the time
1742047 we have seen first hand what the lack of tummy time can mean for a baby developmental cognitive and organizational skills delays eye tracking problems and behavioral issues to name just some complications
1742048 new parents are told of the importance of babies sleeping on their backs to avoid sids but they are not always informed about the importance of tummy time
1742049 ideally babies should be placed on their tummies after every nap diaper change and feeding starting with 1 2 minutes
1742050 since the early 1990s we have seen a significant decrease in sids cases while simultaneously witnessing an alarming increase in skull deformation
1742051 increasing the amount of time your baby lies on his or her tummy promotes muscle development in the neck and shoulders helps prevent tight neck muscles and the development of flat areas on the back of the babys head and helps build the muscles baby needs to roll sit and crawl
1742052 its important to get our infants out of devices that constrain mobility and onto their tummies so they can focus on neck muscle balance as they interact with their caregivers
1742053 people want to know how people make decisions whether its how you drive your car or whether to invest in a mortgage its important to understand when and how we make those decisions to understand the type of errors people are prone to make
1742054 what we have found is that people make decisions based on what option appears to be better most of the time under conditions in the natural world this would be the best strategy but in modern life it has nothing do with the real inherent risks
1742055 you save one minute but you can lose everything people dont do the math

1742077 it has been more than a year since the housing market went on a tumultuous skid yet the hangover from bad lending practices and tighter credit has housings two primary sponsors fannie mae and freddie mac still unable to step in and fully provide support
1742078 given the likelihood of a prolonged housing slump and the uncertainty of government support investors should remain extremely cautious of lenders like freddie mac or fannie mae
1742079 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1742080 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion dollars of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1742081 barack obama believes offshore drilling is not really the short term or long term answer to the problem
1742082 let me bring in evan bayh and give him a chance to talk about this also offshore oil drilling the obama campaign criticized john mccain for flip flopping on oil drilling and then a week later the obama campaign flip flopped on oil drilling why
1742083 well i dont think he has flip flopped at all joe you dont have to listen to the politicians about this you can listen to people like boone pickens who has made billions of dollars in the oil industry he has said very clearly we cant drill our way out of this problem you can listen to charlies fellow governor arnold schwarzenegger a pretty straight shooting guy who says that anybody who says we can drill our way out of this problem is not being straight with the american people
1742084 what is barack obamas position on offshore oil drilling because a lot of people are confused
1742085 he believes it is not really the short term or long term answer to the problem

1742088 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
1742089 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
1742090 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
1742091 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
1742092 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
1742093 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
1742094 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
1742095 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
1742096 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
1742097 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
1742098 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
1742099 most of the things we depend upon would be gone and we would literally be depending on our own assets and those we could reach by walking to them
1742100 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
1742101 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
1742102 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
1742103 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
1742104 one of the nations in the middle east had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel they had taken a short range probably scud missile put it on a transporter erector launcher lowered it in taken the vessel out into the water peeled back the top erected it fired it lowered it and covered it up and the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50 60 100 other ships operating in the immediate area
1742105 well known to the white house but have not been disseminated to the appropriate congressional committees
1742106 could be used in a devastating stealth attack against the united states or israel for which the united states has no known or planned defense
1742107 the use of an atomic bomb against israel would destroy israel completely while the same against the islamic only would cause damages such a scenario is not inconceivable
1742108 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
1742109 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
1742110 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
1742111 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
1742112 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
1742113 as of today we have no defense against such an attack we need space based missile defenses to protect against an emp attack
1742114 nuclear missiles dont discriminate on party lines when they land
1742115 senator obama has been quoted as saying i dont agree with a missile defense system and that we can cut 10 billion of the research out never mind as i say that the entire budget is 9 6 billion or 9 3 billion
1742116 needs a missile defense that is so strong in all the different phases we need to defend against that countries will decide its not worth coming up against us

1742121 the prophets endure and can only be ignored at the risk of our own despair
1742122 at a minimum cruel and unusual treatment and at worst torture
1742123 it is astonishing to me still that i should be here today addressing the issue of american cruelty or that anyone would ever have to our forefathers who permanently defined our civic values drafted our constitution inspired by the belief that law could not create but only recognize certain inalienable rights granted by god to every person not just citizens and not just here but everywhere those rights form a shield that protects core human dignity because this is so the eighth amendment prohibits cruel punishment the constitutional jurisprudence of the fifth and fourteenth amendments outlaws cruel treatment that shocks the conscience the nuremberg trials that triumph of american justice and statesmanship that launched the modern era of human rights and international criminal law treated prisoner abuse as an indictable crime the geneva conventions forbid the application of cruel inhuman and degrading treatment to all captives as do all of the major human rights treaties adopted and ratified by our country during the last century there should have been no doubt or ambiguity about the standard of conduct that our laws require of us and even if laws have jurisdictional limits there could have been no doubt about what our values forbade
1742124 dang you know what i need right now nothing sounds better then blowing my nose a dozen times and getting all blotchy
1742125 is a monster i can think of him as nothing else but the butcher of asia of his grin of triumph on giving the order to drop the atom bombs on japan of his maintaining troops in china who are shooting the starving chinese for stealing a handful of food is it that we are so devoted to a good massa that we feel that we ought not to even protest such crimes have we no men among us if we cannot stop it we can at least let it be known that we are not deceived we can make any party who condones it let alone orders it tremble for election time

1742146 water use in california consumes significant amounts of electrical energy preliminary estimates indicate that total energy used to pump and treat this water exceeds 15 000 gwh per year or at least 6 5 percent of the total electricity used in the state per year this energy use is expected to increase due to a growing population increasing reuse of wastewater the remoteness or lower quality of alternative water sources and increasingly stringent treatment requirements due to a variety of water quality and environmental protection concerns
1742147 3 of national energy consumption equivalent to approximately 56 billion kilowatt hours kwh for drinking water and wastewater services
1742148 if one out of every 100 american homes retrofitted with water efficient fixtures we could save about 100 million kwh of electricity per year and avoid adding 80 000 tons of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere epas

1742153 bottling water produced more than 2 5 million tons of carbon dioxide
1742154 in fact 80 boston restaurants are participating in a unicef initiative in which restaurants ask their guests to contribute 1 or more for their glasses of tap water funds for the program go to providing children with safe drinking water

1742156 only one in five uk organisations have a green it policy and just one in eight can show any quantifiable energy savings resulting from green it

1742172 this was a frivolous lawsuit it was a desperate attempt to try to keep the voter initiative off the ballot in november
1742173 were disappointed but this ruling does not affect the campaign against prop 8 in any way
1742174 we have been focused on continuing the election and moving forward
1742175 it really penalizes voters through no fault of their own
1742176 this ruling puts thousands of real florida citizens at risk this november based on bureaucratic typos
1742177 voters who do everything right who submit forms that are complete timely and accurate will suddenly find themselves unregistered when they go to vote because someone somewhere slipped on a keyboard
1742178 the most senseless part is that the state creates these errors and then makes it unnecessarily hard to fix the problem
1742179 you cant show a passport you cant show a military id and though you can show your drivers license itself it doesnt count if you show it at the polls the very place where voters have to show a photo id anyway
1742180 it is critical that florida have accurate voter rolls not only to prevent fraud and errors in the system but to ensure that floridians have confidence in our voter registration process
1742181 supervisors are working diligently to provide easy and convenient ways to register and we all want to protect the integrity of the voter registration process
1742182 this includes notifying the voter of any discrepancy and giving them the opportunity to correct errors on their application
1742183 that is what they did in 2000 with the flawed felon list
1742184 at the very least the counties can and should help avoid the chaos that this law creates by making it possible to fix the problem at the polls
1742185 we hope that the county supervisors of elections use the discretionary power they have to allow corrections at the polls so that voters are inconvenienced as little as possible
1742186 resolution to accept the invitation to establish a sister relationship with the people of andres eloy blanco municipality venezuela

1742413 you tell your mother anything about tonight and trust me there aint gonna be no one worse than me
1742414 i wont allow a whore to work here youre fired
1742415 yet she had no control over such a persistent heart

1742421 he may not be quite as athletic but he moves ok and his hand eye coordination is terrific im anxious to see what he can do in pads
1742422 hes still making plays its a long way from now until september but this kid definitely has a chance
1742423 humphrey hasnt played much football in the past three years due to injuries and finley is extremely raw it may take them a few weeks to get comfortable things could look completely different by the middle of august but right now moore is far and away the second best tight end on the team
1742424 first of all its a really strong female character and i think that despite the fact that there have been some really good ones theres a dearth of that
1742425 i think the time is ripe to sort of see someone whos really really strong also the dynamite comic book series has been doing very very well so clearly the popularity of red sonja which has sort of waxed and waned over the years is really on the rise again
1742426 were going to draw from various influences not from the 1985 film whatsoever
1742427 but i think there are aspects from the comic book both from the 70s and 80s marvel series as well as the dynamite series theyre aspects people will recognize but the reality is we wanted to kind of reinvent sonja we wanted to create a red sonja 2009 something that comic book devotees can recognize and fall in love with but something that people who know nothing about her will immediately like as well
1742428 at the end of the day youre not going to please everyone but i do believe that the hardcore redheads as they are called are going to be pleasantly surprised theyre going to be much more pleased then perhaps then they even think they are going to be at this point
1742429 i came in when robert rodriguez was brought in to produce
1742430 ive worked with robert for many years and then he brought the script to me and said look i am going to produce this what do you think
1742431 its the kind of world you cant do justice by just throwing a green screen up and shoot the actors in front of it
1742432 you really need to have the grittiness you got to have the rawness of blade hitting skin hoofs hitting dirt so we are going to have a sort of combination of the two we are going meld the cg world with the practical world
1742433 we just finished scouting locations all around the u s
1742434 right after this were literally are flying out and going into pre production
1742435 i just think fans of the comic book are really going to be into it
1742436 i think they are going to be really surprised its really kick ass its really true to the sonja spirit and at the same time its going to be something new just wait for the movie
1742437 hes extremely athletic and he can make all of the throws he just needs more experience right now hes a little too quick to leave the pocket and hes not going through his progressions on a consistent basis its going to take some time but if everyone stays patient he should be just fine
1742438 the fourth and fifth best linebackers in camp have been its not out of the question that both middle linebackers could make the final 53 brandon chillar has looked ok interestingly hes been more effective against the run than the pass so far that wasnt his reputation in st louis

1742442 we have talked a lot and you will hear all of us talk about the process of grieving with hope

1742509 we the city council pass a resolution against the publics freedom of speech on blogs
1742510 no one is more despised by career politicians than someone who insists on telling the truth and can back it up with good files
1742511 apparently mr durkin approves of free speech for everyone except blogs
1742512 at the car show the candidates have all had an opportunity to get out and meet folks
1742513 pay attention to how council members are acting and progressing at meetings use your vote to eliminate dysfunction and get involved in citizen groups to keep tabs on your council
1742514 there has got to be a group of citizens that are able to identify when things are starting to go to pot in their government and somehow put the focus on that
1742515 thank you in advance for any assistance you may be able to provide
1742516 i keep running into highly capable potential leaders all over the country who literally never give a thought to the well being of their community and i keep wondering who gave them permission to stand aside
1742517 most americans welcome the voice that lifts them out of themselves they want to be better people they want to help make this a better country when the american spirit awakens it transforms worlds but it does not awaken without a challenge
1742518 as citizens we have every right to raise hell when we see injustice done or the public interest betrayed or the public process corrupted
1742519 winfreys ability to influence the actions of her supporters is impressive polling evidence suggests that this effect on consumers decisions may translate to politics
1742520 furthermore oprah is regarded as one of the most prominent and influential public figures in the united states if a celebrity endorsement is ever going to have an empirically identifiable influence then it is likely to be hers
1742521 if there is one conclusion to which human experience unmistakably points it is that democratic ends demand democratic methods for their realization
1742522 the viability of our democratic institutions is founded upon the principle of free speech unfettered debate and the free exchange of ideas to gag and stifle any is shameful regardless of whos involved a commitment to democratic principles is more important than party personality affiliation
1742523 life can be a curse as well as a blessing
1742524 what is the most basic article of faith this is not all that we are
1742525 life has a melody gaius a rhythm of notes that become your existence once played in harmony with gods plan

1742533 chair tom fitzpatrick stated that council should not direct the planning commission to make a finding before public input has been received
1742534 its not my job to argue with the state legislature
1742535 much of it was either patently false seriously in dispute or counterbalanced by actions that the public was unaware
1742536 bjorn likes to be in the lime light that is what he was best known for being a good actor in high school
1742537 its bad enuf he hurts his own reputation but hes dragging anoka down as well thats my concern
1742538 ive lived in mpls for the past five years or so but i still vote in anoka just so i can keep voting for bjorn
1742539 the old mayor who used his power to make money off land deals
1742540 its like going back to middle school except with a lot more beer
1742541 my biggest concern is that the tip of anoka was just designated a park so quick how does that benefit anoka and why this land south of high school aka tract b wouldnt be better as a park for the city
1742542 so its fair to say your biggest concern is that this development is too close to the river
1742543 the council has met and discussed tract b land south of high school no less than two dozen times they discussed what this parcel should be
1742544 it isnt that bad past the first 3 inches its all brand new
1742545 whos there show yourself you coward face me and fight
1742546 who are you why do you show me these monstrous visions show yourself damn you
1742547 the only time i would bend my knee before you is when i kneel to aim an arrow at your cursed brain show yourself and face me like the man you claim you are coward
1742548 did you see the size of that thing it must have a wingspan of at least twenty yards
1742549 trick of the light like i told you before this is the time of day you see the strangest things
1742550 a man a giant man vulture is that what it looked like young novice
1742551 there are no giant man vultures boy not anymore a trick of the light is all it was we saw one sees strange things on an awamas ki raat the lack of a moon confuses the human mind such nights now get your thoughts back on your work its almost time to open the gates
1742552 but somasra you saw it too it was a garuda just like the ones in the frescoes at the war museum from the asura wars
1742553 you were there somasra you fought in the last war with my father youve seen creatures like that before havent you how can you say they dont exist
1742554 because they dont is why you talk about the last war what do you know of it you were not even a seed in your fathers gonads when the last asura war ended that was twenty two years ago this past shravan who are you to speak of such things
1742555 what do you greenhorns know of asuras and suchlike giant man vultures jatayus jatayus not garudas mind you
1742556 aye i fought with your father shoulder to shoulder if not for him i would not be standing here manning this wall today your father was a good man vishnu take his aatma he and i saw enough beasts out of hell to last a hundred lifetimes thats why maharaja dasaratha formed the pfs to give us veterans a regiment of our own he almost disbanded the entire army thats how much he wanted to put the war behind him we all did because some things are best forgotten
1742557 i didnt mean to be disrespectful somasra its thanks to you all that we live in times of peace today i know that every arya in the seven nations knows it
1742558 youre lucky is what you are to be born in the first time of peace since the rise of the arya nations but dont just thank us pfs thank the good maharaja dasaratha he was always at the forefront of the arya armies fighting right beside us and its thanks to him and maharaja janak and the other clan chiefs that we were able to rid the land of the last asuras why dasaratha was away fighting so long he was in his thirty fifth year by the time the wars ended and he and rani kausalya hadnt even begun a family yet imagine that if you will most of us are grandparents by that age truly he gave his best years and best men to the cause he planted the banyan tree of peace and prosperity beneath which we all shelter today
1742559 i must have seen a vulture thats all and my imagination ran away with me ive been listening to too many stories in the veterans inn i guess
1742560 stories are necessary young un but thats all the tales of the asura wars are now stories and may they always stay just that vishnu be praised
1742561 past gate opening time move to it time enough for stories and wine when the shifts ended
1742562 you want jatayus ill tell you a story about jatayus thatll turn your blood to icemelt over a matka of the maharajas bhaang at the holi feast today now get back to work
1742563 and yet you made sure he was a born brahmin with his naming ceremony and thread ceremony performed correctly as well as his coming of age ceremony performed in the past week just like the other boys before him

1742569 you have great vidya great kala this knowledge and art would be an immense aid to me in my rituals the dark lord desires acolytes such as yourself to join his cause we are islanded here in the midst of these deva worshiping hordes tiny isolated islets in an ocean of wretched brahman we must join together and ensure our lords victory
1742570 as recognition of our new alliance i offer you in our lords name this special dispensation use it as you see fit to recruit new acolytes to his cause there is much much more where this came from the dark lord knows how easily these mortals are seduced by the lure of gold keep as much as you think fit as your own reward you have served him well and he is greatly pleased
1742571 make sure the footmen dont know what it contains place it in the usual khazana box inside carefully you almost killed the last one when you dropped him
1742572 what brings you to this forlorn part of the city
1742573 its good to see you havent lost your wit kausalya
1742574 dharma my lord a big word to use for a small act of daily habit surely all your queens begin their day by offering a few basic prayers to the ancestors the gods and to their lord and master no decent married woman in kosala would do any less
1742575 how have you been my queen i trust all is well with you you do not want for anything
1742576 what is there about me that could possibly interest you any longer
1742577 come come now you know that you are my first queen my first bride
1742578 we have shared so many happy nights here on this playground of pleasure
1742579 not yet my king not all your wives may be as diligent in their duties but i was brought up better than that there are traditions to be followed
1742580 my queen this is ridiculous arghya is done to greet a guest honoring your house with a rare visit not your own husband
1742581 i could name guests who have visited our house more often raje
1742582 i have to speak to you on a matter of great importance dispense with these foolish games
1742583 you are truly a great king ayodhya naresh you visit your first wifes chambers after such a long absence and this is how you show your affection toward her
1742584 i apologize if i spoke harshly it has been a long time since you graced me with your presence i have been so long in my own company i seem to have forgotten how to behave in the presence of my king
1742585 please do me the honor of sitting with me in my akasa chamber together we shall watch the new day dawn and you may speak your mind freely i shall not forget the rules of royal hospitality again
1742586 say no more not another word i am ashamed enough as it is
1742587 please believe me i have never stopped loving you not a day not an hour not a moment has passed when i did not think of you
1742588 that i acted foolishly even cruelly i neglected you without cause or reason explanation or excuse it is shameful in a kshatriya unforgivable in a king but even after i realized it i did not know how to express my regret to you how to make amends even the gurus are not so wise in matters of men and women kausalya
1742589 you do not know how many times i desired to come to you to beseech you to forgive me to let me start afresh
1742590 you should have come i would have forgiven you in a trice if only you had come
1742591 i should have come but i had not the heart you know you alone know how much i fear rejection i hesitate to venture where i might not find certain victory for grieving as i was yes that is the word grieving for our lost love i could not bear the thought of you turning me away pushing me out then i should have been lost utterly
1742592 turn you away push you out you fool you royal fool i would have taken you in with open arms i could never turn you away
1742593 is it true then would you have forgiven me so easily
1742594 perhaps forgiveness would have taken a while i am no devi just a woman a woman still trying to be a queen but i would have let you stay of that much you can be certain
1742595 the royal vaids find my ailment fascinating to study and impossible to cure
1742596 i am being uncharitable they do their best it is true yet even the great medical science of ayurveda doesnt have all the answers
1742597 we will speak of that later i promise but right now i am better than i have been in years
1742598 but i feel good better than i have felt in a long time perhaps that is why i was able to find the strength to come to you at last
1742599 kaikeyi if you dont wake up this instant i will pour this ice cold water on your head
1742600 kaikeyi this is your last warning girl next comes the water brace yourself
1742601 and you whore maharajas whore now wake up whore and see where your master has gone while you slept the dawn away
1742602 who foolish woman your husband the king of kosala master of ayodhya maharaja dasaratha who else how many other men do you share your bed with
1742603 that was what i thought naturally i assumed it was because of his health an ailing septuagenarian does not desire physical intimacy as frequently as a robust young man
1742604 you can never tell with men they often feign weakness only to conserve their lustful energies for other newer conquests
1742605 i was fooled just as you were believing his health kept him from your bed now i see hes had his own agenda the shrewd bastard
1742606 what are you gaping at girl standing around here wont do us any good we have to find out what the old jackass is up to and quickly get dressed kaikeyi
1742607 why are you asking about dasaratha what did he do
1742608 thats what we have to find out you stupid slut
1742609 shama mahadev forgive me for interrupting your sacred meditation there is a visitor who wishes to have your audience at once normally i would have told any visitor to come back at a more suitable time but this is no ordinary lord or lady seeking your ashirwaad
1742610 mahadev it is none other than the great sage vishwamitra himself the famed seer mage in person he is standing at the gate of the royal palace refusing to take a step inside he says he cannot enter until invited by the lord of the abode i pray i did nothing to offend him i rushed directly here to inform you
1742611 now you must go and inform the maharaja protocol demands that he and i must both go to the gate and welcome this illustrious visitor with all due formality you understand what a great honor this is vishwamitra has been in the deep forest meditating for a great length of time if he has interrupted his meditation there must be a very good reason it is imperative that all the necessary traditions and rituals be followed to the last detail go quickly and fetch maharaja dasaratha i will make the other arrangements and meet you both in the foyer in a few minutes
1742612 so you must know where he is then you always know sumantra you are the eyes ears and conscience of the throne
1742613 guruji the maharaja is with first queen kausalya in her private sleeping chambers
1742614 much as i would love you to come to me every day like this
1742615 you did mention something you wished to discuss with me what was it
1742616 yes my rani i do indeed have something of great importance to tell you but any discussion about it will have to wait for later already i have spent almost an hour in your beguiling embrace much as i hate to leave your company our good sumantra and mahaguru vashishta will already be seeking me out and in another hour or two the festival celebrations will begin in earnest and then the usual endless queue of court nobility and well wishers will start arriving with their rang thalis
1742617 today after the holi parade i will announce the coronation of my successor i will name our son rama crown prince of ayodhya
1742618 but youre still young dasa you still have many years of life and vigor in you your father aja his father raghu your ancestors almost all the suryavansha kings reigned well into their gray years why raghu was almost thirty years older than you when he crowned aja prince of ayodhya its too soon to step down from the throne its much too soon dasa
1742619 my queen what breed of woman are you i tell you i am going to crown your birth son rama prince of ayodhya and you try to dissuade me is this the way a mother speaks
1742620 this is the way a queen speaks out of love and concern for her husband and king
1742621 you are like no other woman i have ever known kausalya
1742622 it is already marked on the royal calendar my queen guru vashishta has even picked an auspicious date for the coronation the tenth day of the first half of the month of chaitra
1742623 not just his the most auspicious day of the year apart from the usual feast days
1742624 almost as auspicious as the day he was born to you my queen that night was truly a great tryst of the stars and planets it was as if the devas themselves graced his birth with good omens
1742625 miracle is the right word he came to us when we had lost all hope of progeny after all the yagnas and pooja rituals had failed to produce results all of kosala celebrated for a week
1742626 what better muhurat to announce ramas coronation than the sixteenth anniversary of that miraculous day
1742627 but thats this month less than half a moon from today dasa all im asking is why so soon its barely been a year since hes been home from the gurukul give him a little time to grow to learn to marry even once the cares and weight of statehood fall upon his shoulders he will no longer be a boy give him a little more time dasa
1742628 there is no more time kausalya i am dying the vaids and guru vashishta agree that my remission is a temporary reprieve before the end the illness that plagues me has run its course as i have run mine before i die i will see rama crowned prince
1742629 you are needed guru vashishta has sent for you urgently he waits in your palace
1742630 something to do with the coronation announcement this morning no doubt probably he wishes to add yet another ceremony to the list you know how pundits love ceremonies my queen they wont let anything be done without elaborate never ending rituals with lots of chanting agar incense and bells why are they always so fond of bells i can barely pray with those bells clanging in my ears
1742631 do me the honor of accompanying me in the official ceremonies
1742632 do you even have to ask i will be at your side every minute if you but permit me and if the devas permit i would go with you to lord yamas domain as well
1742633 as always i respect and shall uphold your decision yet do not fault me if i continue to hope that you will yet rule another forty sun years
1742634 my beloved there is nothing more anyone can do the vaids and the seers have done all that is humanly possible the matter is beyond the abilities of all vedic science and arya knowledge
1742635 then let us appeal to those whose abilities are more than human
1742636 i see that you have been binding old wounds and weaving fresh bonds this morning it is a good beginning to an auspicious day
1742637 ayodhya naresh i am pleased to inform you that an even more auspicious event has occurred this fine first day of spring a very great and divine personage has chosen to grace us with his presence i do not know what his arrival here means yet but certainly it is an auspicious and momentous visitation maharaja dasaratha count yourself among the few fortunate kings of ayodhya for you have none other than the renowned seer mage vishwamitra standing at your gates come with me and let us receive him with all ceremony
1742638 you neither shot because its forbidden by maharajas law to carry arms on a feast day or did you forget that during your long rigorous training in the forest at guru vashishtas gurukul
1742639 i dont know about rigorous but it surely was long i was beginning to think we would spend the best years of our lives in that hermitage in the middle of nowhere
1742640 you must feel like you died and went to swarga lok
1742641 maya an illusion like it could vanish at any time
1742642 thats the whole point of those eight years of training to make us realize the illusive seductiveness of luxury and wealth
1742643 enough already i was there too you know right beside you learning all that you learned
1742644 i was just trying to point out that after all those years of study and training it seems so strange to be here again
1742645 do you ever wonder what it would be like to be a free archer
1742646 sometimes i feel like maybe im born in the wrong age like if i had been born a thousand years earlier i would have been out there battling asuras slaying rakshasas by the hundreds
1742647 i feel as if i was made for something more than just governing a kingdom and touching silken robes
1742648 what did you eat for dinner last night brother because i fear youve been stricken with food poisoning
1742649 are you planning to gorge yourself full to bursting on sumptuous morning naashta savories or did you have other more pressing plans
1742650 actually i thought id skip naashta and make for the mango groves rama and i fixed up to meet there at sunrise and its almost time
1742651 last one to the stables is a camels rear end
1742652 see you at the games brother when i win the shield in the archery contest
1742653 long life to you as well my prince rajkumar rama left very early just before dawn we were only just starting to groom the horses i knew you would ask after him so i spoke to his charioteer and samin says he rode out in the direction of the river
1742654 yes my prince he said that the rath horses should be fresh and rested before the holi parade so he took an old battle horse from the kings stables
1742655 and lastly even by error do not mention my old association with him back when he was a king before he became a spiritual man since his reformation and his subsequent elevation to brahmarishi stature vishwamitra does not like to be reminded of his former life
1742656 maharaja dasaratha in keeping with the ancient tradition of gurudakshina between kshatriya and brahmins i have come to ask a boon of you as is the custom i exhort you to agree without hesitation or pause to grant me my hearts desire regardless of what i ask for honor your caste your clan and yourself and agree without delay i vishwamitra sage of sages command it
1742657 did i scare you that was not my intention little beauty i was only eager to be your friend will you not come back to me
1742658 my adherence to tradition is as sincere as any of my illustrious ancestors you have my unhesitant and joyful agreement to fulfill any desire you name as is the custom whatever you wish to ask of me i shall give it without question be it my proudest possession
1742659 ayodhya naresh hum prasan huye you have pleased me greatly with your reply lord of ayodhya now i exhort you to remember this promise you have made me in the sacred presence of your own mahaguru and marg darshak vashishta himself as well as these other associates
1742660 i beg of you give me the honor of performing the customary arghya and welcoming you into my humble abode
1742661 of course but do you not wish to know what boon i am about to ask of you
1742662 madadev i have already sworn to give you whatever your heart desires it would honor me greatly if you would utter your sacred request within the walls of my abode it is not seemly of me to keep you a great and honored guest standing on this public causeway please do me the honor
1742663 stop ayodhya naresh do not debase yourself by touching the feet of this vile creature rise to your feet at once
1742664 you hussy i know what youre up to you wont succeed
1742665 you temptress seductress like a cheap devdasi you lured my husband away from my bed and into your clutches did you think i wouldnt know harlot did you think id give him up without a fight
1742666 how dare you violate the sanctity of my prayer room you have no right to even step into my chambers uninvited and as for calling me those names well you probably picked them up from palace gossip over the years all addressed to your own slinky back they fit you quite well youre the one who tempted my husband from my bed fifteen years ago binding him with a warriors obligation to repay a life debt you used your seductive wiles as boldly as any harlot from the back streets luring him to your arms as if that werent enough you decided you couldnt share his affections you plotted and conspired against me and poor sumitra poisoning dasas ears with god alone knows what rot until he began spending his time only with you how dare you come in here and accuse me of your own sins may the devas strike you down as you stand you brazen hussy now get out of my chambers before i have the guards strip you and throw you out bodily
1742667 if she resists strip her drag her by the hair and throw her out naked into the courtyard
1742668 well kaikeyi are there any other names youd like to call me im sure my personal guards and kinswomen would love to hear you abuse me in their presence
1742669 the second queen wishes to leave now escort her to her own palace
1742670 the first one to lay a finger on me will be executed within the hour
1742671 this isnt over yet you snake mother ill not give up my husband without a fight before nightfall hell be back in my bed and youll be just another unnumbered concubine in the palace of untitled wives
1742672 i heard the commotion and the shouting my guards told me kaikeyi was attacking you in your chambers i came at once is it over are you hurt what did she want the hussy
1742673 shes upset because dasa came to me this morning she thinks i manipulated him somehow to come to me
1742674 i mean of course you wouldnt do such a thing but i mean did he really come to you this morning to speak
1742675 if i were then you would be flat on your back my little sister
1742676 its true my sister you can see the aftermath of his conquest for yourself
1742677 of course i did my share of conquering as well
1742678 in the name of blessed lakshmi wife of divine vishnu
1742679 you men have committed a crime under kosala law you must surrender yourselves to the city magistrates if you are unaware of the laws of our state some leniency might be shown but you must put away your weapons at once and hand them over to the guards at the first gate no weapons are permitted beyond that point
1742680 you young one put down that bow and arrow right now all of you do the same with your weapons at once if you do not obey this will go badly for you
1742681 methinks this will go badly for you boy youre holding up our sport you are
1742682 you move out of the way and let us have our sport with the deer unless you want to join in its fate in which case wed be happy to oblige you
1742683 you go find your mother and bring her to us boy
1742684 for hunting the deer and refusing to put down your arms you will be arrested and tried under ayodhya law the most severe punishment applicable will be meted out to each one of you
1742685 but for that last comment pahadi you are answerable to me
1742686 i like that answerable hey come closer boy ive got the answer youre looking for right here in the crotch of my langot
1742687 throw down your weapons and surrender to me and i will not pursue this further
1742688 dasaratha rise to your feet at once do not debase yourself by bowing before this vile filth rise i command you
1742689 shama mahadev forgive me for pausing in my hospitable duties but i must deal with this insolent intruder who so rudely interrupts our ritual
1742690 guards stop this man and put him on the ground on his belly he has interrupted the sacred arghya reception of our noble visitor by committing this violation of our ancient ritual he has forfeited his rights as a citizen arrest this man at once
1742691 citizen who are you and why do you dare to address your king so insolently
1742692 dasaratha listen very carefully that man standing over there is an impostor i am the real vishwamitra
1742693 insolent man do you wish to be put to the death right here on the street
1742694 dasaratha look at me closely i changed my bhes bhav to enter the city without attracting the attention of your enemies i did not know that this foul demon had already preceded me here by scant moments if i had not come in time you would be lying dead right there before your own gates
1742695 this man is ranting beyond the limits of tolerance let us take him to the dungeons where he will be suitably interrogated
1742696 you must believe me that man is an impostor he is an assassin from lanka sent to kill you before you have a chance to announce the coronation of your son rama tell your soldiers to unhand me or i will have no choice but to use my powers against them
1742697 do not force me to destroy your soldiers i have sworn a sacred vow not to take a life until my tapasya is complete order them to move away and let me deal with the impostor look even now he pretends to be me the foolish creature but his disguise is merely excellent not perfect ask guru vashishta if you do not believe me vashishta speak and save lives
1742698 is this how you greet a visiting seer with insults and abuse from a common citizen i would turn my powers on the insolent wretch and reduce him to ashes in an instant
1742699 an excellent idea vishwamitra why dont you do just that use your power of atma brahman and punish that wretched mortal over there for insulting you the code of the seers demands it as you well know
1742700 come on then impostor vashishta speaks wisely destroy me or be destroyed yourself but know this first you face none other than brahmarishi vishwamitra
1742701 cast down your weapons and there will be no more bloodshed
1742702 so what did these scoundrels do to deserve their wounds
1742703 they were hunting a deer by the riverbank i told them to stop they didnt listen
1742704 two wounded no three and one dead and that young badmash there looks like hes been throwing up more wine than hes been drinking and they all look like the nasty kind the kind who poach on kings lands and dont hesitate to murder wardens over a rabbit snack
1742705 good thinking have some of the wardens take a look at them they might find some familiar faces repeat offenders sumantra did say something about poachers on kings lands this past winter
1742706 why dont you ride to the first gate and have them send an escort for these wretches then maybe we can get to the practice session wed planned i bet you bharat and shatrugan are hard at it already theyre determined to top us in archery as well as the chariot race
1742707 why dont you give your flock a rest for a few moments ill be back before you can finish that kairee
1742708 move aside ayodhyans i have no wish to harm you my business is with that impostor over there he is the intruder and a threat to your king and city not i
1742709 there seems to be a question of identity my esteemed friend this man has challenged your authenticity arent you going to respond in some way
1742710 you will have to do more than claim now assassin prove it
1742711 my word is my proof now begone or be ruined
1742712 i cannot perform an aggressive act impostor it will negate my entire penance i have not endured two hundred and forty years of tapasya in the fetid swamps of the bhayanak van just to be tricked by a shape shifting asura such as yourself as i did with the soldiers i will only defend myself unleash your black sorcery do your worst
1742713 it is time to show your true self now impostor
1742714 kala nemi its been a while since we last met
1742715 he and i have had encounters over the millennia he comes from a very illustrious line of asuras im sure you know him by his family name at least pulastya
1742716 you must be joking this stinking foulness is descended from the sage pulastya
1742717 yes through his son visravas this handsome fellow is visravass brother in fact
1742718 how interesting so that would make him uncle of ravana the self proclaimed king of the rakshasa clans
1742719 i am kala nemi king of rakshasas ravana is merely my nephew i roamed the three worlds long before he was even a mote in my sisters eye
1742720 this matter cannot be settled with swords dasaratha allow us to deal with this intruder in the manner that best befits his race
1742721 i have done the same to all your brave soldiers as well with your royal permission
1742722 so kala nemi you believe yourself to be the true leader of the rakshasa clans do you and yet i would wager my five thousand years of knowledge that it was on your nephew ravanas orders that you came here on this foolish mission
1742723 it was my idea i go where i please do as i please if i choose to let ravana sit on the throne of lanka it is because i prefer to roam free and ravage the cities of you mortals he likes to enjoy the company of his stolen queens and toys it pleases me to leave him to manage my kingdom while i strike terror and cause ruin among your kind
1742724 is that what you intended to do here you dont seem to have been very successful
1742725 if your canny colleague had not exposed me when he did i would have been within the walls of your palace and would be wreaking havoc even at this moment you were fortunate to have been spared my wrath this time
1742726 did you really believe you had fooled me i saw through your disguise the moment i laid eyes on you just as a true sage seer or seer mage has an aura of brahman around his form you asuras have a stench of evil around you i smelled it a mile away
1742727 you lie if you saw through my disguise you would never have let me come so close to maharaja dasaratha
1742728 i could have slit his throat just by flexing my arm
1742729 but then you would never have come close to your real target and then your mission would have been a failure
1742730 if you know who i intended to kill then know this also old seer i will accomplish my mission sooner or later and a day will come not far from now when this gaudy eyesore of a city will lie in smoldering ruins even as we speak the greatest army of asuras ever assembled is preparing to march north ayodhya will fall and after it all of the proud arya nations we masters of the netherworld will possess the world of middle earth that you call prithvi we will crush you like the pathetic bags of meat and water you are mortals and when we have rid all prithvi of every last one of your kind we shall rise to overpower the plane of swarga lok as well land of the devas no power in the three worlds of hell earth and heaven can stop us
1742731 i think we have bantered enough with this pretty boy vishwamitra time to show him how we mortals deal with skulking assassins and rude rakshasas who threaten us with genocide
1742732 do your worst fools i will be back and you will learn painfully as countless mortals before you that it is not for nothing he is named ra van a he who makes the universe scream
1742733 consign this demon to the lowest level of the netherworld to everlasting agony
1742734 forgive me for not recognizing you at first and for treating you so rudely you have saved my life and done all of kosala a great great service my debt to you can never be repaid but if there is any way i can show my gratitude then you have but to ask
1742735 that natural error is not even worth mentioning ayodhya naresh as for being in my debt dont be too quick to offer me gratitude i am about to ask you to give me your most precious possession
1742736 great one whatever you ask for it is yours i swear this in the presence of my mahaguru vashishta by the honor of the arya nations the suryavansha dynasty and ikshvaaku clan the kingdom of kosala and its capital city of ayodhya today you have ensured the survival of all these great lineages name your dakshina and i shall grant it without hesitation
1742737 raje i come to ask for the life of your oldest and most beloved son rama i need him to accompany me on a mission of the greatest danger and importance a mission that could save ayodhya itself surrender his life to me and you shall be forever blessed for your sacrifice
1742738 i couldnt herd the whole bunch of pahadis up through the grove to get him
1742739 it was simpler to walk them straight to the first gate if i hadnt met you on the way i would have just left them with the gate watch turned around and come back for him
1742740 where did you say you left the deer anyway i dont see her down there
1742741 right there look you can see the bloodstains from her wound she must have been well enough to return to the forest after all
1742742 good for her now we can go back to the city and play holi
1742743 havent you had enough practice for one day besides its our first holi in ayodhya in eight years
1742744 luck do you think were too old to play holi
1742745 too old dont you remember all the stories father told us about his playing holi with our mothers and all his other wives as well or how the entire cabinet of ministers got drunk on bhaang and danced the bhangra with each other and these are statesmen who are at each others throats at every cabinet meeting youre never too old to play holi rama holi was created for even the old to act young just for a day at least
1742746 so if we act like little brats today nobody would mind right
1742747 oh nothing much just thought we might find bharat and shatrugan and color their faces as purple as monkeys
1742748 now youre talking like a true arya lets do it
1742749 whats the matter bhai impatient to get your face colored
1742750 well see who gets his face colored first but first were needed back in the palace some pfs brought the message
1742751 the city is on full alert the army was called out
1742752 its all under control now bhai the seer mage vishwamitra arrived to visit father on an urgent mission only a rakshas arrived at the same time disguising himself as vishwamitra there was a lot of confusion but the real vishwamitra and guru vashishta exposed the rakshas and dispatched him using brahman sorcery fathers called us all back to the palace just in case there are more intruders around we should go
1742753 nothing its nothing i just bharats right we should return to the palace as soon as possible we should be within the seventh wall at a time like this
1742754 what say we race back to the first gate order of arrival decides who gets to color the others faces first agreed
1742755 kosala narad ayodhya naresh suryavansha raghuvansha aja putra shrimati maharaj dasaratha rajya sabha mein padhaar rahein hain
1742756 brahmarishi mahadev saprem swami tapasvi mahantya vishwamitra atithi satkar ka swagat hai
1742757 we are greatly honored to have with us here such an illustrious and legendary guest on behalf of this sabha and every citizen of kosala i offer brahmarishi vishwamitra every courtesy and respect sampurn atithi satkar that ayodhya has to offer we are your humble servants mahadev please grace us with your wisdom and tell us how we may serve you
1742758 the blessings of brahma vishnu and siva be upon you and your lineage ayodhya naresh dasaratha i am pleased to be here in the nation of the suryavanshas sadly my business here is not pleasure but necessity as time is of the essence i will come straight to the point it is my unfortunate task to inform you all that the greatest crisis in the history of the arya nations is upon us
1742759 that hasnt happened on a feast day since well since the last asura war
1742760 rajkumaron aap hi kuch kijiye na hummey andar jaane nahi de rahey hain
1742761 you and shot wait here lakshman and i will go talk to them
1742762 looks like these holi revelers came to spend more than just a feast day in our fine city
1742763 the holi celebration lasts seven days it takes most people twice that long to recover from all that carousing and feasting
1742764 you looked like youd seen a rakshasa yourself when bharat and shatrugan told us about the happenings in the city
1742765 something like this you mean a rakshasa invading ayodhya thats quite a coincidence isnt it when did you have this dream maybe if you tell guruji he can interpret it properly maybe your dream was a prophecy
1742766 it was just a stupid dream i dont want to talk about it
1742767 why are you so touchy about it i was only suggesting in the name of siva
1742768 this bunch doesnt need to enter the city theyve got their own holi mela right here
1742769 senapati dheeraj kumar general of the purana wafadars our battalion of veterans of the last asura war
1742770 rajkumars quads of soldiers are already out seeking you and your brothers i have orders
1742771 why are these people not being allowed into the city
1742772 what can i say my prince never before has ayodhya turned away its own brothers and sisters but this is a strange day and i have my orders i am to escort you directly to your fathers palace under my guard
1742773 but what about these people when will they be allowed in theyre not rakshasas and asuras theyre just ordinary commoners wanting to attend the maharajas holi feast
1742774 rajkumar rama what you say is true but the beast that entered earlier was able to change his bhes bhav to resemble the great brahmarishi vishwamitra his devilish deception fooled almost everyone including the gate watch and the maharajas guard and even the maharaja himself
1742775 how are we to know that one of them isnt an asura in disguise too or all of them
1742776 in that case senapati how do you know we arent asuras too my brothers and me
1742777 brahmarishi vishwamitra your dedicated lifelong pursuit of spiritual prowess is a model taught in every gurukul and ashram from the western borders of this great continent to the eastern extremities it was through such rigorous tapas penance
1742778 that you achieved your great deva given prowess in the mastery of brahman pray tell us then what is this necessity that compelled you to interrupt your sacred meditation
1742779 many thanks for your gracious words guru vashishta coming from you those words are high praise indeed for your own prowess as a seer far exceeds my own humble achievements it was you who were responsible for my conversion from a ruling kshatriya maharaja into a spiritual seeker a rishi then a maharishi and eventually a brahmarishi yet my entire life spans barely three thousand years while your own illustrious light has shone for fully seven thousand years i trust that the citizens of this great kingdom of kosala appreciate the great gift of your wisdom as well as the great sacrifice you made when you chose to devote your services as a guru and guide the dynasty of suryavansha in matters spiritual and moral rather than pursue further spiritual ascension
1742780 for had he chosen to continue that path of ascension your guru vashishta would be no less than a deva himself by now i warrant
1742781 but enough about me all of us are eager to hear you explain your alarming comment my friend what is this crisis that faces us
1742782 to know that you need only understand the motive of my present tapas
1742783 it was to ask that the reign of the demon lord of lanka be ended and that he and his minions be flung back for all eternity to the lower world from whence they came
1742784 i see from your reaction good citizens of kosala that you have knowledge of the one of whom i speak
1742785 sadly old friend word of that dark villains evildoing has traveled as far as blessed ayodhya we have some hearsay of the lord of lankas excesses
1742786 that you have only had word and hearsay of his doings for if he had his way that vile creature would invade your city and overrun your proud nation
1742787 maharaj dasaratha has already witnessed firsthand what the lord of lanka is capable of doing the rakshas kala nemi sought to impersonate me in order to get within the walls of the royal palace once inside he would have embarked on a spree of murder and destruction like nothing ever seen before in arya history
1742788 if a single rakshasa is capable of infiltrating the most sacrosanct city in all the arya nations imagine what an entire army of rakshasas could accomplish
1742789 and rakshasas are only one of the several vile species at the command of the lord of lanka
1742790 some of our brave veterans may recall the horrors of martial combat against those terrible legions in the last asura war
1742791 our noble maharaja himself fought at the helm of the united arya armies in those last terrible conflicts in fact it was his extraordinary valor that stemmed the invasion and enabled mortal forces to drive back the asura legions
1742792 guruji rewards me with rich praise for merely performing my duties
1742793 but since those terrible times our intelligence has maintained a careful watch on the activities of lanka
1742794 it was my understanding that while ravana continues to control lanka and the gateway to the netherworld he has not dared to attempt another incursion on mortal territories
1742795 you speak truly raje the asura forces have not dared to encroach on mortal territories since you drove them back across the ocean to their island hell
1742796 yes that is what i just said ravana and his forces were pushed back to lanka and have not dared to cross the ocean and land on the shores of prithvi again
1742797 except of course for the occasional stray rakshasa or other renegade asuras who ventured into the inhospitable peninsula below the southwoods or the creatures that inhabit the jungles of vatsa dandaka and kiskinda and of course the yaksa tribes have always been free of ravanas command
1742798 indeed your knowledge is admirable great son of the suryavanshas yet despite all your precautions the hated asuras have gained a foothold on the continent of patal a sizable one at that
1742799 i hesitate to question your wisdom maharishiji parantu what you suggest is quite impossible as i said our outposts and spies maintain a steady watch on all outlying regions
1742800 and i say once again the asura races have made deep and wide inroads into the uncharted peninsula how you ask in the same way that a new religion or creed spreads through a continent raje not a pure god praising creed like the vedic hindu faith but the way a vile cancerous consumption creeps across the land or like a mist over the mangrove marshes of the eastern lands of banglar
1742801 allow me to explain raje all these years while the arya nations have enjoyed peace and prosperity while your armies have grown soft and gentle with inactivity while the pursuits of culture and civilization have occupied you rather than the bloody arts of warfare and mayhem your enemies have been marshaling their forces today the lord of lanka has an army twenty times greater than the combined forces of all the arya nations
1742802 mahadev even if what you say is true and i do not presume to debate your great wisdom even so the asuras would not dare step on mortal lands again our outposts would instantly relay the word of any impending invasion well in advance and we would choke off their approach even before they broached the rebellious oceans however vast their armies they would never be allowed to land on the blessed soil of prithvi let alone advance a foot of the five thousand yojanas to the gates of ayodhya
1742803 true raje your knowledge of matters military is renowned through the seven nations
1742804 thank you mahadev to continue this asura army you speak of it is still in lanka am i right
1742805 even the largest ships existing today can carry no more than a thousand men
1742806 dasaratha you are indeed a great general but even the greatest senapati cannot be in possession of all the facts that is why i am here today to bring to your notice firsthand these new developments and to show you the flaw in your perception
1742807 true the construction of such a fleet would take decades
1742808 that is why the lord of lanka issued orders for work to be started the day he returned after his ignominious defeat at your hands twenty two years ago
1742809 today close to a hundred thousand ships are ready and are moored in lanka as well as at sea it was on one such vessel that kala nemi the rakshasa we faced down at your gate today traveled to the western shores of kutchha from whence he came on foot if ravana chooses he can invade our world tomorrow landing his forces all across the continent sweeping like a wave of blackness across the arya nations
1742810 the royal sabha is still in attendance the maharaja sends word to all of you to bear with him for a few more moments he will join you the instant the sabha ends he has good news to impart to you on this auspicious holi day the venerated sage brahmarishi vishwamitra will accompany him and grace our holi celebrations today
1742811 my son drishti kumar is in charge of the palace watch today he was required to ensure the security of the sabha hall where the maharaja and sabha are in conference at this minute with the visiting sage he has left word not to let anyone in without his personal accession he will arrive in a moment please excuse the additional delay
1742812 we understand senapati these are part of the standard security procedures during a full alert if you like you may return to your post at the first gate
1742813 if you please rajkumar i shall stay until you are within the gates
1742814 i hope to speak to my father at the earliest and request him to give you leave to open the gates
1742815 as you wish rajkumar however i would advise against it
1742816 do you really fear some of those commoners may be asuras in disguise
1742817 nay i suspect these occurrences happen not in isolation i was a wrestler once as you mayhap recall and among wrestlers we have a game in some parts of the kingdom it is called kho in others kabbadi you rajkumars have probably played it yourself a thousand times
1742818 then you know the goal of the game to infiltrate the enemy square and try to catch out the other players or reach the far end and win the game a simple game with a simple objective
1742819 now suppose that the rakshasa kala nemi was the first player sent by the enemy team to seek out our weaknesses and strengths to see how far he could get before he was stopped or even if he could go all the way and touch our goal line
1742820 perhaps take out some of our key players in the process
1742821 and its credit to our team for having safely ousted their first intruder without a single casualty on our side
1742822 precisely young bharat but do you know what we must do next to follow their play
1742823 our turn we send one of ours into their territory same strategy seek out strengths and weaknesses show them were willing and able to fight back ideally do more harm to them than they did to us otherwise theyll just keep coming back
1742824 you have the lay of it rajkumar shatrugan i have watched you play with my grandsons in the akhada you have great promise
1742825 enter and be welcome princes of ayodhya enter in the name of your father maharaj dasaratha
1742826 captain i hand over the four rajkumars rama bharat shatrugan and lakshman into your possession guard them with your life and honor i bid you leave aagya
1742827 my orders are to escort you directly into the palace and keep you within the protection of the palace guard until your father sends for you
1742828 even if this is indeed as you describe great one ravana would not dare invade without provocation mortals have been at peace with the asura races for twenty three years they would not dare take the first step toward their own annihilation
1742829 maharaj dasaratha you make the ancient mistake of judging the asuras by human standards remember they are not human that is why they are asuras
1742830 let me say this without euphemisms or circumlocution whether twenty years or fifty years from now the asuras will invade it is the only goal of their existence every breath they take is dedicated to this purpose and this purpose alone and they will not rest until they have either invaded and razed the proud cities of the arya nations to the ground or every last one of them is killed in violent combat their goal is total and uncompromising genocide either asuras or mortals will remain to walk the earth they will no longer coexist
1742831 mahadev i do not presume to question your sources of information but my outposts and spies
1742832 your spies are sold your outposts are taken hear me raje
1742833 hear me and know this for fact the lord of lanka has corrupted your spies and every ally south of ayodhya none of them will ever bring you word of your enemies this is why you have not heard anything to alarm you this is why kala nemi was able to travel this far and enter ayodhya undetected so easily
1742834 but its one thing for a single rakshasa in mortal guise to infiltrate our defenses and a completely different matter when you speak of tens of millions of asuras crossing the oceans and invading the entire arya nations
1742835 even if this great host were to make the journey to ayodhya unchallenged then we shall not merely open our gates to them and say come bull gore me
1742836 it is not for nothing that ayodhya is called ayodhya the unconquerable ayodhya anashya and as long as ayodhya stands the arya nations will not yield i tell you
1742837 behold raje even as a cheap jadugar a street magician uses smoke and hypnosis to beguile his innocent audience so has the lord of lanka used his god granted powers to deceive and cloak your great mind
1742838 remember raje this is no ordinary rakshasa king we speak of this is ravana himself he whose thousand yearlong tapasya compelled mighty brahma himself to grant him everlasting life and immunity from all destruction
1742839 we have defeated him before we shall do so again if need be
1742840 even now you protest raje then i must reveal unto you and your court what i was reluctant to speak of until now know this great citizens of ayodhya defenders of the kosala kingdom and guardians of the southernmost borders of the arya nations ravanas power is spreading amongst you even now even as that purple mist is creeping through this assembly he is here in this very sabha hall and is watching us even as we debate amongst ourselves
1742841 what is the meaning of this what do you hope to prove by this demonstration
1742842 it was necessary to demonstrate the extent to which the lord of lanka has corrupted the proud population of the arya nations the smoke you see is in fact the power of brahman manifested in a form made visible for your benefit the mantra i spoke instructed it to seek out and expose those corrupted by the lord of lanka these eleven mortals captured in its divine grasp are nothing more than acolytes and minions of ravana himself
1742843 impossible these are old and trusted courtiers i sit with these men every day and discuss matters of state and defense
1742844 there was no way for you to know this is the vile power of ravanas sorcery he has eyes and ears within your very court his spies live beneath the same roof that you inhabit in the very heart of ayodhya and for every one you see here there are a thousand others throughout your proud kingdom this is how ravana has struck back at you for defeating him in the last asura war he has corrupted your own people and converted them to his evil cause
1742845 on your way citizen the savory stalls are up ahead and to the right along sarayu marg on the way to the parade grounds this is pf business
1742846 at ease veterans i only wish to know what happened do you recognize me
1742847 im rama captain drishti kumar and my brothers are following after me theyll confirm it now tell me quickly what happened here
1742848 some tantriks went berserk said one of the maharajas queens had assassinated one of their number they wanted to take a petition to the maharaja to protest the mans murder and demand he institute an inquiry at once
1742849 whats to say the citys on full alert our orders are to let nobody through to the palace and to arrest any potential troublemakers the lieutenant told them to put their protest through official channels they became surly about it it turned ugly fast
1742850 thats the cleanup now while they were scuffling with our men some brahmins came up and began screaming something about the tantriks stealing little boys from some orphanage for sacrifices and suchlike i dont know any more we were only called in a moment ago to keep rubberneckers away from this end of avenue
1742851 pai s t pai i fought with your uncle janaks regiment in the mithila brigade
1742852 thank you sipahi pai youll have to let me through now
1742853 youd know the names of maharaja janaks daughters then of course you being rajkumar rama after all
1742854 of course we played together as children before my brothers and i left for the gurukul
1742855 sita urmila mandavi and kirti although of course you know that mandavi and kirti are maharaja janaks late brothers daughters whom he raised as his own
1742856 my brother lakshman has a soft spot for urmila as most people do but ive always thought sita was the beauty of the lot
1742857 aye that she is forgive me my rajkumar this is a strange day
1742858 in the name of maharaja dasaratha your king and ruler i rajkumar rama chandra command you all to lay down your arms at once
1742859 he must have seen something happening and didnt want to wait for the gates to open again
1742860 i wish i had my mace i feel naked without a weapon
1742861 no bearing weapons on feast days shatrugan you know the law
1742862 come on lakshman that rakshasa didnt follow the law did he whatever rama saw happening it wasnt any lovers fallout i can bet you that he saw trouble and the best way to face trouble is with sharp steel
1742863 youre the limit shatrugan not every problem can be solved with violence
1742864 well when you meet your first rakshasa you try kissing and cajoling all right me ill settle for a good gandahari mace any day
1742865 i have no choice i must be well to see our people through this crisis
1742866 what did we do wrong old friend i governed wisely and justly did i not i built on the works of my ancestors raising ayodhya and kosala to new heights of prosperity and peaceful harmony did i not then why am i plagued by these disasters in the twilight of my reign
1742867 maharaj you are the greatest king of your line the greatest to sit on the sunwood throne never before have the arya peoples enjoyed this long a period of peace and security your works shall be remembered for millennia to come do not blame yourself for the evil wrought by asuras
1742868 perhaps you are right sumantra yet i cannot stand to leave this legacy to my sons what else do we fight for in our youth and prime if not the future and this is not the future i envisioned
1742869 the future may not be as bleak as you fear never before in the history of the arya nations have we been so strong so rich so powerful at the end of the last asura war when you led that fateful foray against the dark lord of lanka all seemed lost we were outnumbered and outmatched exhausted and decrepit yet we won and won triumphantly today we are not only far stronger than then we have the vidya gained from those martial encounters our military strategists have had decades to study the strengths and weaknesses of the asura races our population is almost twice as large as it was then and you see how auspiciously things have begun for us instead of drawing first blood as they hoped the asuras have lost their chief spy and infiltrator no ordinary rakshasa but the dread kala nemi himself blood kin of ravana their spies in the royal court have been outed even now they are being interrogated in the dungeons below the city jailhouse soon we shall root out every traitor and asura sympathizer in the kingdom word has been dispatched to the other arya nations to do the same after this cleansing the war council will convene here in ayodhya take hope and courage my beloved raje we shall not only prevail we shall triumph and yours shall be the foot that descends to crush each one of ravanas ten skulls
1742870 the devas grant that it shall come to pass exactly as you say
1742871 it shall i am willing to give my last breath to see it does and so is every arya citizen be not fearful raje be proud you have built a great nation and now you shall see the fruits of your labor
1742872 i shall take a little rest now before speaking with the brahmarishi vishwamitra on the other reason for his visit he wishes to do so privately are my sons safely back in the palace
1742873 they should be your highness captain drishti kumar went to secure their entry into the palace gates earlier
1742874 i shall look into it myself maharaj as long as the rajkumars reached the palace gates they will surely be safe but i shall check personally depend on me
1742875 i do sumantra this is a strange day and i expect stranger things yet make sure my sons are well and safe
1742876 no my lord i beg you do not abandon me i shall do penance to atone for my error i shall never utter that filthy word again i beg you
1742877 whatever you say it will be done i will not fail thee again
1742878 my lord if you will it i can go into that sabha hall and use my powers to destroy them all
1742879 first you disappear all morning and what a morning and then manthara vanishes without telling me where shes going and your father lets not even start on him i dont know whats gotten into him today nobody in this palace seems to care a damn about me anymore
1742880 when she gets like that it makes me so mad id like to grab her fleshy shoulders and shake her until she just shuts up
1742881 yeah she is isnt she if only shed use some of that kshatriya strength to fight rakshasas instead of taking it out on poor bharat
1742882 i dont know maybe bharat shouldnt be such a victim too i mean he could stand up to her once in a while hes not a milk drooling babe anymore
1742883 shes his mother lakshman and never mind him do you think either of us could raise our voice to her
1742884 anyway at least hes learned to deal with it he doesnt let her feed him like a stuffed boar like when he was a kid
1742885 you boys must be hungry lets finish your aarti and you can have your naashta
1742886 i had to spend half the morning keeping kaikeyi maa company while she ate her breakfast my stomachs grumbling too
1742887 as usual doesnt she know to wait and do bharats aarti first
1742888 i dont understand that woman does she drink a cup of bile every night before sleeping shes always so full of bitterness for everything and everybody you wont believe the scene she made in chambers this morning i thought the rakshasas had invaded the palace anyway lets not talk about such ashubh things before pooja we all have a long day ahead
1742889 he has decided that you are to be king on his passing he wishes to crown you prince heir on your sixteenth birthday this very month
1742890 to prepare the kingdom for your coronation with great pomp and ceremony he is very proud of you
1742891 it is your birthright as you know you are next in line for the throne it is your place to be king after he is gone
1742892 and what of you what of your place the place you were denied the humiliations you bore silently the betrayal and the infidelity the negligence will those be restored to you as well will his passing magically make everything all right
1742893 he does not have long to live he wishes to make amends he has already reconciled with me and i have accepted
1742894 what do you mean accepted mother how could you accept him back in the space of a single morning when his negligence has spanned a decade and a half
1742895 and i am still his wife we walked seven pheras around the sacred fire that sacred bond cannot be undone
1742896 and where do you stand after this this royal change of heart
1742897 i want this for you rama i want to see you crowned king its my lifes greatest wish nothing would make me happier try to understand
1742898 i understand everything i understand that youre willing to forget all and forgive him for the sake of my future to put aside your long silent suffering just so that i can sit on the throne of ayodhya
1742899 no rama that isnt entirely true i am done with the anger and the suffering im ready to put it behind me i want to go forward now to make a new beginning i want to celebrate holi today with my son and my husband and begin a new season of happiness i want to enjoy this new blessing that god has given me once again and be content with it for as long as it lasts heed my words son put aside your anger i believe your father is sincere and genuinely repentant forget his past mistakes accept his ashirwaad and the crown of ayodhya
1742900 dont let your anger for your father cloud your judgment you are a suryavanshi prince the rightful heir to the throne accept your place in the dynasty ascend the throne you were born to occupy this is beyond any personal feelings this is a matter of history and destiny
1742901 if queens can be replaced at will so can crown princes who knows what plans his other wife has in store for us in the future
1742902 you go too far remember who you are as your mother i forbid you from speaking another word against your father
1742903 put the past away make a new beginning today rama this is no accidental reconciliation it was meant to be whatever is done is done it no longer matters the only thing that matters is what lies ahead face it with an open and free mind accept it accept your dharma
1742904 it is your dharma to fulfill your fathers wishes to take his place on the throne of ayodhya to rule your people justly and wisely these things you must do without doubt or question these have nothing to do with his negligence of me or our long estrangement those are insignificant in the larger context yes i have forgiven and forgotten all lapses just in the space of one morning yet i do not demand or even request that you do the same it is your decision to make what i do demand is that you honor your parents and ancestors and heritage your dharma calls out to you answer it wisely
1742905 the king wishes to see prince rama in his chambers at once
1742906 pranaam respected guest you honor us with your visit i pray if you find this humble kshatriya worthy grant me your ashirwaad i shall be eternally blessed
1742907 it is a strange and disturbing day in our history the arrival of our exalted guest on the auspicious day of holi purnima would be an occasion to celebrate with twice the customary pomp yet other events have occurred to cast a shadow over our great city
1742908 they are now in the city jail being interrogated by mantri jabali who has some expertise in these matters
1742909 at the maharajas order the sabha was dismissed and a state of emergency declared in the city its believed that an entire network of asura sponsored spies exists throughout the kingdom perhaps even throughout the arya nations and an emergency plenary session of the war council will be held a week from today to discuss how best to attack and destroy this network
1742910 captain drishti kumar told us that something strange had happened but nobody seems to be sure exactly what it was
1742911 it was like a mist had descended to cloud everyones mind
1742912 we have been hearing strange rumors from the rakshaks for a while now
1742913 and last month there was a courier from mithila who delivered a message from maharaja janak and left here safely but never reached mithila
1742914 and ayodhya is the target we have not seen the last of these unnatural events
1742915 indeed rajkumar rama it is just as you say the lord of lanka has spread his net far and wide all these years now he begins to pull it in one patch at a time if we do not act swiftly and decisively we will live to see a reign of terror such as no arya nation has ever witnessed
1742916 would that it were possible sadly young prince asuras do not parley this war has too long and bloody a history for peace to be even an option any longer
1742917 my father taught me that peace is always an option
1742918 and he taught you well but this is no ordinary adversary these are asuras eternal enemies of the devas and as long as we worship the devas as our gods we can never be at peace with the asuras
1742919 but there was a cessation of hostilities once before we mortals were created the devas and asuras came to an understanding and put down their weapons
1742920 and guru vashishta too has taught you well you know your history you speak of the amrit manthan and so you must also know the outcome of those peaceful negotiations
1742921 the devas churned the ocean to produce the nectar of immortality amrit but when the time came to give equal portions to the devas and the asuras the devas tried to cheat them because they feared that once the asuras became immortal too they would be unstoppable
1742922 still it is good to find a kshatriya prince who speaks of peace young rama chandra if only there were a way to end this war without violence
1742923 i have sensed spirals and wisps of kala jaadu in the ether it saddens me to see the presence of evil in the heart of such a noble city
1742924 respected father great guru vashishta we must root out this evil at once let me lead the hunt for these treacherous rats i will wash the gutters of the city with their black blood and cleanse our great capital of this evil intrusion
1742925 shanti my prince control your emotions angry haste is not the way to deal with this problem
1742926 our illustrious visitor has interrupted his two hundred forty year penance for the precise purpose of aiding us in this new war
1742927 well spoken once again young prince but nevertheless this conflict was begun and not by your hand or ours all that is within our power is the chance to end it
1742928 impossible even the gods could not end the asura wars and not for want of trying you have just said so yourself great one how can we mere mortals do what the gods cannot
1742929 nevertheless dasaratha we cannot stop trying even the impossible must be attempted if only in the hope of eventual success
1742930 then as kshatriyas and defenders of the arya peoples we must act that is our dharmic duty is it not mahadev besides we have no choice in the matter the asuras made the first move they violated the truce and infiltrated our city we cant just stand by and wait for them to invade and destroy our kingdom we must go to war now
1742931 there will be no talk of war in my lifetime
1742932 bharat my son you know the price we paid nay are still paying for the last war i swore a vow then that that was the last time we would pitch our war tents and go to battle against the asuras if you honor me then respect and uphold that vow
1742933 these demons are demons they will act as demons we can still act as humans
1742934 enough no more argument from you there will be no more talk of war here today or any day from this day onward
1742935 i will not see those dark ages return to this land not as long as there is still breath in my body
1742936 i have said this to you a hundred times already sage why do you not relent
1742937 dasaratha be reasonable what i offer is an antidote to war an end to the endless cycle of karmic violence and bloodshed that have plagued us since the beginning of time a permanent peace in the three worlds of patal prithvi and swarga lok
1742938 your antidote is worse than the venom it seeks to cure mahadev i have told you already it is unthinkable to give you what you demand ask anything else of me and you shall have it
1742939 ayodhya naresh your decision is not a wise one i ask you yet again reconsider
1742940 honored one even another hundred years were i blessed enough to live that long which i doubt would not make me reconsider my decision what i said before is final and binding
1742941 it is not in the nature of a seer let alone a brahmarishi to repeat oneself nor should you deny your clan oaths and defy the code of the kshatriya but because the suryavansha dynasty and the ikshvaaku clan from whence you spring are so so renowned for their service to the seers i repeat my request one more time for the benefit of your sons these fine and proud young princes of ayodhya
1742942 hear me o lord and ruler of ayodhya seat of mighty kosala greatest of the arya nations of the world grant me the dakshina i demand by right and we may yet pull out the thorn before the bush grows beyond our reach
1742943 sage i cannot sacrifice the life of my son at the altar of your faith
1742944 you would rather sacrifice the lives of your people instead
1742945 if such be the will of the gods so be it
1742946 father forgive my naivete but may i ask what exactly is this dakshina that brahmarishi vishwamitra desires and why do you break the code of the kshatriya by refusing to grant him his dakshina
1742947 he wishes to conduct a great yagna this is the culmination of his two hundred forty years of penance but each time his purohits prepare the sacred altar for the yagna rakshasas defile its sanctity and disrupt the preparations even as we speak the propitious time for the completion of the yagna is wasting he must complete the ritual within the next fourteen days in order to achieve his spiritual goal to this end he interrupted his penance and came to ayodhya today to request protection against the rakshasas
1742948 but father this is the essence of the kshatriya code to protect those who cannot will not or must not fight we are sworn to protect the seers and brahmin classes with our lives just as they are sworn to teach us all knowledge and guide us spiritually why do you refuse such a request
1742949 rama i have already offered him the services of my best warriors my purana wafadar battalion my entire army is at his disposal i can do no less for as you say it is our sacred duty to protect and to serve the holy men yet the brahmarishi rejects all my offers and insists on his own choice of protector
1742950 he insists on sending you my son even though he knows full well that even my mighty army was once routed by this king of demons indeed i would not be sitting here before you today were it not for the intervention of your clan mother kaikeyi who saved my life not once but twice on that same battlefield this ravana is no ordinary rakshasa rama as my own wounds testify
1742951 let me go then father i shall protect the brahmarishi and see his yagna completed successfully offer him my sword and service
1742952 you are brave and bold as your namesake bharat well did i name you after the great founder of the arya nations great bharata himself but alas this too is not acceptable to the brahmarishi its rama that he wants to accompany him back to the forest
1742953 then let me go with him i will be blessed to perform such a great service
1742954 you see dasaratha even he is willing to go with me now you have no argument left to oppose me
1742955 he does not understand sage he is young and inexperienced you are one of the seven seers the asuras can no more harm you than they can harm the flow of brahman itself you are virtually immortal and invulnerable shielded by mandalas mantras and dev astras divine weapons and shields given to you by the devas themselves but my rama is merely a mortal boy he is no match for asuras sent by the lord of lanka he does not even have the full measure of these demons
1742956 what can a fifteen year old boy do against such creatures rakshasas no less rama is fresh from the gurukul barely of marriagable age he should be out right now playing holi with his brothers and friends enjoying the prime of his youth celebrating the spring of his life not listening to this weary debate he is too young for such matters he is no more fit to fight ravanas two strongest demons than i am fit to fight ravana himself at my age and in this condition
1742957 he may surprise you yet raje after all he is your son
1742958 do not persist in this exorbitant demand mahadev i beg of you today at the spring feast i am to announce his succession in less than one fortnight on his sixteenth naming day he will be crowned heir to the throne of ayodhya have a care for his future if not for his youth
1742959 i care a great deal about his future ayodhya naresh that is why i promised you that i would bring him back safe and sound before the date of the coronation you have my word on it the word of one of the seven seers
1742960 shama mahadev ask of me anything other than this i cannot give you my firstborn take anything you will from me but not my rama
1742961 so be it then dasaratha i have no more business here i take my leave good day
1742962 i entreat you stay a moment this matter is not done yet there are still words left to be spoken
1742963 i have heard all the words that matter nothing more remains to be said
1742964 in the name of our shared status as brahmarishis i request you earnestly come back to the dais give us but a moment to confer to leave thus would be a great insult to the honor of the house suryavansha and the clan ikshvaaku
1742965 any insult here was given by your maharaja it was my honor that was sullied now he must live with the consequences of his decision
1742966 then pray give me but a moment to repair those insults and undo this mistake for it is a mistake i assure you the house of suryavansha is known for its munificence dasarathas own ancestor maharaja harishchandra gave away his entire wealth as guru dakshina and noble raghu had already bankrupted his royal treasury by gifting all he owned as dakshina to one rishi when he was called upon by another rishi to deliver a fabulous sum as guru dakshina raghu obtained the amount from kuber lord of wealth and fulfilled his sacred obligation for the second time the seat of ayodhya has ever been known for its adherence to dharma
1742967 your words contradict those of your king great guru look even now he sits there silent while you implore me on his behalf
1742968 and brahmarishi vishwamitra both of you have reached an impasse one asserts the right of a brahmin to demand dakshina from a kshatriya the other asserts the right of a father to preserve the life of his son this debate could rage forever without an end nor would i have you fling insults at one another
1742969 when manu lawmaker the first maharaja of kosala was crowned in this very chamber and on that very sunwood throne he laid down two laws by which he would govern those two laws determine all life and death decisions in ayodhya even today rajkumar rama would you tell us what those two laws are
1742970 the first law is to obey dharma at all costs
1742971 for dharma is the moral code by which the pillar of arya character stands upright
1742972 the second law is that the maharaja rules not for himself his dynasty clan varna or family he rules for the people if he makes a decision that affects the people then it must meet with the peoples consent
1742973 maharaja dasaratha do you deny the second law of manu
1742974 of course not gurudev the maharajas of ayodhya have always ruled only at the peoples behest
1742975 then there is the solution to your vexing dilemma abjure any further discussion on this matter proceed with the holi ritual prayers and festivities when you stand before the citizens of ayodhya on the mela grounds today confront them with the question let them decide if rajkumar rama is to go with vishwamitra or stay here in ayodhya ask ayodhya to decide
1742976 look at how perfectly theyre chanting together thats how maa prema always tells us to chant and we can never do it so well
1742977 a lakh is a hundred thousand there arent even ten thousand purohits there leave alone a lakh
1742978 well i can never figure out number counting but there sure are a lot of bald heads on that wagon arent there nandini
1742979 and the parade hasnt even started yet just wait till you see the royal wheelhouse pass its a hundred yards long divided into four sections of twenty five yards each joined by little bridges so you can walk from one end to the other without getting out of the chariot
1742980 i thought you said it was a wheelhouse not a chariot
1742981 and then you have to see the battle elephants theyre so beautiful there are lakhs of them in the royal army but of course they cant parade them all at once so they only bring out a few from each akshohini thats a division of the army one akshohini consists of 21 870 elephants 21 870 chariots 65 610 horsemen and 109 350 foot soldiers the army of ayodhya has 25 akshohini while another 15 akshohini are quartered around the kingdom at various places
1742982 and keep the guardsmen talking after they finish with you men can talk ten times as long as they can love thats something you must know by now sreelata
1742983 that i do they really can talk cant they oh look whats that big chariot coming up now the one with all the gold carvings and conch bearers getting ready to blow their conchs is it the royal chariot i mean wheelhouse
1742984 no silly thats just the conch bearer chariot its the first of the royal procession look theyre blowing their conchs now thats to let us know the royal procession is coming up
1742985 why do you want to ask him to visit us at the temple
1742986 so your heart is lost to prince rama huh well then you had better be that one in a crore girl because hes sworn to take only one wife in his lifetime
1742987 hes the prince heir he can have a thousand wives if he wants
1742988 thats the point he can but he wont i hear hes sworn to find just one wife
1742989 maybe it has something to do with his father having so many wives if you know what i mean
1742990 look theres the royal wheelhouse and in the front riding on those four horses are the princes look the handsome one in front with the dark almost bluish rama isnt he gorgeous oh i could just eat him alive
1742991 today we have among us a legendary and illustrious guest guru vashishta has already extolled the story of his ascension from a bold warrior king to the exalted brahmanic stature he holds today the brahmarishi vishwamitra needs no further introduction but what most of you may not yet know is that he brings us disturbing tidings
1742992 there is no reason to be alarmed i know that the town criers as well our own efficient gossip mills have spread the news of what transpired in the sabha this morning yes there is a very real asura threat confronting us even as you enjoy your holi feast the war council of the arya nations is preparing to convene and i promise you we will find ways to deal with and crush this possible threat without delay rest assured that your liege will seek the quickest and least violent solution to the problem you will be kept informed of further developments as they happen
1742993 but there is another matter that is more pressing right now the brahmarishi has come to me with the traditional demand for guru dakshina as you know it is the sworn duty of any kshatriya to immediately and unhesitantly grant the guru dakshina without question the aryaputra suryavansha ikhsvaaku kshatriya line has filled the chronicles of bharatvarsha with such legendary tales of generosity and munificence and yet the brahmarishis demand is so unusual that it behooves me to share it with you my people for his request is nothing more or less than that i grant him the services of my son rama
1742994 i shall explain the brahmarishi is performing a yagna at his ashram in the southwoods it is part of our greater attempt to protect ourselves from the asura menace it is imperative that his yagna be performed successfully and according to vedic rites but his ashram is threatened by rakshasas
1742995 were these ordinary pooja violaters common outlaws or outcastes i would not think twice
1742996 three of these rakshasas dispatched by the rakshas king ravana himself and backed by untold numbers of accomplices are breeding in the bhayanak van they make it impossible for the completion of the brahmarishis yagna or for any attempt to purify the woods they are said to be desperate vile beasts capable of doing anything to ensure that the brahmarishis yagna is not completed successfully against these deadly beasts the brahmarishi wishes me to send my son prince rama to stave them off while he and his purohits perform the sacred yagna before the sacred full moon of holi purnima waxes to awamas this is the guru dakshina he desires
1742997 it is at the wise suggestion of our esteemed guru vashishta that i place this matter before you beloved ayodhya for before i even knew of the brahmarishis arrival or any of the other happenings in the southwoods i had arrived at the decision to declare before you all this morning my intention to crown my eldest heir prince rama chandra the liege heir of our kingdom
1742998 rama is to be crowned prince heir on the tenth day of the new moon of chaitra the sixteenth anniversary of his birth i promise you friends that before you have entirely cast off the hangover of todays holi feast and celebration you will be fasting to prepare for a jubilee unparalleled in the history of our kingdom mark the day well in your horoscopes it is the day a new star will rise in the suryavansha universe
1742999 there will be as many pedas as you can eat for a month and much much else besides
1743000 but you will recall that i began by telling you about my samasya on the one hand i am a father and a king eager to see my eldest son appointed to the throne in my stead after all i will not live forever despite the heartfelt wishes of you my friends on the other hand i am bound by the honor of the ikshvaaku clan and the suryavansha dynasty by the tradition and heritage of the arya forefathers who seeded this mighty nation before venturing northward to foreign lands where they settled the germanic wildwoods i am compelled by the repositories of our knowledge the shastras and vedas that guide us in all we do and finally by the code of the kshatriya that asserts the duty of every warrior king or common foot soldier to grant his gurus wish for guru dakshina without question or hesitation above all i am governed by dharma
1743001 dharma demands that i fulfill the wish and send my son rama chandra now officially your crown prince in waiting into the southwoods to face and combat deva knows what danger
1743002 i was troubled and conflicted by the brahmarishis request i admit this freely which father would not be yet dharma demanded i obey the quandary might have gone unresolved even now except that guru vashishta the venerable and infinitely wise mentor of my line offered a brilliantly simple suggestion it is on his advice that i do what i do now
1743003 you whose penance exalted our entire race and inspired us all you whose devotion won the admiration of mighty brahma himself who saw fit to grant you the mastery of brahman the force that created sustains and nourishes the universe i bow before you great one
1743004 my answer to your request for guru dakshina is this great one you ask for prince rama i say prince rama is not mine to give because of his seniority and birth he is the natural and true heir to the throne of ayodhya so he belongs to the people whom he is birth sworn to serve all his natural life he belongs to ayodhya to every one of us assembled here today dharma itself demands that a member of the ruling dynasty place his peoples needs before his own so even rama himself cannot decide his own actions purely for his own selfish benefit he must act in the best interests of the people he serves if you wish to have the services of prince rama you must ask those to whom he truly belongs ask ayodhya
1743005 your maharaja is wise indeed and greatly versed in dharma he speaks truly prince rama chandra belongs to you the people he was born to serve and it is you who must decide for yourselves whether my demand for guru dakshina should be fulfilled but before you do so you must know that he will not be risking his life for the successful fulfillment of my yagna alone this mission that he will be called on to execute is for the greater good of all humankind at large including ayodhya
1743006 but i am no statesman or liege my meaning will be best conveyed by giving you a glimpse of what might unfold should my words go unheeded the images i am about to show you will speak for themselves i give you the invasion of ayodhya
1743007 fear not ayodhya this was but an illusion a vision of what might be one possible future that lies in store for you if the dark lord of lanka has his way then this vision will become reality within this year itself just before winter falls when ayodhya is most vulnerable to seige he has prepared for this day for centuries for he whom the gods named ravana is no ordinary rakshasa as you know he is destined to become ruler of the three worlds one day
1743008 hold steady brave ayodhya the wisdom of the devas is infinite for every ravana they allow to seep into creation like a pus boil on a diseased animal they also create an antidote this is why we proud inhabitants of the land of the aryas have been blessed with an infinite number of avatars of the one true god the progeny of the devas are limitless in number and power ravana can and must be defeated as your noble maharaja has said he and your kingdoms rulers will find a way to combat the asura menace before it reaches the banks of the sarayu and threatens the arya nations this too has been prophesied
1743009 but before we can even address that issue of ravana we must first show him that he has met a foe more formidable than any he has ever fought before today he issued a challenge to your honor he sent one of his most trusted aides his own uncle no less into the heart of this great city his mission it can only be surmised was to wreak havoc and slaughter in the royal family
1743010 this was no mere intrusion it was a test and a challenge ravana wishes to know if we are prepared to withstand him or to simply roll over like a meek pup and beg his mercy what do you think ayodhya what would be your response to the lord of lanka fright or fight
1743011 i thought no less and yet it is important to give ravana this answer in a manner that befits his asking of the question to gather up an army and march to lanka would be an overreaction perhaps that is what he hopes for because then he would have the upper hand as he had before during the last asura war no that would be too strong and premature a response he sent a single champion into our midst we must do the same
1743012 into the southwoods the dread bhayanak van which he has created and maintained as a barrier between the arya nations and the great southern subcontinent for millennia he has curbed the progress of the aryas at this geographical barrier by creating an environment so hostile and threatening to mortals that even our remote ashrams have been installed only after great cost to our brave warriors
1743013 you wonder then if the bhayanak van is so dangerous then how would our champion survive it
1743014 now you ask who then shall we send which young untested warrior do i speak of who can undertake this deadly mission and accomplish its goal successfully i ask you in turn ayodhya if ravana could risk his own blood uncle can we do any less you must send no less than your greatest son of all your prince and just titled prince heir rama chandra
1743015 maharaja dasaratha has already offered me his entire army his greatest warriors his most accomplished champions but i say nay to all these what will ravana think if we send a whole force to fight his small force of berserkers or even our best champions the rakshasas of bhayanak van are dangerous true but ravana has other champions far greater and deadlier his own eldest son is not named indrajit without reason the boy earned the title when he defeated mighty indra king of the devas during the asura invasion of indraprastha the capital city of the gods nay only a single warrior can send the message we wish to give ravana
1743016 young rama will not be alone i will be beside him every step of the way i shall prepare him en route to face the perils ahead i shall gift him with the most potent maha mantras ever created for martial combat when he enters the bhayanak van he will be alone true but he will have the power of a thousand kshatriya veterans when we have cleared the bhayanak van of ravanas vile filth the rajkumar and i shall proceed to my ashram where he shall defend my purohits and myself as we conduct the yagna of which i spoke earlier thereby we shall sanctify that forbidden land and make it hospitable at long last for arya inhabitation bear in mind people i do not ask you this favor idly i know well of what i speak it is a seemingly impossible task i admit yet sometimes a single man can do what vast nations cannot
1743017 and so i ask you as is my right according to the code of the kshatriyas and brahmins give me prince rama chandra as my guru dakshina and i will give you a champion give me your crown heir for this mission and i will help strike an important first blow in this new war against the asuras give me this boy warrior to wield as a weapon against the berserkers who threaten my yagna and i will prove to you as well as to ravana that under the guidance and tutelage of a brahmarishi such as myself even a single inexperienced kshatriya can defeat a horde of rakshasas grant me this guru dakshina for ayodhyas future and humankinds sake
1743018 but can a young stripling truly face a force of rakshasas
1743019 under the tutelage of brahmarishi vishwamitra even a carpenter could face them
1743020 not just any young stripling mind its prince rama he speaks of
1743021 god forbid that the prince should come to any harm but even if he were to die fighting the demons it would be a noble sacrifice for a good cause
1743022 if a son of ayodhya must go better it should be our proudest son if maharaj dasaratha agrees to send his own scion then every father in the arya nations will not hesitate to send his own heirs into battle against the asuras
1743023 yatha raja tatha praja yatha raja tatha praja yatha raja tatha praja
1743024 i beg your leave to go with my brother on his sacred mission
1743025 my son how can you even ask such a thing of me it is ramas karma to go i understand and accept that now as i have accepted the will of the people and the desire of the great brahmarishi but do not ask me to sacrifice another son to this terrible task it is perilous enough for one kshatriya yet with the blessings of the devas i pray that he shall return victorious but with two of you the chances of mortal harm increase twofold i cannot brook such a thought please lakshman dont ask this of me
1743026 father i have never asked you for anything but you know that from the time i could stand ive stood beside rama when he would not eat i starved when he laughed i was happy we have never been separated for a moment by any force do not separate us now
1743027 father forgive me for speaking out of turn but i wish to say something to lakshman my brother stay the shadow of the asura threat hangs over ayodhya still your bow will be needed here should any more intruders come you saw the brahmarishis warning of what might come to pass
1743028 but rama you heard him yourself the reason he wishes to take you into the bhayanak van is to prevent that invasion from taking place by going with you i will help prevent it more effectively than staying here besides one bow more or less in ayodhya will not matter much while in the forest it would double the chances of success
1743029 maharaj i have no opinion in this matter this is a fathers and mothers decision to make not a gurus if rajkumar lakshman wishes to accompany his brother so be it if he stays that is acceptable to me as well
1743030 he speaks the truth he and rama share a bond that is beyond this mortal plane if he were to stay back he would pine and waste away in the woods at least they will look out for each other
1743031 do you know what youre saying you would risk the life of your own son even when not required rama is honor bound to go now lakshman does not have to take this great risk think before you speak my gentle queen
1743032 do you think it doesnt hurt me to say it
1743033 its like pulling a piece of my heart from my breast but then i say if i can endure the pain of sending rama then i can endure the pain of sending lakshman as well that way double the pain will halve the risk at least
1743034 i cannot speak for bharat but i would send shatrugan as well
1743035 rama is as much a son of my heart if not of my body to lose him would be as unbearable as to lose my own birth sons so i say if lakshmans going gives him satisfaction if the presence of one more bow improves the chances of success then why should i not send my son as well
1743036 very well then so be it lakshman shall go with rama
1743037 but none other than lakshman leave me at least half my sons in this time of crisis
1743038 bharat shatrugan father is ailing if for any reason imaginable we should fail in our mission ayodhya will need your ax and your mace stay and defend our mothers and our city
1743039 you must make haste the brahmarishi desires to reach ananga ashrama before sunfall you have a great walk ahead
1743040 ayushmaanbhav ayodhya ke rajkumaron hum tumhari safalta ke liya prathna karenge
1743041 father have faith in us we shall bring you triumph
1743042 oh my sons my sons what have i done can i never do right by you what have i done to deserve this cursed karma
1743043 you have always done right by us father its not your karma but our dharma that leads us where we go
1743044 so young and yet so wise if i have ever done anything to deserve a boon from the devas i pray for your safe return both of you
1743045 heed the words of your new guru carefully and obediently care for one another as well as for yourselves guard each others backs night and day do as your gurus have taught you and as your duty demands fulfill your dharma
1743046 be brave young rajkumars it is a great thing you go to do today a noble undertaking your names shall be writ large in the chronicles of your dynasty and your line go now with the grace of the devas i shall use every power at my disposal to pray for your speedy and safe return
1743047 i give you my word ayodhya naresh either i shall return both your sons safely to you once my mission is accomplished or i shall not return at all
1743048 my son was to be crowned maharaja my son bharat not rama bharat
1743049 before he can be crowned maharaja he must be crowned prince heir and then he must wait for his father to resign the throne or die that is the law of ascension
1743050 i want my son to be king you said it would happen you said his kundalee is that of a king not a mere lord or thakur you promised me he would become maharaja
1743051 then why was rama declared crown prince today answer that you bitch
1743052 never lay a hand on me again my queen next time your fall will not be cushioned
1743053 what difference does it make i can do it thats all that matters to you just remember you sniveling spoilt arya she whelp youve grown much too old to slap and spank and i dont have the patience i used to
1743054 you mentioned bharats kundalee yes his horoscope clearly says he will be maharaja and he will be all in good time
1743055 but there is work to be done to make that come to pass
1743056 instead of playing with your overmuscled wrestlers in gloomy inns at night you will have to do as i say time is short and every moment counts in this game
1743057 yes that is exactly what she must do your genius knows no bounds my lord
1743058 dont pretend that you want bharats ascension for his sake you havent a selfless bone in your body kaikeyi if you ever did have one then i must have broken it years ago no all you care about is your own status as second queen you fear that if rama were to ascend the throne kausalya would cut you down to size quickly enough taking revenge on you lor warming dasarathas bed these many years you fear the loss of your unlimited allowance your river of silks and trinkets that flow from the maharajas generosity you fear that with dasarathas passing you will be relegated to the status of a widow banished to some remote corner of the kingdom there to spend the rest of your days in nameless ignominy this is your true motivation in wanting bharat to be crowned prince of ayodhya
1743059 have no fear it shall be as you desire your son shall be crowned prince heir to be crowned maharaja on his fathers passing and you shall retain your status as the first queen in all but title for many a year to come the keys to the kingdoms coffers shall be in your fleshy fists and not even kausalya will dare to question you on any account
1743060 you taunt and tease me manthara i already apologized for laying hands on you dont humiliate me now im a grown woman now not a girl anymore
1743061 my poor fat kaikeyi i am only telling you what is written in your kundalee dont you recall i have told you these very things before when i read your horoscope on your sixteenth naming day
1743062 you mean all the things you say they will really come to pass
1743063 every word of it you do wish it to come to pass dont you my little girl whelp
1743064 then come to me and let me tell you how you can help bring about the passing of these things
1743065 do not reveal yourselves rajkumars there are enemy eyes everywhere and it would be best if our mission goes unreported act the part of my acolytes and leave the talking to me
1743066 are you lost the way to ayodhya lies behind you
1743067 and greetings to you on this feast day regretfully my holy business takes me in the opposite direction of the holi mela at our great capital city my young apprentices were quite sullen about not being permitted to partake of maharaja dasarathas munificent hospitality i admit i too would not have been averse to enjoying the exotic sights and sounds of the celebration however i am bound for ananga ashrama on a holy errand and must reach it before nightfall
1743068 ananga ashrama this very day cant your business wait a day or three pundit our advice is return to the capital and take advantage of the maharajas hospitality for the duration of the seven day celebration nightfall is not long coming you will be safer within the walls of ayodhya come this way again next somvar and we will wish you good journey and let you pass without question
1743069 alas brave protectors my journey must be completed this day itself or my karya will be bhung what lies ahead that makes the way so perilous we are at peace yet with all our neighbors are we not
1743070 not for long if maharaja dasaratha stays as docile as he has been for so long
1743071 my fellow rakshak means no disrespect to our great maharaja punditji this has been a strange day with many strange rumors abroad talk of strange happenings across the kingdom we who watch and protect mithila bridge meet travelers from all parts of the land and hear much that ayodhya itself may not hear at all or hear days later
1743072 what scares you so that you seek to bar the raj marg to righteous pilgrims
1743073 scared youd do well not to use that word when speaking of rakshaks holy man nothing scares a rakshak
1743074 as i said there are strange rumors abroad it is difficult to know how much is truth and how much idle speculation or malicious gossip we who guard the ways hear much but know little for certain
1743075 we had news of a team of rakshasas breaking into the royal palace and ravishing two queens and killing several dozen palace guards before being cut down by a volley of thunderbolts flung by the mighty seer mage vishwamitra resurrected by the mantras of guru vashishta
1743076 and another rumor spoke of an army of asuras amassing in the southwoods at the behest of the lord of lanka at the height of the feasting and celebration when the army and pfs are all heady with wine and the gate watch is least manned accomplices of the asuras within the walls will open the gates and let them into the city to pillage and run amok
1743077 even if this gossipy chatter has a smidgen of truth my good man and mind you i do not grant it even that much license even if did though what does it have to do with us why bar the road to ananga ashrama surely the asuras do not seek to waylay simple men of god such as us
1743078 what would they hope to gain after all vishnus blessings
1743079 theres been word of asuras who alter their bhes bhav and appear as common travelers or even as nobility and royalty to deceive us protectors they say three rakshak wardens have been murdered in the woods by such deceivers
1743080 id give my right arm to get one chance just one to put my lance through one of them khottey sikkey ill show them how we deal with asuras here in kosala
1743081 and you may get your chance sooner than you think young man but now let us pass and go about our holy business the great lord siva will not be pleased if we do not reach ananga ashrama in time to complete our ishta
1743082 i wish i could be of help old one but our order has decided that until we receive orders directly from a kings envoy we are not to permit anyone to pass over mithila bridge
1743083 carry out your ishta on another auspicious day now return to ayodhya there will be a curfew outside the city and throughout the kingdom and all travelers without authorization scrolls will be dealt with on the spot these are our orders
1743084 i knew there was something not right with this lot
1743085 those things the brahmarishi shot at acted as some kind of tranquilizer
1743086 all i see are those goofy grins on their faces
1743087 thank you for your concern and for sharing your news good rakshaks lord siva strengthen your arm and protect you from harm
1743088 amazing bhai if we knew that trick we could get into any place we wanted
1743089 you need to get married soon brother before you become a father
1743090 and you need to get married before you become a monk
1743091 you mean youll marry sita when she comes of age dont deny it bhai youve always had a soft spot for maharaja janaks eldest
1743092 thrice removed manus lawbook says anything beyond first cousin is marriageable material so shes fair game and ripe for the hunting from what i hear
1743093 youre probably thinking of her younger sisters urmila was it the one with whom you were caught swimming nanga in the fountain
1743094 she talked me into it besides we were just babes barely weaned
1743095 so when we meet her next youll be sure to tell her that youve been fully weaned now right
1743096 all right you got me i always did like urmi why deny it in fact i cant count the number of times ive heard susama daiimaaa and my mother talk about making a match with four daughters and the four of us always when shatrugan or i was within hearing distance
1743097 rajkumars rama and lakshmana on the south bank of the sarayu the very hills and trees have ears we are in hostile territory now your innocent banter may be heard by spies of the lord of lanka keep your tongues in check unless something important needs saying
1743098 impossible as it may seem to you now i was young once too but keep your chatter for some more suitable time now you need to conserve your energy we still have a fair way to ananga ashrama and the daylight fades swiftly
1743099 soon i will run my course like all rivers must and i will sleep in the breast of the ocean and dream no more nightmares
1743100 rama will return safe he has the power of right on his side
1743101 why did you leave so suddenly i called after you but you rode as if you were in a chariot race i had to borrow mantri jabalis two horse to chase you here he looked sour faced as usual and suspicious and the greek envoy goggled as if suspecting some royal intrigue
1743102 good well give the court something more interesting to talk about than asura intrusions come to me my speedy one
1743103 the vaids would like me in my bed all day and night would you rather have that
1743104 even after i sent your son into the southwoods to fight rakshasas
1743105 you had no choice dasa the sage demanded his guru dakshina the peoples choice was unanimous you could only say aye never nay besides if rama is to be king he must learn to fulfill his dharma without question
1743106 it was not he who protested i was the one who could not bear to fulfill the sages demand even in the sabha hall i had rejected the seers demand and rama all but dropped to his knees and pledged his sword then and there
1743107 it was a blessed day that made me the father of that boy
1743108 and when he left with the sage so calmly and proudly kausalya i tell you truly at that moment i was never so proud to be his father nor so wretched at being a king
1743109 he will enhance your pride and make you forget your wretchedness
1743110 you have grown so much kausalya my god you were always strong as burnished bronze but now you are forged and tempered steel
1743111 steel that has been hammered beaten folded upon itself countless times and dipped into the icy heart of a glacier
1743112 tempered yes forged yes but never beaten i have wronged you my queen but you have grown stronger as a result and in your strength i sec ramas strength my kingdom will rest in able hands crowning him will be the best thing i have ever done as a maharaja
1743113 you judge yourself too harshly you are a man as well as a maharaja men make mistakes
1743114 you believe that my sending rama and lakshman to the southwoods was not one such mistake
1743115 why do you seek new ways to torture yourself dasaratha you did what you had to he will do what he must
1743116 well said but hard words i feel as if i have sent my son to his death
1743117 ashubh rama will return and he will be crowned the stars foretell it it was in his kundalee at birth you must remember that
1743118 his kundalee also predicted that he would be crowned king when he is thirty years of age yet i propose to crown him heir in the next fourteen days not fourteen years
1743119 being crowned prince heir is not being crowned king you will rule yet for another fourteen years if not twice as long that was what was meant in our sons kundalee
1743120 if a dutiful wifes karma could be joined to an undutiful husbands karma then perhaps it would be so but i think you ask the devas for too much kausalya
1743121 you speak truly there are reparations to be made you have suffered greatly
1743122 not reparations the devas owe us nothing this is all a vast game played by samay the wheel of time but this i believe rama will return from the southwoods safe and triumphant his reputation established and his prestige enhanced and in due course he will ascend the sunwood throne and join the illustrious ranks of the great suryavansha monarchs
1743123 my queen you speak with a golden tongue the devas grant your every wish
1743124 the deceitful husband and his harlot caught together at last by the betrayed wife someone run and fetch the royal kalakaar quick this will make a portrait worth hanging on my bedchamber wall or perhaps my bath chamber wall
1743125 sixteen elephants battle armored and shielded with eight horseback warriors and one chariot apiece
1743126 string your dhanush baans and keep your aim steady rajkumars
1743127 but these are ayodhyans approaching surely they cannot mean us any harm gurudev
1743128 from the time you left ayodhya you are no longer merely ayodhyans you are pilgrims on a holy mission anyone and anything that stands in our path must be treated as a potential enemy
1743129 i am sure this issue can be resolved with a few words but even so it is required that we support our own words with strong actions i ask you once again string your bows and do not hesitate to unleash them if these approaching kshatriyas should happen to disregard my requests do not forget you are now oath sworn to me and i command this action whatever happens from this point on you yourselves shall be blameless i take full responsibility for all consequences
1743130 a vajra bowmans hands are for holding his bow or his bride not for clutching the sides of a chariot like a milksop toddler
1743131 come no farther captain or my arrow flies to your breast
1743132 you would put metal in my breast this same breast on which you played as a babe bouncing on my knee tugging at my beard until my eyes watered come now rajkumar rama chandra you would no sooner shoot me than i would raise a sword to your bare neck put that shortbow away and let me have words with the sage
1743133 i have no business with you kshatriya return to ayodhya and let us proceed on our journey we have much ground yet to cover and the sun waits for no man
1743134 i do not ride out for my health mahadev my lieges orders bring me here maharaja dasaratha himself ordered me to follow after rajkumars rama chandra and lakshmana and join with them in their mission
1743135 he sends his very own vajra to assist them in their fight against the asura intruders
1743136 nevertheless we do not require your services turn your chariot around and go back the way you came we have no time to stand here and waste breath
1743137 rajkumar make the sadhu understand that i have direct orders from your father i cannot disobey the maharajas command and return without my duty discharged
1743138 captain bejoo my sword and my brothers sword are oath sworn to brahmarishi vishwamitra now i urge you to do as he suggests i am sure my father would understand your position
1743139 your father the maharajas orders were explicit and left no room for interpretation to return with my mission unfulfilled would be to openly disobey maharaj dasaratha i cannot do such a thing
1743140 and i will not permit you to accompany us heed your young princes wise words kshatriya return to ayodhya do not delay us further
1743141 oath sworn you may be rajkumar yet you are prince to the sunwood throne your father named you liege heir today to be crowned on your sixteenth name day this very month your first duty is to the seat and people of ayodhya and the kingdom of kosala you must understand why the maharaja sent me to accompany you two young boys princes can hardly face wild asuras in the bhayanak van alone you need our support to accomplish this perilous mission
1743142 i understand my fathers reasons for sending you captain but my oath leaves no room for interpretation either the brahmarishi has rejected your request and asked you to let us be pray heed his word and mine as well return to ayodhya
1743143 come rajkumars we have some way yet to travel before sunset and the way ahead is not as easy as the raj marg let us make haste
1743144 tell gaja to keep his bigfoots here for another hour then follow slowly and silently and i mean slow and silent samjhe not crashing through the forest like a pack of timber elephants
1743145 captain if we are to ride back to ayodhya then why the need for stealth
1743146 bheriya its a relief your beautiful new bride didnt suck your brains out along with your seed
1743147 wait a few minutes then send three scouts on foot after the rajkumars and the brahmin when they have determined the route theyre taking one will return to show us the closest cart path fit to carry our wheel and horse through that cursed bunch of darkwood a second scout will return another hour later guiding us the rest of the way by then it will be nightfall and we shall camp within easy reach of their camp if possible we shall take up the pursuit at daybreak using the same system to follow them to their destination and fulfill our mission as commanded
1743148 assuming we find a suitable cart path even part of the way and assuming the rajkumars stay close enough to it to be followed which would be unlikely dont you think bejoo
1743149 whatever happens i will follow my orders we must stay close enough behind the crown prince when he encounters any threat
1743150 the rajkumars can handle wild beasts and the like ive seen them hunt and theyre both as good with their bows as any mithila bowman its the rakshasas im talking about young rajkumar rama chandra has no idea what it means to face such creatures
1743151 stubborn brahmins vishnu avatar parasurama had the right idea hewing down kshatriyas with his ax except he should have taken his blade to brahmin necks instead one good purge like that and wed all be better off
1743152 dont worry captain well be between them and any asura scum before those wretches can open their mouths to snarl
1743153 then shut your slavering jaws and see to my orders
1743154 i wasnt aiming for your father you idio my son i was aiming at his harlot
1743155 be careful how you use your tongue kausalya is my queen and deserves your respect
1743156 go on smash my face youve used it often enough to know where best to strike
1743157 you are not in your senses apologize to kausalya and leave my presence at once
1743158 why so you can continue conspiring against my son and me in secret
1743159 dont think i dont know what that chudail is doing from the moment i heard that she had lured you into her chambers i knew that she was casting her spells again by what black art did she seduce you into depriving my son of his birthright raje or did she achieve her ends by the use of her vile womanly wiles
1743160 although i fail to see what you could find attractive in that bag of bones any one of your concubines would serve you better in the bedchamber
1743161 youre confusing your own methods with mine kaikeyi you were the one who lured my husband away from my marital bed into your illicit arms or have you forgotten that second queen
1743162 you witch dont deny you used sorcery to corrupt the maharajas mind he would never have consented to deny my bharat his kingship otherwise it was all your doing
1743163 you have overstepped your bounds i command you to apologize to kausalya at once
1743164 you go too far now woman remember your place behave like a queen of ayodhya
1743165 a queen mother am i funny after the announcement earlier today i thought i must be just another untitled concubine why else would you pass my son over for that witchs whelp and make me feel like a cast aside mistress
1743166 rama is my eldest son and the rightful heir to the throne you know that as well as bharat does ask your son if he begrudges his brother his birthright go on ask him
1743167 dont drag him into this mess you brute this is between you and me you made a promise once now live up to your words or do i have to remind you what happened on the field of kaikeya when you lay unconscious and mortally injured your host smashed and fleeing before the might of ravanas asura hordes does your precious first queen know about that day about how i swooped down into the heart of the battle in my chariot picked you up in my own arms and carried you to safety then returned and led my fathers forces as well as yours in a regroup that held the asura hordes back long enough to give you time to recover and lead your army once more have you forgotten that day dasaratha
1743168 then tell kausalya what you promised me when we returned to my fathers palace
1743169 leave me now bharat my son escort your mother to her chambers she needs to recover her wits
1743170 dont lay a hand on me you may be fooled by your fathers deceit but i wont let him get away with this the only thing i need to recover is your birthright and i promise you son ill get it back even if it takes me until my last breath
1743171 hear my words first witch even if your precious whelp returns alive from his trip to the southwoods which i honestly doubt he will not be crowned prince heir of ayodhya not on his name day or on any other day in his entire lifetime this is my curse as a wronged mother and betrayed wife hear my shraap and tremble
1743172 mahadev aapka lakh lakh shukar hai aapne meri jaan bachaii
1743173 there are far greater dangers in store for us than the natural pitfalls of geography rajkumar you would do well to remember that next time i may not be at hand to protect you from your own clumsiness
1743174 we have to reach the river before sunset you must perform your sandhyavandana
1743175 what is the name and source of this stream mahadev
1743176 a diversion of the sarayu rajkumar lakshman i diverted it myself some six hundred years past in order to provide sustenance for the rishis who inhabit this grove
1743177 you are sullied by your journey cleanse yourselves in the purifying waters of sarayu and perform your sandhyavandana with complete sincerity after that i will convey to you the twin maha mantras of bala and atibala come waste no more time your ancestor surya grows impatient to leave this part of the land and visit his dominions on the far side of prithvi
1743178 the maha mantras i am about to impart to you are the mothers of all martial knowledge when you have received them you will feel neither hunger nor thirst heat nor cold weariness nor drowsiness pain nor discomfort you will no longer fear any foe neither the nameless ancient spirits that walk abroad in the ungodly hours before dawn nor the hideous asuras that will seek your destruction in the days to come as long as you respect and use these gifts wisely and sparingly neither disease nor age will touch you no enemy can attack you unawares when you are asleep or off guard no bodily urges will overcome your wits or allow you to be seduced even the most ravishing apsaras of indras court and the most sensuous gandharvas of the forest will not succeed in arousing your desires the strength of your limbs will be unmatched on this earth and none other in the three worlds will equal your vidya your shakti and your chaturta you will have no equal on or off the field of battle accept the gift of these great scientific formulae master the use of them deploy them wisely and sparingly and you will be warriors among warriors kshatriyas from whom other kshatriyas may learn gurus to your varna
1743179 no idea but dont speak kalis name in these dark places brother you never know she might hear and come searching to see who uses her name in vain
1743180 and what will he tell him that theres no cart path through the thicket and even if there were how would our horse and wheel go down this slope or for that matter how will we
1743181 twas still light then in a few minutes it will be as dark as your mothers womb how are we to do it then
1743182 we wait until dawn then ananga ashrama is across the stream in kamas grove the seer and the rajkumars must mean to camp the night there we wait here until dawn at first light we go down
1743183 you take first watch while i get some shut eye
1743184 it is after sundown rajkumar lakshman i prefer not to immerse myself in running water after suryas last kiran leaves prithvi
1743185 you are wondering how your brother has suddenly gained the strength of a bull elephant rajkumar lakshman
1743186 this is the result of the maha mantras bala and atibala already they have begun to transform your physiognomy altering the very cellular structure of your bodies enhancing your abilities and empowering you in numerous immeasurable ways this little display of raw strength was only a small taste of the full effect of the maha mantras soon you two will be able to do much more than simply pick up and toss dead trees
1743187 of course young lakshman the maha mantras act differently on different individuals it is true they may enhance some aspects of ramas mind and body while altering other aspects in your own makeup but alter they will beyond the shadow of a doubt already you can see the effect of their miraculous empowerment look at your brother and at yourself look closely
1743188 after the maha mantras have fully empowered both of you i may induct you in the use of dev astras the divine weapons of the devas themselves imbibing bala and atibala is an essential foundation before taking that step
1743189 come now rajkumars it grows dark let us make our way to ananga ashrama
1743190 perhaps you might like to take care of the chore rajkumar lakshman
1743191 mahadev you honor our humble hermitage a thousandfold with your presence we welcome you and your noble companions to ananga ashrama blessed are all who enter here
1743192 well met again rishi adhranga i accept your generous invitation on behalf of my companions and myself
1743193 forgive me yet again wise one i have learned the error of my ways
1743194 it smells like like a woman just passed through here guruji
1743195 not a woman young brahmachari more like a basket of flowers
1743196 it was in the northeast corner with the agarbattis dumma must have brought it in
1743197 just because i brought in a queens blessing once doesnt mean im always bringing flowers
1743198 but no harm done we of the order of siva usually eschew luxuries of any kind including scent giving blossoms but we must consider this unexpected offering an auspicious greeting for our honored guests
1743199 yesterday my young companions slept on beds of satin and silk tonight they sleep on darbha grass mats
1743200 that is the only shiksha we teach our brahmacharyas the first five years how to do without in order to grow within
1743201 rajkumar rama do you have a thought youd like to share with us
1743202 mahadev my brothers and i were weaned on such terrifying stories of the southwoods the so called bhayanak van the forbidden forest the desolate place lair of demons and darkness
1743203 this grove is on the periphery of that same dread southwoods within reach of its evil influence yet the rishis of this ashram dont seem troubled by rakshasas or other asuras here they live outside the protection of ayodhya and the rakshak rangers beyond the boundaries of the arya nations unmolested and unharmed i dont understand it for hundreds of generations our people have believed these southwoods inhospitable and uninhabitable we have traveled as far north as the norselands and the frozen wastelands of siber unchecked yet our supremacy has never been able to extend south of the sarayu and yet here we are in this beautiful glade that is as tranquil and fragrant as any flower grove of ayodhya an idyllic grove a heavenly grove apparently safe and free of all evil influence it flies in the face of everything known about the southwoods how is this possible
1743204 well asked rajkumar a puzzling conundrum that deserves a satisfying reply and you shall have it rishi adhranga i believe you would be the best one to respond to rajkumar rama chandras question please would you grace us with your knowledge
1743205 it would honor me to share my vidya with these proud princes of ayodhya mahadev i am fortunate that you deem me worthy
1743206 i will not give you false hope your fathers condition is precarious
1743207 i appreciate your knowledge but there are some conditions that are beyond the scope of ayurveda even the great body of arya medical science has limits when issues of life and death are concerned
1743208 that is what i was trying to avoid saying but yes it is true he may last a week a month or even more than one month but i am afraid his time is coming
1743209 there must be something you can do guru vashishta can do something he has lived seven thousand years he must know how to prolong fathers life
1743210 i cant speak for the mahaguru all i can tell you is that our medical knowledge has exhausted itself now whatever happens it is out of our hands aagya rajkumars
1743211 what good are they then if they cant help him at a time like this what good is all that knowledge and learning
1743212 shatrugan calm down this is not a mace fight you wont help father by getting angry
1743213 i know youre right bhai but i cant seem to make myself understand it
1743214 its as if something inside me refuses to accept that father is mortal
1743215 when faced with something as omnipotent as mortality our first reaction is fear and in a healthy being fear always manifests itself first as anger you are right to feel angry but you must learn not to vent that anger instead channel it into a more useful emotion turn it into prayer
1743216 forgive my asking gurudev but will prayer truly help father now if i pray long and hard enough will yamaraj lord of death spare his life for another twenty years or forty
1743217 i will permit your lapse this time young shatrugan because i empathize with the turmoil you are experiencing but never again question so fundamental a practice as prayer if every arya swayed by a momentary personal crisis lost sight of his faith this entire nation and all the arya nations with it would be condemned to eternal damnation you consider yourself strong do you shatrugan then prove your strength of spirit as well as body mann as well as tann keep control of your emotions and your tongue you cannot put out a fire by adding the oil of your own anger into the flames
1743218 you asked about prayer young shatrugan about how it can help your father i did not propose you pray for his recovery his condition is beyond reprieve whatever is happening to him now is his own karma manifesting itself nay i asked you to pray for your own sake
1743219 yes prayer cleanses the soul at a time of crisis and prepares us to meet and face any challenge turn your harmful negative energy into the positive power of prarthana pray not for your father rajkumar pray that you may accept the inevitability of his passing with grace and fortitude
1743220 you go ahead bhai i i need some time to come to terms with this before i visit father
1743221 i think ill take gurujis advice ill be at the mandir praying if you need me
1743222 he fears the dark his vision is dimming and he wants it to be as bright as possible
1743223 i heard her calling out to father shouting at the servants i had seen him go up to the tower minutes before he does that sometimes i know when he needs to be alone i told her he was up there only after she ran up the stairs i realized she was carrying the spear i followed her thinking she might not be in her full senses
1743224 i didnt know she would go so far say such awful things
1743225 i cant believe she threatened father and you with violence
1743226 we cannot control the actions of others bharat each of us makes our own choices creates our own karma you are not responsible for your mothers actions dont carry her burden of guilt on your shoulders
1743227 be strong bharat your father needs you kosala needs you all will be well as long as you remember who you are and what your dharma is the rest is beyond any mortals grasp free your mind of all guilt or regret you have done nothing but honor your father and your line your father and i have nothing but pride and love for you putra
1743228 ananga ashrama is the last peaceful place you will find on your southward journey rajkumar
1743229 but it is not my business to speak of those matters by sivas grace you are in the hands of the venerable brahmarishi vishwamitra he is your guru now and you should count yourself blessed that after being raised on the infinite wisdom of guru vashishta one of the oldest and most venerated of the seven seers you are now being tutored by yet another of the same septet the youngest and most powerful seer in this age vishwamitra himself may his infinite wisdom guide you well on your perilous journey for none have gone the way you go and returned this way alive before
1743230 excuse my lack of manners we of ananga ashrama are unaccustomed to the social niceties befitting such honorable company you asked me how is it possible that this grove remains so idyllic and tranquil even though it borders on the dread bhayanak van or to use the modern name it goes by southwoods to know this you must first know the history of ananga ashrama and the grove in which it stands by your grace i will tell this tale it is a short tale
1743231 and one you might perhaps have heard in brief from your guru vashishta for this grove is more widely known as kama ashrama and the tale is often told as the tale of kamas folly
1743232 but kamas folly is the place where siva destroyed lord kama thats a myth
1743233 indeed rajkumar lakshman over time truth becomes fact fact is rewritten as history history fades to legend and eventually legend remains as myth yet you are blessed for you live in the treta yuga the age of reason not as blessed as the satya yuga or age of truth but close enough that you may still tread the same sites where devas once lived and loved and fought and those tales you call myths were once living events as real as your own actions over time even these tales will fade from memory and by the coming of the kali yuga or age of darkness they will be mere race memories dismissed as mere mythology or fantasy by those who believe themselves rational and scientific yet to us who live here and now these are scientific and rational tales for they obey the scientific rules of our world without exception all you need is a proper knowledge of our science or as we aryas name it vidya
1743234 but i digress once again forgive these little digressions of mine we rishis of the order of siva have vowed our lives to the worship and contemplation of the destroyer katha vidya or the science of tale telling is an important and precious part of our calling you might even say it is our only wealth and if stories are treasure why then we are rich men every one of us here are we not my good rishis
1743235 to return to my katha or tale then as i said this hermitage which we call ananga ashrama is one and the same as the mythic place you know as kama ashrama we call it ananga ashrama for a very good reason which you will know by the time the katha is told the katha dates back to the time after the creation when devas lived on prithvi back in the morning of the first day of brahma also known as the satya yuga or age of truth for all was innocent and uncorrupted then brahmacharyas do you know how long a day of brahma is
1743236 pranaam guruji each day of brahma consists of two billion one hundred sixty million of our solar years when brahma has created the world it remains unaltered for this entire period at the end of a single day of brahma the world and all it contains is consumed by fire only the brahmarishis devas and elements surviving brahma then sleeps for an unknown period of time when he awakens once more he again creates the world and a new day of brahma begins when he completes a hundred of his years in this manner brahmas own existence ends and he the universe the devas and sages and all else are dissolved into their constituent elements
1743237 well said young dumma but i only asked you for the duration of a single day of brahma the rest of your explanation was not called for it expended breath and energy that could have been better utilized in your invocation of siva rather than in a childish attempt to generate envy in the breasts of your fellow brahmacharyas
1743238 these events happened in the first part of the first day of brahma the devas lived their lives unburdened by the responsibilities of governing creation only a few mortals had been created and not all asuras had yet declared their hostility against the gods it was in this period that rudra whom we now speak of as lord siva a simple mendicant who took pleasure in meditating in cremation grounds and in passing his time in the company of spirits ghouls goblins and suchlike took into his heart a desire to wed the beautiful sati daughter of lord daksha seed spreader i use the term seed spreader or seed caster in the sense of prajapati or he who procreates his own kind not in the agricultural sense of one who literally flings seeds into furrowed soil for lord daksha was one of only a few chosen mortals who had evolved from their simian ancestors and had been given the task of multiplying the numbers of their race upon this prithvi like your own ancestor lord manu rajkumars who composed the laws by which civilized humans would govern themselves descended from the deva surya himself who was likewise a seed spreader of the ikshvaaku clan and one of the founders of the arya race
1743239 so young rudra for even lord siva was young once became greatly enamored with lord dakshas daughter sati and desired to wed her and beautiful and virtuous sati herself desired to become mate to the young mendicant rudra at first she was somewhat put off by rudras supernatural companions and wild antics in the netherworld but she was confident she would rid him of his bachelor habits once they were conjugally united
1743240 she would not be the first woman to believe that she could change our lord siva through the use of feminine devices
1743241 prajapati daksha did not share his daughter satis affection for the wild eyed young wanderer
1743242 so to slight his new son in law daksha staged a great yagna and deliberately neglected to invite rudra while making sure that sati herself was present sati soon realized what her father had done as all the assembled guests began commenting critically on rudras absence
1743243 but dakshas scheme flew back in his own face like an ill shot arrow returned by a powerful wind
1743244 lord daksha was stricken by the outcome of his actions but it was too late to undo what had been done news of satis sacrifice reached rudra at first the dark skinned deva was consumed by anger as fierce as the agni that had consumed his wife but he grew heartsick when he realized that he could not spill the blood of his beloved satis father unable to avenge her death and cleanse his grief through violence he vowed to retire from life itself since he was a deva and immortal he could not take his own life instead he sat beneath a banyan tree and began the epic meditations which we attempt to emulate even today in humble mortal form as the asanas of yoga
1743245 this same ancient tree beneath which we sit tonight as you can see its vines and limbs are matted in empathy with our lord sivas own matted hair reminding us of his great grief at the loss of his beloved
1743246 now as you all know when siva meditates the world could end and he would not be aware of it
1743247 our lord siva would have maintained his yogic trance until the sun itself grew red and weak and the planets crumbled away to dust
1743248 but one day an event came to pass in the material world that would result in his return to this physical plane of karma and rebirth a powerful yaksi named tataka had began to torment the inhabitants of a forest near the site where siva meditated
1743249 you said a powerful yaksi was tormenting people by yaksi i take it you mean a female yaksa guruji but the yaksa race is benign and friendly to mortals as well as to the devas
1743250 of course that is what we learned at our guruji vashishtas gurukul i dont actually know if yaksas really exist anymore my mother sumitra maa says they were only created to scare naughty young boys to sleep
1743251 what you say is not wholly incorrect rajkumar lakshmana once the yaksas like several other asura races were benign and even friendly to mortals and devas it was only a few tens of thousands of years ago that they became our bitter enemies but to tell the story of how that came to pass would take many nights
1743252 to answer your question briefly it was the dark lord of lanka himself who turned the yaksa race against mortals just as it was none other than ravana who was secretly responsible for tataka becoming the menace of her time but that is another katha in itself i am sure the esteemed brahmarishi will impart that katha to you at some appropriate time
1743253 to return to our katha this yaksi was a scourge on the face of prithvi her ravages had turned the entire region around her into a haunted and cursed forest literally bhayanak van what we now call southwoods
1743254 i beseech you go no further great evil is at work down in those dungeons
1743255 and our job is to root out evil and send it fleeing
1743256 the warden knows as much as i do i was only questioning them when when they changed
1743257 go home good jabali brew yourself some hot broth and cover yourself well you are suffering from shock we will deal with this matter tomorrow in the light of day we shall speak again
1743258 thank you gurudev i shall pray for your safe return
1743259 i have vacated the guards from this level after the first two were killed i did not deem it necessary to risk the lives of any more in any case the prisoners whatever that thing is it does not seem to seek to escape
1743260 my second man dragged himself as far as this point
1743261 thank you good warden you may leave us now and return to your post we shall proceed on our own now
1743262 as you please masters vishnu bless you for allowing me to save myself from entering that hellhole again
1743263 that will open the last door now when you come back
1743264 ill be waiting for you at the top of the stairwell
1743265 do you think you could help us if we get into trouble in there
1743266 we shall send for you if required go now good warden leave us
1743267 one moment are all the thirteen prisoners in there together
1743268 aye pradhan mantri but you may have difficulty counting them off
1743269 courage sumantra remember this before we go in the power of brahman is the essence of all supernatural and natural energy in the universe even those who seek to do evil deeds must use and pervert the same flow of brahman to serve their heinous ends therefore they can never be a match for us who serve the good side of brahman good will always triumph over evil in this war
1743270 now open the door and let us face whatever awaits us within this dungeon
1743271 tatakas ravages were so terrible the very land itself was blighted permanently by her forays
1743272 i will tell them the tale of tataka some other time rishi adhranga pray continue your tale of how ananga ashrama earned its name
1743273 shama mahadev i will try not to wander from my katha path again
1743274 as i was saying tatakas atrocities soon grew too terrible for the devas to ignore
1743275 but before anyone could take action the devas were besieged by hordes of asura armies led by the lord of lanka ravana himself after many wars and battles in which the asuras lost as much ground as they gained their disparate races had finally united under the banner of ravana and his ambition was as great as the asura host he led he sought to invade the very cities of the gods the shining cities of amravarti and vaikunta were both besieged and mighty indra leader of the armies of the devas was hard pressed to defend those mighty domains not a single deva could be spared to go down to the realm of prithvi and deal with the intolerable menace of tataka
1743276 yes young brahmacharya rudra also known as siva only siva himself possessed the power to face the fierce yaksi for he had tasted the poison of sagara and survived in doing so he alone of the devas had experienced the corruption of an atmaa the opposite of brahman that darkest of darknesses that exist in the absence of the light of aatma or the eternal soul siva could use his power of destruction to cleanse evil things preparing the way for their re creation by brahma he had only to open his third eye and tataka would exist no more in her present form
1743277 however as you will recall siva was deeply engrossed in his meditation and was determined to remain engrossed thus for the duration of all the remaining days of brahma until the end of existence itself such was his self discipline so it was decided by the devas that an emissary be sent to awaken him from his meditation sage narada declined the mission for reasons unknown the devas then sent the beauteous parvati an incarnation of sati herself sivas lost wife parvati had chosen to be reborn once again in order to reconsummate her relationship with her beloved mate this time she made sure she picked a father and mother who would honor her husband unlike the wretched daksha whose name was forever linked with his shameful misdeed sati in her new avatar as parvati waited patiently for many thousands of our years in the grove where her lord sat meditating gathering his favorite flowers and dressing her hair with their scented blossoms and doing all she could to rouse him from his yogic trance but even her sensual presence could not interrupt his sambhavimudra so the devas resolved to send the god of desire kama to help rouse siva
1743278 young dumma you learned of kama only this morning did you not can you tell us what human quality kama is the god of
1743279 kama is desire for good in any form be it love procreation or simply goodness on earth in all forms
1743280 well spoken and yet being the lord of sexual desire as well as all other desires kama was prone to some mischievous ways when he saw parvati clad so sensuously in anticipation of her husbands amorous reawakening he thought he could sling down two patridges with one throw he would rouse siva by instilling in him sexual desire for parvati thus reuniting the lost lovers as well as fulfilling his mission with this end in mind kama danced and frolicked in the grove around the tree beneath which siva sat
1743281 when kamas first frolics went unnoticed by siva the god of desire grew bolder he strung his bow made of a sugarcane stalk and a living cord of honeybees dipped an arrow into the heart of a red rose and loosed it at sivas heart pierced by the benign missile siva awoke at last but stirred as he was from deep meditation on his lost mate he was angered to find the god of desire attempting to conjugate what he thought was a new mating for him had siva only taken an instant to look closely at parvati he would have seen that kama was only trying to reunite him with his own sweet sati but siva is not known for his patience he opened his third eye and blasted lord kama into ashes bhasam kar diya kamadev ko
1743282 kama was left bodiless an anga he who has no physical body from which word our hermitage is named ananga ashrama then the wife of kama ran to brahma tearing her hair beating her breast and moaning inconsolably over the loss of her husband brahma creator of all creatures great and small promised rati that when siva and parvati were married kama would be restored to his body now the task of rousing siva fell to parvati who had to do so not only in order to regain her lost mate but also to restore kama and thirdly to defeat the yaksi tataka more determined than ever to succeed parvati began a severe penance abiding by the laws laid down by siva himself the father of austerity these ten laws of course are the cornerstone of our life here at ananga ashrama
1743283 after millennia of self inflicted austerity the lovely parvati had lost much of her beauty her spirit was as lean and withered as her body in the wake of such great tapasya yet still she toiled on in her attempt to rouse her beloved and still siva failed to heed her prayers
1743284 finally when it seemed that parvati must surely waste away to nothingness a handsome young ascetic came to her and asked her why she inflicted such suffering on herself when she told him the object of her penance he laughed in disbelief and wondered if the strange and terrifying siva deserved the love of a woman as beautiful as herself the young ascetic then sought to arouse her desire for himself promising to be a better husband to her than siva could ever be parvati was shocked to find herself responding to his caresses as she experienced an overpowering attraction to the handsome stranger disgusted at her own disloyalty she resolved to take her own life once more rather than succumb to his advances but just as she was about to reprise the self immolation of her earlier avatar sati the ascetic revealed himself to be none other than siva awoken at long last and only seeking to tease parvati as she had teased and taunted him with her sexuality for so long in kamas grove the two of them then danced the tandav the great and terrible dance of procreation awakening the entire universe with their tantric sexuality and at the moment of their joining by using the formidable energies unleashed by their union lord brahma was able to restore kama to his body
1743285 siva and parvati were lost for eons in lovemaking on the peak of mount kailasa where they made their home eventually the devas began despairing of what they had done for it seemed that siva would never leave parvatis arms long enough to slay tataka but parvati was mindful of their need and bore siva a young son kartikeya it was kartikeya who went forth to put an end to the scourge of tataka later as we all know siva and parvatis blessed union would yield another equally illustrious son the mighty ganesha he who had his head lopped off by his own father and had to make do with the head of a baby elephant
1743286 thank you rishi adhranga you honor us with your katha vidya seldom have i heard the tale of kamas folly told with such simple precision and accuracy truly we are most pleased and honored to have received the fruits of your katha vidya
1743287 we shall require a raft to sail downriver i am aware of the skill of your ashram in making balsa wood rafts perhaps your brahmacharyas could show my young companions how to make one tonight we leave at daybreak
1743288 my brahmacharyas will be happy to make such a vessel for your use of course the young shishyas are welcome to watch and learn we keep a supply of ready cut balsa logs for expressly this purpose and we are accustomed to lashing rafts together in an hour or two my boys are quite happy to put one together simply for the distraction it provides from their usual chores i will see to it
1743289 we are indebted to you for your grace and hospitality rishiji
1743290 the katha you narrated so eloquently was mainly about siva and his epic meditation on the loss of his consort kamadev hardly plays much part in the whole story then why is this spot named after kama
1743291 its just that every time the katha of kamas grove is narrated the listener always asks this very same question who will answer this time
1743292 tonight seems to be your night to speak young dumma very well perform this last service to our guests
1743293 the story is not just about lord siva and devi parvati but about their great love for one another a love that neither samay nor karma could tear asunder it was for this reason that the devas sent kama god of love to try to awaken siva from his deep meditation hence this spot is named not just in honor of the god of love but for the epic love of siva and parvati kamas folly kamas grove this is the most sacred lovers rendezvous in all the three worlds
1743294 and good sirs someday when you find your own lifes true love then you would be well advised to visit this grove with your beloved and seal your bond in this most romantic of spots
1743295 how many times have i told you dumma that is not part of our katha vidya you are not to repeat that last part ever again am i understood
1743296 but guruji they said you had changed your mind and i should make sure to tell our esteemed guests about this romantic side of our sacred shrine
1743297 perhaps i mistook their words guruji im sorry it wont happen again
1743298 what are you all staring at then go on and start fetching the material for the raft you heard the brahmarishi that raft has to be ready before daybreak get to work then saivites om namah siva
1743299 i have told him several times before that it would not be in our best interest to spread that legend once again
1743300 until recently perhaps just a hundred or so years ago this place had become a notorious lovers rendezvous it was believed you see that couples who urn consummated their relationships in this sacred grove would experience a bonding as eternal as the love of siva and parvati
1743301 it made things quite awkward for our order as you can well imagine
1743302 we can imagine how awkward it must have been very very awkward no doubt
1743303 couples sneaking through the grove all night indulging in grossly inappropriate behavior often while we were busy with our katha vidya and it would distract some of our younger brahmacharyas while engrossed in their celibate studies its hard maintaining celibacy when half the kingdoms love besotted couples are rolling about and squealing all around you
1743304 but perhaps my companions could join your brahmacharyas and assist in preparing the vessel for our journey and as we have to leave early i have a few spiritual obligations of my own to perform before this night of holi purnima passes
1743305 shambhu our guests wish to observe how we make our rafts take them and treat them with respect brahmarishi if you will follow me i will escort you to the mandir we maintain on the north wall of the ashram that would be the most appropriate place for you to offer your prayers
1743306 was the brahmarishi suppressing his laughter or was that just my imagination
1743307 i think he was straining to hold back the loudest guffaw ever heard in the seven nations
1743308 be welcome rajkumars of ayodhya we are honored by your presence
1743309 i thought saivites renounced all worldly titles and hierarchies when they took their oaths
1743310 that is so rajkumar kintu how can we ignore your royal stature
1743311 go on feel my arm squeeze it bend it pinch it if you like
1743312 you see then i am flesh and blood same as you are a boy same as you are mortal same as you all treat me as any other mortal flesh and blood boy then please not as a prince or a lord or a deva just a boy is that understood
1743313 the next one to call me rajkumar or lord gets a whack on the back of the head samjhe
1743314 now sit down and show us how you make your famous rafts
1743315 but i thought you brother dumma were the expert on naughty stories rather than making rafts that was quite a shock you gave your guru back there i think hes still recovering from the surprise
1743316 if you like i can tell you some more naughty stories about kamas grove and the things that happened in there
1743317 dummas stories will turn your ears red with embarrassment dont be fooled by his cherubic looks hes a rascal of the first order when it comes to jokes and pranks
1743318 well i think my brother and i wouldnt mind our ears turning a wee bit red not purple mind you but just a little pink maybe a bit darker too
1743319 steady pradhan mantri keep your mind free of negative thoughts here take my hand
1743320 keys will not work on that door now sumantra the force that bolted it shut wishes us to remain here until its work is done
1743321 even asuras must obey the laws of nature such misuse of the power of brahman will not go unchecked by the devas ravana your excesses go beyond endurance
1743322 do your worst rakshasa you will not triumph this transgression marks the beginning of your end you hasten your own downfall with every evil act you perpetrate
1743323 speak no more to me ravana i have no wish to hear your ill thought boasts and see your cheap antics begone from this place begone before i cast you back into that furnace of agony where you truly belong back into patal that lowest level of narak and this time even a thousand years of penance will not get you brahmas attention nor sivas the devas are wise to your ways now begone before i send you fleeing like a pariah dog
1743324 your threats do not scare me rakshasa already your assassin has been exposed and dispatched your spies have been unrooted and soon we shall strike a mortal blow at the heart of your forces your grandiose dreams are merely that dreams your cloven feet shall never step on the proud avenues of ayodhya
1743325 just a shishya who enjoys a good joke as much as you do always remember that respect all men but worship none adoration is for the devas
1743326 he has eyes in the back of his head i told you a prince of ayodhya has powers
1743327 to want what you have not that is the eternal longing of the mortal heart
1743328 staying with saivites has made you suddenly pious i hope you wont try to shoot down the rakshasas with mantras instead of arrows
1743329 actually i thought i might try tossing tree trunks at them
1743330 speaking of that ive been wanting to ask you since last night have you felt anything else anything different
1743331 not really just better stronger healthier but i thought it was because we had such a good time with the brahmacharyas last night
1743332 it was fun wasnt it wish we could stay a week or two we never did get to celebrate holi after all
1743333 well maybe after we finish off the rakshasas and the brahmarishi completes his yagna we can make a detour and stop by at mithila
1743334 so you can smear a little holi rang on your urmilas pretty face
1743335 you dont have to be so touchy about her little brother ill ask brahmarishi to speak to her father about your match if you like janak chacha will be glad to have you as his son in law im sure
1743336 not as much as youve fallen for her sister sita
1743337 if you have finished your tomfoolery rajkumars we might consider departing we have other things to do besides pushing one another around in muddy riverbanks if you recall
1743338 rajkumar rama rajkumar lakshman i have fruits here for you to nourish you on your journey
1743339 you are a wise brahmacharya dumma warriors must eat to gain strength toss them across one at a time and mind that you do not fall into the river
1743340 visit us again on your way back lord rama ill keep more fruit ready for you sitaphals
1743341 theyre known as kare kare west of the indus tunhi up north and in desh burmuch but father and guru vashishta always call them chini kulang because they fly south to our land every year from north chinn to escape the harsh winter snows
1743342 from the frozen tundraland of siber to be accurate much farther north of chinn there the russis name them white crane or siber crane mostly they seek out the warmer climes of marwar and gujjar but some grow weary of the long flight and settle here they will return home to their snowlands in a few days
1743343 of course it happened to be a jhillis mating call rather than the chini kulangs natural cry but im sure they didnt mind
1743344 yes right now those snow cranes are probably wondering since when did marsh crakes grow so tall and pole rafts downriver
1743345 it was all a dream rama and lakshman are still in the palace playing holi they never went to the bhayanak van they arent gone to fight asuras theyre right here safe and sound in their beds asleep
1743346 no my lord they have indeed gone to the southwoods to fight asuras they are under the protection of the brahmarishi vishwamitra and well armed and equipped they will return home soon safely
1743347 rama is the best bowman in the kingdom hes better than even shatrugan and i hell come back safely i know he will
1743348 putra your father needs to be alone for some time why dont you retire to your bedchamber and take some rest you can come see him first thing in the morning
1743349 i will stay with him a little while longer to tend to his needs
1743350 dasa what is it what was the dream you just had why did it trouble you so
1743351 tell me about it it will make it easier to forget tell me your dream
1743352 before i met you when i was young and strong and brainless i loved to hunt more than anything else in the world except maybe women
1743353 once i was deep in the forest hot on the trail of a nilgiri stag a big one i had been after it for the better part of a full day it was evening almost sundown i was tired and exasperated at not having downed it yet my companions were searching for me i could hear them calling faintly in the distance far away there was a princess i think a beauty i wanted to return with a trophy not empty handed
1743354 just when i thought i had lost it i heard a sound up ahead i went carefully through the bushes it was thick and close there the undergrowth tiger territory i was on edge my bow strung my arrow ready to be loosed if i so much as breathed on the string there was a waterhole up ahead i could smell the water and the odors of the animals that came to drink there many different animals i heard an animal drinking the wet slapping sounds like a large stags tongue might make when slurping up water thirstily
1743355 i judged its position behind a berry bush and loosed my arrow
1743356 i went down to the waterhole knowing i had hit it squarely i found him there his earthern pot fallen by his side shattered into two halves the arrow was in his throat a mortal wound he was clutching it gasping for breath for life life that i had stolen because i wanted a trophy for a princess
1743357 he tried to tell me something i tried to beg his forgiveness he pointed unable to speak gestured at the water at the broken pot i held him until he died he was a strong handsome young man in the prime of life like myself
1743358 after he had passed away i tried to understand what he had been trying to show me i went the way he had pointed i found a small path worn from use from his daily trips to the waterhole and back at the end of the path i found a tiny shack barely a cottage a hut inside the hut were an old couple weak and ailing both were blind
1743359 i told them what i had done i tried to explain that i was a rajkumar of ayodhya heir to the sunwood throne money was no object i would see to it that they were taken care of for the rest of their lives they cursed me
1743360 cursed they said that they had little time left to live the only thing that kept them alive was the knowledge that they had such a fine young son that he would go on after their passing away would take a wife someday would continue their line now with him gone they had nothing left to live for what good was my money they wanted their son back could i give them back their son
1743361 i left there in mortal fear their curse rang in my ears i found my hunting party returned to the hut intending to take the old couple back to the palace with me ask my father aja to decide what to do next
1743362 when i returned they were both dead they had taken their own lives by chewing on a poisonroot plant
1743363 not the end the curse that was what gave you that bad dream wasnt it what was the curse they laid upon you what was it dasa
1743364 they said that one day i too would lose a son the way they had lost their son
1743365 that it would happen when i was old and ailing like they were when i needed him most that he would be brutally murdered the way i murdered satyakaam not even knowing or seeing the face of his enemy
1743366 my dream was of rama in the bhayanak van he was alone separated from lakshman and the brahmarishi and that was when the asuras attacked him from behind from above from all around he was surrounded and torn apart by the beasts torn to shreds
1743367 no dasa that is not ramas fate rama will come back to us safe and sound alive
1743368 but if you are right then what of the curse of satyakaam what about my karma
1743369 everything you like and a little special something of my own
1743370 manthara you eating a paan whats the occasion there must be an occasion if youre eating paan
1743371 its been a very good day for us my queen a very good day indeed and an even more fruitful night
1743372 yes it went just as you said i did as you told me to do confronted dasaratha and kausalya and gave them both a piece of my mind and i told them what you said to say that bharat would be the next king of ayodhya not rama
1743373 you should have seen kausalyas face she thought i was going to spear her
1743374 you must not use direct violence against anyone you saw how much more effective it was to use emotional violence against the maharaja it brought him to his knees more effectively than even a spear throw and this way nobody can blame you for what was after all just a family squabble you were only venting your natural inevitable reaction to your son being passed over for the coronation
1743375 if he dies then his successor will become maharaja at once and that successor will be bharat
1743376 dasa will live awhile yet long enough to change his decision
1743377 and long enough to see the bloody broken corpse of rama laid before his eyes
1743378 of course the bhayanak van the asuras will kill him thats what you mean isnt it
1743379 but what if he survives what if he returns home safe and claims the crown hell be a hero then the people will support him over bharat so will the court
1743380 the people and the court will support their maharaja and as i said before the maharaja will rescind his decision and declare bharat his successor less than two weeks from today
1743381 how can you be so sure i mean how can you guarantee that dasaratha will rescind and declare bharat
1743382 thats what i want to discuss with you my dear you remember the two vows dasaratha promised you back on the battlefied after the last asura war
1743383 youre a genius why didnt i ever think of that the two vows you think the time is right to claim them now
1743384 our presence has been sensed already soon she will get word of our arrival at first she will not deign to come herself believing her minions to be more than capable of dealing with us only when they fail will she take serious note even then we may have to go to her rather than wait for her to approach her power grows strongest at midnight and is weakest at noonday when the sun reaches its zenith that is the time you must attack and cleanse the earth of tataka forever
1743385 tataka parantu mahadev just last night rishi adhranga told us the story of how kartikeya killed her
1743386 the story he told was of the history of kamas grove rajkumar lakshman of how kamadev and parvati devi interrupted lord sivas grief stricken meditation to tempt him into creating a son who would be able to destroy the evil yaksi that son was kartikeya and he was indeed created to kill tataka which duty he fulfilled to his great honor
1743387 tataka is dead killed by kartikeya but as you know matter can never truly be destroyed only transformed so when she died she only left this mortal plane and was sent to the next plane where she now belongs where would that be rajkumar rama
1743388 narak the third and lowest of the three worlds otherwise called hell
1743389 but mahadev we are still on prithvi are we not how can hell be here
1743390 this is very much our own world the mortal plane of prithvi
1743391 this is the sorcerous power of ravana king of the asuras young lakshman listen
1743392 after he was banished by the devas to patal the lowest level of hell ravana the terrible spent many thousands of years performing bhor tapasya so austere and awful to contemplate that even the devas were compelled to grant him many boons
1743393 but ravana misused his shakti performing terrible barbaric sacrificial yagnas to achieve evil ends one result of his efforts was the tearing of a hole between the realms of prithvi and patal this was the very reason why he chose to build his capital the black fortress over the then submerged island of lanka lanka was in fact not a piece of dry land at all but a giant extinct volcano used by the devas to plug the entrance to patal deep beneath the great ocean ravanas sorcery raised the island resurrecting the volcano with whose molten lava he built his impregnable fortress creating a passageway through the heart of the volcano into patal through this he raises a constant stream of asuras recruiting them directly from hell itself to create the largest asura host ever assembled
1743394 as long as that portal remains open ravana has access to unlimited hordes to fling at the arya nations
1743395 but pardon my asking what does it have to do with tataka and this bhayanak van lanka is thousands of yojanas distant from here
1743396 or at least it should be by the normal laws of geography
1743397 what you say is true rajkumar lakshman but ravanas ill gotten brahman shakti has grown powerful enough to enable him to punch holes in the fabric that separates realms he has punched another such hole here releasing tataka and her berserker sons into this beautiful land and giving the evil yaksi dominion over it
1743398 this accursed forest you see was once the site of two great twin cities named malada and karusha
1743399 the lord of lanka did this with shrewd intent once before even lord indra washed his sins here this was the place where the great sage agastya made his home and hermitage it was here that originally tataka was cursed by the sage and transformed by his shraap into the ugly wretched yaksi she is now by releasing tataka into these same lands ravana could be certain of controlling her for she can never leave this tract of cursed forest to enter the world of prithvi herself this is her curse to eternally haunt the bhayanak van which as you know now was in fact once the blessed land malada karusha
1743400 and that is all that remains of the sacred waters of the holy ganga which fell to earth when lord indra washed his sins
1743401 the ganga that gutter of filth it looks more like a patalganga the river of hell
1743402 indeed young prince that is why the patalganga is so named because it is that stage of the holy ganga that traverses the netherworld once that sickly stream you see there was also pure and clear as the ganga itself tatakas foul presence has made it unclean
1743403 that way lies my ashram where my fellow rishis await my swift return once we have purified this haunted forest and restored it to its earlier glory it will become a place of prithvi once more reclaimed from patal the ganga will flow clear and pure once more and this land will regain its former flowering beauty which it enjoyed after indras blessings were showered upon it
1743404 how will we achieve this great and holy task gurudev how will we convert bhayanak van back into a part of prithvi once more
1743405 by killing tataka of course that is why we are here
1743406 this fight would be over in moments one way or another
1743407 it will be noonday in a few hours we would do well to wait and face tataka when the sun is at its highest point
1743408 in the meanwhile we must contend with tatakas horde of minions
1743409 none of the asuras you name young lakshman tataka was too proud to ask ravana for reinforcements to maintain her dominion or perhaps she feared that the lord of lanka might station a great force here and usurp her power to command so she created her own fighting force
1743410 by crossing the animals of these woods with her own rakshasa sons mutant beings not wholly animal rakshas or human with characteristics of all three she has been breeding these cross species monstrosities for a long time now and only recently ravana has commanded her to multiply her stocks as rapidly as possible he wishes to send them as berserkers and reivers north of the sarayu to terrorize the farmers in the outlying regions of kosala and other border kingdoms in less than a week he will issue the command for these terror forays to begin so we are here just in time to foil his plans
1743411 you will know them rajkumar do not be fooled by their somewhat familiar shapes and forms or even their speech for some are part human and retain a vestige of their human qualities these things are abominations of nature and creation mules synthetized by a corruption of brahman power and dark tantric acts of cross species engineering destroy them all once they are annihilated we can get on with our main purpose finding tataka and her sons and killing them only then can i go on to my ashram and complete the yagna in time
1743412 if i may ask one last question how many of these mutant berserkers might there be in the bhayanak van
1743413 tataka has been able to engender no more than a few hundred perhaps half a thousand at best surely no more than that
1743414 the bigfoot are closing should we ask them to keep their usual distance or close with us
1743415 what do you think bheriya look at the thickness of those woods do you think even the horse can get in there let alone our wheel i dont fancy the notion of walking in either
1743416 your professional opinion sooner or later youll have to start making command decisions might as well attempt a few while im around to catch you if you stumble
1743417 well if you want my honest opinion i think we should bring the bigfoot up forward and use them to punch a hole through those woods its the only way well get in there besides walking
1743418 or crawling which seems more likely if we attempt to get in there on our own
1743419 very good bheriya the same method we used in the charaka van during the kaikeya dasya uprising
1743420 maybe we could send a chariot or two ahead with those scimitars we got from the moorish delegates as a gift last year they might help to clear away some of that thornbush lurking between the trees the trees themselves look reedy enough i daresay our bigfoot could knock them down like shortstalks in a chaupat game
1743421 good good make that three chariot though abreast give the order
1743422 make it quick boy our scouts havent seen sight of the rajkumars since dawn today they could be halfway to lanka by now for all we know
1743423 i just wanted to say that its been a pleasure to serve under you these past four years youre the best sir
1743424 your tongue drips honey sweeter than a bees hive now get out of here before i whip you for insubordination
1743425 its been a pleasure to lead you too my son
1743426 scatter scatter keep apart from one another do it now scatter
1743427 he wants to be rama he only settles for being ramas brother
1743428 stop where you are lakshman he will not hesitate to shoot you down as he shot down all those monsters
1743429 put your bow aside i want to examine you i fear you may be wounded
1743430 he is caught in the battle fever of bala and atibala you felt some vestige of it too when you fought the maha mantras take you over at the moment of crisis and turn you into a perfectly efficient fighting engine that is what rama is now a perfect weapon fixed in a state of stasis that will pass once the crisis is truly past the only reason he does not shoot at you is because he senses your own brahman flow and essential goodness
1743431 but then why am i not in the same state why can i think and move freely while he sits there like a bowmans dummy aiming at me as if i were one of tatakas miscreations
1743432 the maha mantras affect each individual differently in ramas case they have taken strong root fear not young prince he will be as you knew him once the danger is over
1743433 but it is over isnt it they attacked and we slaughtered them there were no more left
1743434 sadly rajkumar you are wrong these were only the weakest and least effective of tatakas clutch she sent them first to test your strengths and weaknesses it is a common battle tactic used when facing a new enemy the next wave will comprise her best warriors and they will not be as easy to slaughter nor will they attack in any way you may foresee look for yourself these are mere cubs not fully mature even by their misshapen standards
1743435 you said there were no more than half a thousand of them
1743436 we faced and killed close to two hundred in that first attack almost half of their total numbers
1743437 numbers are not always a true indication of an enemys strength rajkumar these beasts you felled were immature and the weakest of the litter also they were the lesser miscreations of tatakas unholy experiments the berserkers that will attack you in this next wave will be more powerful than anything you have faced or heard of before these will be mixes of the larger more lethal predators elephant and hawk lion and rhino shark and falcon panther and scorpion eel and tiger vulture and hippo and besides these hybrids there will be trihybrids and tetrahybrids and even pentahybrids too the interbreeding so complex and mangled that tataka herself barely knows the full capability of those new breeds and keeps them caged even as we speak they are being freed
1743438 parantu mahadev we do not have that many arrows in our quivers how will we face such vast numbers
1743439 arrows do not concern yourself with such trivial concerns rajkumar lakshman i have seen to it that your quivers shall never go empty this is the advantage of being in a place where the laws of nature are so disrupted even as it makes it possible for ravana to work his vile sorcery it also makes it easier to channel the flow of brahman i have used a mantra that ensures that your arrows are replaced faster than you can loose them
1743440 andh tam pravishanti yeh avidyam upaste tatho bhuya eeva tey tamo ya u vidyayam ratah
1743441 asuryah namah tey loka andhyen tamasavratya tan asthey preytyabhigshanthi yeh keych atmahanah janah
1743442 sixty horse eight wheel and fifteen bigfoot we lost one to a missile before she could enter the woods
1743443 someones going to pay for this the cowardly bastards skulking in their crannies
1743444 show your faces you craven scum fight us face to face if you dare
1743445 what now our bigfoot are doing well enough but they cannot maintain this pace much longer
1743446 we scout ahead to find the river we follow its course until we find the rajkumars and the sage
1743447 and hear me well i dont care if those bigfoot bash their bloody brains out breaking through these wretched woods we stop only when we find the rajkumars or until we encounter the bastards who were pelting us do you follow
1743448 at last i meet you face to face legendary demon
1743449 do not be deceived by tatakas shrewd ingenuity she seeks to distract you with maya asuras are masters of illusion turn a deaf ear to her beauty and femininity and fulfill the duty with which i entrusted you slay the monster at once
1743450 do not delay rajkumar remember what i told you her power is weakest when the sun is highest this is why she uses these alluring disguises to delay and entice you hold fast to your dharmic duty and slay her at once
1743451 parantu gurudev she appears to be a woman rather than an asura kshatriya honor forbids me to kill a woman
1743452 do not be fooled by appearances rama this yaksi is guilty of a thousand crimes the devas themselves have sought her destruction time and time again remember the tale of kamas grove of how the devas sought for millennia to rouse lord siva from his million year tapasya it was to destroy this very being resurrected by ravanas sorcerous evil she assumes this bhes bhav to confuse you neither listen to her honeyed lies nor pay attention to her womanly attractions take up your weapon now and strike her down
1743453 rama do not fear her gargantuan size even though she has the strength of a thousand elephants she is no match for you and the shakti of the maha mantras bala and atibala
1743454 please i beg you do not force me to violate dharma by killing a woman i have done all you asked and will do all you ask in future but this command is beyond my ability to fulfill
1743455 rajkumar rama dharma is duty performed for the greater good this duty you must perform for the welfare of all the four castes for the sake of all mortalkind a king must do what serves his subjects best even if it seems unrighteous and distasteful for such is his dharma hear me well rajkumar lord indra most honorable of devas was compelled to kill the daughter of virocana because she sought the destruction of prithvi herself the very planet we inhabit lord vishnu the preserver killed bhrigus wife mother of kavya because she plotted to murder indra in ages past other kshatriya kings and princes such as yourself have committed this painful duty of stree hatya and they suffered the same doubts and hesitation you are experiencing you are not the first and you will not be the last warrior to kill a woman yet it must be done suppress your pity swallow your misgivings take up your bow and kill tataka while the sun approaches its zenith kill her now rama
1743456 rama listen to me boy i know your pain you are noble indeed to have such lofty ideals but it must be done and it must be done now
1743457 if not for yourself and your people then do it for your brother
1743458 see for yourself and weep brave prince of ayodhya there lies your courageous brother sumitra putra lakshmana reduced to a heap of shattered bones and tattered flesh a victim of this same tataka look at his remains and tell me now do you still believe this demoness to be nothing more than a beautiful woman
1743459 you are supreme in your knowledge of the divine shastras brahma himself gave you vidya of all mantras governing life death rebirth and resurrection no task is too great for your shakti i implore you return my brother in arms to the world of the living
1743460 there is a price to be paid for every spell that alters the balance of life and death the lord of death yama keeps precise accounts the scales must ever be balanced perfectly there are no exceptions if you would have me apply to him to restore rajkumar lakshman to his former state you must pay the price for his life with another life
1743461 i will pay the price with my own life if need be
1743462 that will not be enough the price for resurrection is dear one mortal soul will not meet yamarajs bill
1743463 then i will offer a dozen souls a hundred a thousand name the price sage and i will pay it i will reap a harvest of blood such as was never seen in all the three worlds
1743464 hear me then even all the mortal souls in the world are not enough to satisfy lord yama you could cleanse the world of all mortalkind as parasurama cleansed prithvi of every last living kshatriya thrice over and yet it would not pay the bill for your brothers soul there is only one life that the god of death will accept in exchange for your brothers
1743465 name the unfortunate wretch and he will not live to see the sun set today
1743466 nay even sunset would be much too late already yama is halfway back to patal on his red eyed black buffalo your brothers soul cached in his leopard skin pouch if he consigns lakshman to one of the many levels of hell it will be impossible to buy him back at any price the exchange must be done quickly enough to make yama retrace his steps at once within moments
1743467 it will be as you say seer now name the victim who will pay for my brothers resurrection
1743468 it is no mystery there she stands behind you the one responsible for your brothers death kill the yaksi demoness tataka and i will buy back your brothers life from the lord of death do it now for the sun is at its zenith or let the moment pass and go about collecting sandalwood for his funeral pyre
1743469 so be it begin the mantra rishi i will fulfill my part of the bargain
1743470 sage you seers have been my bane for too long today i shall destroy you and your mortal accomplices your kind can never resist the might and fury of the lord of lanka in the name of ravana
1743471 foolish mortal do you really believe you can harm me with your weapons i am tataka i have the strength of a thousand elephants it is not for nothing that i am known as gaja gamini the elephant footed
1743472 an elephant can be killed too as can a thousand
1743473 but you can try fleeing with the speed of a thousand gaja if you like it will not save you demoness
1743474 the sage told me to take you ahead he and your brother follow us on foot
1743475 why did you carry me in your chariot why did rama and gurudev not rouse me and let me walk my place is with them not riding like this
1743476 you were injured in the battle unconscious unfit to make the journey on foot i was ordered to carry you ahead to the sages ashram
1743477 i could have walked easily stop the chariot let me off here i will wait by the road for my brother and guru and continue on foot with them
1743478 shama my prince i have strict orders you are to be allowed to disembark only when we reach siddh ashrama
1743479 but we cant be going on to siddh ashrama yet we still had to kill the yaksi tataka and her rakshasa sons mareech and subahu
1743480 what happened to me commander i was wounded wasnt i
1743481 but where was i wounded i feel no injuries on my person i feel healthy invigorated fighting fit and hungry very very hungry
1743482 i am sure the rishis at the ashram will provide for your needs rajkumar we should reach there soon the sage said it was about eight or nine yojanas ahead we have already covered half that distance
1743483 i dont understand why was i unconscious for so long what happened after i lost my senses speak to me commander tell me
1743484 all i know rajkumar is that when my vajra and i caught up finally with the three of you you were in the bhayanak van and had fought a great battle against tataka and her minions we joined forces with you and eventually by your brothers great valor tataka was killed and the bhayanak van set ablaze if you look northwest you will see the fire even now
1743485 then we won we fought them all and we won you said you saw rama kill the yaksi
1743486 was she as terrible as the tales say she is a towering bloodthirsty rapacious demoness with the strength of a thousand elephants
1743487 she was the largest living being i have ever seen or heard tell of
1743488 and you say my brother downed her how did he achieve this commander give me the details
1743489 if only i had been awake to see it why did i have to be knocked unconscious at such a time rama had to do it all on his own
1743490 although i am sure you and your vajra must have fought hard alongside him i can tell that from the extent of your losses
1743491 rajkumar perhaps you would take some rest for a while and allow me to concentrate on steering us safely i am sure your brother and the sage will answer your questions once we reach the ashram
1743492 you must have lost some fine men in the southwoods
1743493 when we return to ayodhya i will tell my father you fought bravely he will raise a stone to the memory of your lost men
1743494 it could as easily have been me lying back there on the floor of the bhayanak van dead
1743495 and you too little brother so good to see you again
1743496 pranaam gurudev i apologize for not being in my senses during the battle with the yaksi and her sons
1743497 no need to apologize rajkumar you fought bravely doing more than your share we all play our own part in each conflict and oftentimes we serve the purpose of brahman in our own individual ways
1743498 i look forward to serving you now during your yagna mahaguru when will it begin
1743499 this very evening lakshman i am afraid you and your brother will have no sleep for the next seven nights you must stand guard and ensure that the rakshasas do not violate the ritual or the altar as they have done at earlier poojas this is no ordinary havan it is a maha yagna that must be completed without interruption
1743500 i am confident in your ability to fulfill your duty to the fullest extent
1743501 i am sure you will be more than a match for mareech and subahu when they arrive
1743502 and now i will go and purify myself in preparation for the yagna and you and your brother must do the same you may perform your sandhyavandana and take your acamana in the sacred confluence of the ganges and sarayu for this is siddh ashrama built on the sacred site where the great sage vamana once resided who as you well know was the famous dwarf avatar of lord vishnu descended to earth to regain prithvi from the demon bali
1743503 but that is a katha for another time perhaps when we are done with our yagna and are on the road back to ayodhya i may tell it to you now time is short and much work remains
1743504 did he say mareech and subahu but i thought you fought and killed them back in the bhayanak van when you killed tataka
1743505 lakshman my brother we have work to do it will be dusk in minutes and we still havent completed our evening prayers come well talk later
1743506 to honor your valor in the bhayanak van for cleansing the dread southwoods and razing it to the ground with purifying fire for killing the demoness yaksi tataka and ridding the world of her menace i grant you rajkumars rama and lakshmana the divine astras of the devas these mantras i communicate directly to your minds will give you the shakti to call upon any one of a hundred great astras despite their name these are not mere weapons each of these astras is in fact a celestial being a shining demigod from swarga lok the highest of the three worlds the mantras compell them to serve you at your will speak any mantra and the corresponding shining one will be at your command instantly accept these divine weapons now as reward for your triumph in bhayanak van
1743507 why did you block my way bhai i would have destroyed both of them with manus astra they would both be dead now instead you let mareech escape
1743508 his injury was grave he fell far out in the ocean he wont survive
1743509 just because i was knocked unconscious once doesnt mean im helpless bhai i can fight as well as you can i dont need your protection big brother
1743510 no i did what i thought was right at the time im sorry if i hurt your pride lakshman it wont happen again
1743511 and great sacrifice soon we will return to ayodhya where you will resume your lives as royal princes of your illustrious line your father will be proud of how well you conducted yourselves on this your first spiritual mission and the people will rejoice in the knowledge that you accomplished the cleansing of the dread bhayanak van no more will aryas fear to enter those fearsome woods again in a generation or two they will be the site of cities as great as ayodhya and mithila and you made all this possible my young shishyas you have done me proud
1743512 vajra commander bejoo insists on accompanying us back on our return journey and i have consented to allow him to fulfill his orders
1743513 his associate bheriya will ride back to the capital to inform maharaja dasaratha with the good news so that when you return home you will be welcomed back with full pomp and ceremony as befits two victorious princes of ayodhya
1743514 kshatriya on behalf of all at siddh ashrama i thank you for your service in the duty of your rajkumars even though you disobeyed my wishes by following us your sacrifices in bhayanak van more than absolved you of your error
1743515 you are too kind mahadev will the rajkumars and yourself start their return journey today
1743516 yes good man but we shall not be returning directly to ayodhya we shall be visiting mithila first
1743517 but that will take us a full two days out of our way the rajkumar rama chandra is to be crowned prince heir on his sixteenth naming day less than eight days from now
1743518 and he shall return in time for the coronation but this detour is unavoidable i have important business in mithila and i would prefer that the rajkumars attend me after all do not forget that they are still oath sworn to me until such time as i hand them over personally to their father the maharaja
1743519 as you say mahadev with your permission i shall dispatch my associate to ayodhya at once with this news as well as the earlier information aagya gurudev
1743520 why does bejoo chacha look at me so strangely as if ive grown four ears or something i just dont understand it he used to be so nice to me back when we were boys
1743521 if you will pardon my asking what business requires your presence in mithila
1743522 i wish i knew all sumantra would tell me was that the guru had something important to discuss with us
1743523 this is why i have called you here tonight to warn you
1743524 show them to us guruji well cut them down like ripe wheat
1743525 your eagerness for action is understandable rajkumar shatrugan but these traitors cannot be dealt with as easily as you would like
1743526 after all theyre mortal arent they we caught and imprisoned thirteen spies in the city dungeon why cant we root out and imprison these ones as well
1743527 patience good bharat hear me out first i have just had a very disturbing encounter in that same city dungeon and that is what prompts my speaking to you at this unearthly hour
1743528 we have heard all sorts of rumors is it true that those prisoners melted into milky fluid and vanished down a crack in the floor of the dungeon
1743529 rani sumitra the truth might be more than you can stand to hear especially at the end of a day fraught with so much stress i understand that the maharaja has regained consciousness
1743530 he is disturbed it is probably a result of his deteriorating condition he has been having strange dreams
1743531 i will go to him when we are done here but i wish you all to promise me that not a word of what we speak here will reach his ears
1743532 this is not conspiracy young bharat conspiracy is what our enemies are brewing right now even as we speak but to set your mind at rest let me remind you that with your father incapacitated the burden of the kingdom falls on the shoulders of pradhan mantri sumantra first queen kausalya maa and yourself
1743533 yes dasaratha putra for until your brother rama returns home safe and sound you must be regarded as the crown prince in waiting
1743534 i would not like to explain further i believe you understand that part well enough
1743535 you learned something from the spies that made you call us together is it not so what was it
1743536 you are wise beyond your years kausalya the devas have gifted you with an acute analytical mind kosala could do worse than to have you reigning as regent after the maharaja passes on
1743537 you are quite right i learned something in the dungeon that alarmed me greatly i thought i had the measure of the current crisis i regret to say i had only part measure of the whole situation the rot that brahmarishi vishwamitra and i sensed is riper than we believed the demon lord of lanka has his claws far deeper in the body of this great arya nation that either of us thought
1743538 i mean only to say that ravanas influence is far greater than any of us suspected not only has he planted spies in the royal court he has gained influence over the throne of ayodhya itself
1743539 that one of the royal family is secretly loyal to ravana
1743540 can it be true then guruji can such a thing really have happened
1743541 but that would mean that one of us is a traitor
1743542 and yet it is so after my encounter in the dungeon i know this to be true one of the royal family is a traitor to the arya nations and a supporter of the king of asuras plotting and conspiring to destroy us all and aide ravana in his scheme to ravage and conquer the mortal world
1743543 shes the only one left and the only one with a motive to conspire against the throne because she seeks to overturn ramas ascension and make me maharaja after my fathers passing
1743544 and i would sooner die than see her succeed in her intentions my mother she is and for that i shall always show her respect but on this matter i will not support her either rama will become maharaja or ayodhya will remain kingless this i swear in the presence of my guru
1743545 so what was that faisal saleh hayat then then interior miniter kept telling us about dr aafia siddiqui
1743546 honey why do you always cut the ends off of the pot roast
1743547 i dont know my mother always cut the ends off the pot roast
1743548 well lets call your mother on the phone and ask her why she does that
1743549 i dont know maybe because my mother always cut the ends off the pot roast
1743550 grandma why do you cut the ends off the pot roast
1743551 in both cases the range between the upper and lower confidence limits includes 1 000 so both schools are achieving average outcomes their performance is about as expected
1743552 no meaning can be attached to an absolute cva value and any ranking of schools by their cva values is meaningless
1743553 the top 100 schools using the contextual value added measure
1743554 scores above 1 000 represent schools where students on average made more progress than similar students nationally while scores below 1 000 represent schools where students made less progress
1743555 a measure of 1 006 means that on average each of the schools students achieved the equivalent of one gcse grade higher in one subject than the average attained by similar students
1743556 conversely a score of 994 means that the schools students achieved one grade lower in one subject on average while a score of 952 means that students achieved on average one grade lower in each of their best eight subjects
1743557 the data are only as good as the process that produce them and only reflect attainment as measured by specific exercises undertaken on a specific day
1743558 objections will always be possible it may be argued that assessment is flawed or the exercises test only certain kinds of attainment in certain ways
1743559 imperfect as they inevitably are these assessments have been developed and honed over time and their reliability is high
1743560 and people often only test what they feel they can measure
1743561 the pictures of me on the internet were silly inappropriate shots
1743562 i never intended for any of this to happen and i am truly sorry
1743563 she watched it with rapt attention and occasionally whispered to her assistant about it
1743564 speak the kings english evelyn had to learn it back for her new role
1743565 scarletts had two husbands and im going to be an old maid
1743566 hollywood was left gasping by the swift moving romance huston and miss keyes who met but a month ago were dining at mike romanoffs when huston said listen honey theres no point in waiting any further lets get married now miss keyes assented and while huston was making arrangements to charter a plane host romanoff hurried home to secure an old fashioned gold wedding band that he explained had been lost by a guest in his swimming pool
1743567 it is therefore difficult to conclude with any reasonable level of certainty that any one of those users was actually using the ip address in question at the relevant time
1743568 we believe in these two instances that it would be unfair to identify all possible individuals meeting the plaintiffs criteria given the low likelihood of identifying the guilty party
1743569 dont be afraid but there seems to be one of those huge macys thanksgiving day balloons following us
1743570 18 gratuity added to parties with more than five credit cards
1743571 what i show the general public is my positive side
1743572 i am human this has been a roller coaster ride this isnt just the flu this is cancer its on my mind constantly i cant help it thats just how its going to be
1743573 im altering the deal calrissian pray i dont alter it further
1743574 he was making adjustments and that s what the game is all about he didn t throw off speed until the second time around he threw all fastballs and one changeup the first time around the third time around he brought the slider out he knew what he was doing he didn t want us to see all his pitches he s kind of bright
1743575 he did a great job throwing strikes man from the first inning on he was pounding the strike zone he had great movement he reminds you a lot of kenny rogers he changed speeds big sinker and he fielded his position he was an athlete on the mound he knew what he was doing it s a perfect example of if you can throw strikes and keep the ball down you can have success in this league
1743576 i know you have to give credit to the guy but you also have to give credit to the guy behind the plate ramon hernandez he called a great game he knows those guys if ramon called the best pitch and he threw it the way he wanted i think he was going to be fine that s what this kid did whatever ramon called for the spot he hit the spot no problem

1743581 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
1743582 i keep having to explain to people that this isnt necessarily bad that if the yankees were sure he needed surgery its more likely that they would have kept him in new york with dave altchek well know more after the visit but indications are that chamberlain has some damage but that surgery is not an immediate indication so far the yankees are only willing to say that chamberlain will miss his next start but theyre also giving off signs that chamberlain will need to go onto the dl the biggest worry is the location of the pain while the team is insisting that the center of the shoulder is good thats still one location where referred pain shows up for the labrum
1743583 we actually had agreed on terms we were right there things just didnt pan out i just want to let fans know that im not the one that pulled it off the table that we just didnt see eye to eye on a couple things and that was it
1743584 this case has been mischaracterized there are a lot more complicated issues than just copyright or trademark there are more complex issues than those in respect to the end user licensing agreement and antitrust issues come into play too

1743610 in the coming days its going to be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain

1743613 this sixth generation of golf cars will completely redefine the quality and comfort level of its class over broad categories offering more customer value than ever before
1743614 we have cast the golfs core components in a precise new mold
1743615 the golf is the global icon car making so the architecture and graphic form of new model are also absolutely clear and unique
1743616 it is more accentuated more three dimensional than its predecessor with precisely defined lines and edges and with finely proportioned flared surfaces and recesses
1743617 not to be snarky but the allmusic bio refers to terry karydes as
1743618 i vaguely recall the toadies from the heyday of alternative when bands that sounded like puddle of mudd covering zz top could slide a song on radio playlists
1743619 i think there were a few mike stands that stayed in the truck investigators are going to look for any elements that can help them try to find possible suspects
1743620 are there any fingerprints in the car were any elements left on the scene that might help them find possible leads in this case
1743621 while the uk pop scene suffers from a surfeit of homogenous guitar rock american music is enjoying a golden moment literary bands with songs that revel in intricate language complex narratives and cinematic plot twists are on the rise so if you are looking for an alternative to identikit indie the wait is over
1743622 well of course i dont agree with harm reduction who would
1743623 one thing i heard from addictions doctors is that they really want more facilities for people who are still using which aa type programs wont accept
1743624 allowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction it is the opposite we believe it is a form of harm addition
1743625 safe injecting sites are not a new intervention but simply a repackaging of existing who recommended interventions such as needle exchanges etc
1743626 they enable known who recommended harm reduction interventions to be delivered and used in a safe environment with the aim of reaching the most marginalized and vulnerable of injecting drug users
1743627 canada is proud to be the largest contributor to the who
1743628 we need to stop arguing about the merits of harm reduction and just do it
1743629 it may seem like they are legalizing heroin and other drugs which they are not
1743630 it is high time every country in the world resolutely embraced the full spectrum of harm reduction among injecting drug users not doing so will only perpetuate the spread of hiv

1743647 with this investment fedex is showing confidence in our community
1743648 if this comes to fruition it will be because of months of behind the scenes work and a strong partnership between the city and the kokomo howard county development corporation
1743649 this proposed project also shows that international companies like fedex view kokomo as a strong community and as a place to expand and invest

1743656 its like when one door closes im in a time of rediscovery from my career to my personal style
1743657 their wedding is something ive been promoting for some time now
1743658 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1743659 i dont know if a politician has ever offered a more pitch perfect response to the idiocy of the modern day gop
1743660 obama is never better than when hes intellectually indignant this was true on negotiating with dictators it was true on the gas tax holiday and its proving true on tire gauges if i were on the obama campaign the themes laid out in this video wouldnt simply be my rejoinder to the gops tire gauge bullshit theyd be my message for the next few months
1743661 my gut says that given the way shallow national politics works obama will lose this exchange and wind up sounding like a dukakisian know it all but im tempered by the example of his fight with hillary clinton over her empty gas tax holiday proposal which obama corectly derided as a political gimmick
1743662 i dont think it was quite pitch perfect maybe a touch too eggheady with the mention of experts but deriding the gop for embracing ignorance was a nice way to invert mccains charge id guess this resonates more than usual after eight years of george w bush and obama delivered the riff in the right tone not angry or righteous but bemused this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it even more effective was obamas jujitsuing of mccains celeb ad again with the possible exception of the word experts this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference its a great punchline it really flays the gop for a being out of touch about what matters to voters and b the partys less than high minded campaign tactics but it does all this with the same light hand if obama adopts this as a standard refrain that ad could end up backfiring on mccain
1743663 the whole tire gauge dust up is useful because it sheds light on the different species of mockery the two campaigns are directing at each other the realm of mockery being one where the gop has enjoyed a distinct advantage in the last two presidential elections for the moment obama is striking a lighter tone at times than the gop is something that represents a change from the last election the gops mockery of obama this time around the celeb ad the tire gauge stunt has a kind of grating adolescent forced quality to it last time the gops mockery of john kerry had a kind of effortless quality that just isnt there right now another factor pundits and opinion makers for a host of reasons just dont seem to be as willing or as able to join in the gop mockery of obama as they were four years ago against kerry sure theres plenty of the usual media clowning but it tends to come across as flailing the punches just arent really landing
1743664 i think itll backfire just because most people even right wingers want to find a way to save money on gas if inflating tires works which it does theyll notice it all right
1743665 but the problem isnt that republicans denied that air pressure could save fuel the problem is that obamas math was way off powerline did the math and under no scenario do you get to savings equal to offshore drilling so who is ignorant and who needs to talk to the experts
1743666 so is it true that we can save as much oil by inflating our tires and getting regular tuneups as theyre talking about getting off drilling yes i assume that obama is comparing the oil saved by inflating tires and getting tuneups to the amount of oil we could get by drilling offshore in currently restricted areas when the mccain campaign says that senator obamas solution to high gas prices is telling americans to make sure their tires are inflated its as though they were saying we are going to adopt a strategy that will force you the voters to spend hours of your lives checking each and every one of our statements for accuracy we have no respect for the value of your time nor do we respect your intellect or your civic engagement if we did we wouldnt adopt a strategy that can only work if voters are too apathetic to notice that what were saying is false its a curious strategy for someone who claims to put country first and to care about honor
1743667 obama said a couple of days ago says we all should inflate our tires i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it
1743668 the mccain campaign appears intent on trying to win the daily media battles even to the bane of crafting a broader narrative on what their campaign is about what their candidate stands for and what type of president he would be ive always thought this to be a risky strategy but it is a tremendously risky strategy when the meme starts to take hold that a candidate will say anything even things that he distances himself from just days later to get elected weve already seen this from mccain who has changed his position on almost every single major and even minor issue facing the country and whose campaign has been forced to walk back criticisms of obama think the visit to the military base in germany or the claims about obamas tax plan that were exposed as wholly false now mccain is being forced to back away from yet another claim again feeding the story line that he will say anything even claims he must walk back just days later to become president
1743669 i told her with a little luck she could be the only lady to serve as first lady and miss buffalo chip
1743670 miss buffalo chip isnt a beauty contest in the traditional sense its a relatively debauched topless and sometimes bottomless multiday contest where women dance jiggle and reportedly even perform blow jobs on bananas for the titillation of the spectators and john mccain offered up his 54 year old wife as a contestant he did it to pander to the crowds idea of appropriate masculinity and that apparently includes over sexualizing your wife and the mother of your children for the amusement of a few people in a crowd mccain offered up the thought of his wife objectifying herself for the sexual gratification of others at his suggestion in order to get a couple of chuckles inspire some male fantasy and make a few friends fun i think its another piece of gravel in a growing mountain of evidence that john mccain doesnt think a lot about women their place as equals in society or their rights in that society but he does seem to think a lot about us as sexual beings or at least sexual objects
1743671 so if we are going to have a conversation about character lets consider john mccains view of women in his life and women in general
1743672 hello all of you anti obama zealots got misogyny thats your man john mccain a
1743673 all im saying is that if barack obama had gone to an event with 20 000 people wasting gas to talk about energy and said that his wife should have simulated sucking a banana dick between another womans legs this race would be fucking
1743674 i think the issue here is that mccain is so out of touch that he had no idea what he was talking about if he knew it was nude event i cant imagine he would have said he wanted to see cindy in it hes not that stupid the point im making is that while john mccain was trying to position himself as the bikers best friend the truth is that hes a 520 shoe wearing elitist and a total phony at sturgis hes got nothing more in common with the harley riding bike ralliers there than george bush does with a true rancher in texas does america really want another faker in the white house
1743675 were wasting our time beating up on john mccain for suggesting that his leathery ol wife should participate in a topless bottomless beauty pageant yes obama couldnt say it but then obama isnt a notorious ladies man and adulterer that dumped his first wife when she went and got all ugly and shit more to the point and setting aside the issue of race people think its cute when the elderly pretend that theyve still got it and say mildly racy not racist things about their leathery ol spouses these comments would be interpreted very differently if obama made them not because obama is black or a democrat but because obama is young and virile and his wife is a total fucking fox if obama had suggested that michelle enter a topless beauty pageant we would be forced to actually conjure up mental images of michelle taking part because michelle could and she could win when mccain says it about cindy we dont picture cindy entering the contest because she couldnt and on the off chance that she did she certainly wouldnt win it people dont perceive sexual heat or sexual tension in mccains marriage and therefore they dont perceive any in his comments the people in that crowd and the people watching the clip on youtube interpret them like this hey the old dude still thinks his old wife is hot awww isnt that cute democrats and progressives straining to make an issue of this by playing if obama said it are making a mistake were not the party of idiotic knee jerk prudery and we look ridiculous when we pretend that we are
1743676 paris hilton makes fun of john mccains age and unveils her own energy policy really update obama spokesman
1743677 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling
1743678 and so it comes to this were in the midst of a heated presidential contest an energy crisis looms the economy is on the skids and i come before you today to once again write about paris hilton
1743679 i write this in full knowledge that i am fanning the flames of this distracting devolution into the realm of actual celebrities but as long as millions of people are going to be listening to paris hilton on energy far more than might have tuned in for mccains remarks here and because this is important stuff we may as well run it through the vine fact checker
1743680 there is a sense that because of his unique background and temperament obama lives apart he put one foot in the institutions he rose through on his journey but never fully engaged as a result voters have trouble placing him in his context understanding the roots and values in which he is ineluctably embedded
1743681 the column would seem all in all a fairly round condemnation of the presumptive democratic nominee non committal calculating other while emotional engagement can be of course a liability for a candidate see scream dean automaton like coolness is perhaps even more of one and there are few things worse for a politician to be in americans eyes than calculating while brooks mentions the positive side of obamas in out dichotomy his fantastic powers of observation his skills as a writer and thinker and the fact that people on almost all sides of any issue can see parts of themselves reflected in obamas eyes
1743682 brooks summarily tears apart obamas entire career as if its truly meaningless that obamas a self made success with infinitely more impressive credentials than say george bush gets lost on brooks his job as a conservative pundit is not to speak the truth about republicans but to distort the truth about democrats but the truth is obama is the american dream personified of mixed race heritage and from a poor broken home he made his way into the finest academic institutions in the country and became the first ever black editor of the prestigious harvard law review he spent years as a community organizer 12 years as a law professor 6 years as a state senator 3 as a u s senator and stands the best chance of anyone in history of becoming the first black president yet brooks column conjures up the image of some emotionless spiritless disconnected automaton who somehow managed to accomplished this greatness without ever having any real intimate relationships or intellectual curiosity that he somehow robotically drifted his way to being some sort of comatose like wonder having fooled everyone and touched no one give us a break brooks
1743683 whats preposterous about this is that our last three republican presidents all benefited from an utterly phony sense of rootedness
1743684 obama is well aware of this ambiguity in his image and cultivates it he has written that he serves as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes can project their own views more recently he said that he has become a symbol of americas best traditions he was rather unfairly pilloried by john mccain for this rather than self glorification he was trying to deflect attention from himself to say its not about me elsewhere he referred to himself as just the excuse he seeks to remove or at least blur any fixed notions of who he is or what he stands for from the campaign he embraces ambiguity
1743685 brooks actually has interesting things to say about obamas pattern of being in and out at the same time a liminal figure who seems to have issues with committing to institutions whilst using them for his own benefit a calculated ambiguity one might call it fascinating how someone so averse to committee work would want to preside
1743686 look the answer is a lot simpler the usa is still a 50 50 country or maybe more precisely a 47 47 country the gop brand name is in trouble these days but the vast bulk of the people who voted for bush 43 twice dole bush 41 twice and reagan twice arent likely to be swept off their feet by obamamania the plurality of american voters who still self identify as conservative arent going to be an easy sell for a left liberal product of the chicago machine the narrow swath of people who are really in play dont produce landslides in sum just because media elites manhattanites and hollywoodistas are swooning over obama doesnt mean hes going to win the center right heartland
1743687 the second factor id argue is paradoxically democratic strength the shift away from the gop is pronounced everywhere democracy hasnt failed completely and few doubt that the dems could make big gains in both house and senate this fall so the threat of the kind of republican agenda that propelled bush from 2002 to 2006 is much diminished mccain moreover is not so bad a figure to deal with a democratic congress from the perspective of many independent voters especially since the congress is pretty much reviled as well so the choice becomes an all democratic government headed by a senator whose newness is still one of the most striking things about him or an old war horse who ticked off all the right republicans at one point or other and who was more right about the sruge than obama obamas hopes for a landslide therefore rest on the chance that economic distress will now do to the public mood what iraq once did and make bold change seem necessary
1743688 the big story isnt so much how asbahi would have been a threat to the us as a member of obamas campaign answer not much but in how inept obama and his team are at background checks these will be the same people who appoint people to government posts if obama wins the election how many of these mistakes will occur then competence usually comes with experience and obama doesnt demonstrate much of either
1743689 i dont think anyone during the primary accused bill clinton of being a racist as in i dont think black people are equal to whites he was accused of race baiting some of it was from my perspective dubious deriding obamas identity as a guy who consistently opposed the iraq war as a fairy tale is not only fair but actually kind of true but i thought the infamous south carolina jesse jackson comparison was race bating either that or it was just foolishly dismissive nevertheless it amazes me that clinton is actually still pissed off about this idea that hes a racist of course its telling that hes turned the very specific charge of race baiting into a much larger much easier to attack charge of racism i have no doubt that obamas surrogates worked behind the scenes to push the clinton race baiting angle while obama angelically smiled and claimed to take no offense but thats what people do when theyre running for office the whole clinton appeal was based on this idea that they would fight dirty that they could counter the republican attack machine that politics was basically dirty and to win you had to be willing to fight that way how then can you be mad that you lost to someone who fought dirty wouldnt you have done the same thing

1743694 in the spirit of freedom and science ssi commissioned this report to respond to questions and arguments regarding professor duesbergs unanswered questions of dr gallos 1984 hiv hypothesis as an independent investigator who could not be influenced by the threats or attacks made against vulnerable ssi members and others and as someone who had never heard of duesberg gallo farber or aids denialism before may 2008 ssi believed that this investigator had the unbiased and proven investigative experience necessary to examine both sides of the controversy for his efforts this investigator was not compensated
1743695 based upon the evidence contained in this report this investigator must agree with hundreds of reputable scientists and doctors who remain unconvinced that dr gallos retrovirus is real or has anything to do with the disease called aids as i looked at the evidence against duesberg and farber i found evidence of prevarication subterfuge libel and criminal behavior on the gallo side against that pnas published science of duesbergs side
1743696 to pretend we can ever get hold of this without dealing with that the idea of unprotected sexual relations with unlimited numbers of partners i think would be na ve

1743707 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant

1743711 its certainly a whole lot sharper than it was early this morning thad feels to me as if the first cold wave of the winter had struck scranton
1743712 the ice on our flooded baseball field and that out at hobsons mill pond ought to be in great shape after a hard freeze to night hugh
1743713 were in luck this time chum thad look at that sky will you never a cloud in sight and the sun going down yellow deacon winslow our reliable old weather prophet blacksmith who always keeps a goose bone hanging up in his smithy to tell what sort of a winter were going to get says such a sign stands for cold and clear to morrow after that kind of a sunset red means warmer you know
1743714 i only hope it keeps on for forty eight hours more thats all i can say hugh this being thursday it would fetch us to saturday i understand theyre not meaning to let a single pair of steel runners on the baseball park to mark the smooth surface of the new ice until saturday morning
1743715 which will be a fine thing for our hockey try out with the scratch seven eh thad
1743716 we want to test our team play before going up against the boys of keyport high thats a fact and scranton can put up a hard fighting bunch of irregulars there are some mighty clever hockey players in and out of the high school who are not on our seven i guess there ought to be a pretty lively game on saturday and there will be if several fellows i could mention line up against us

1743725 one other memory i hold dear is running high up in boulder colorado with yuko arimori the japanese silver medalist in the marathon at the barcelona olympics this was just some light jogging but still coming from japan and running all of a sudden at a height of ten thousand feet was very tough my lungs screamed and i felt dizzy and terribly thirsty miss arimori gave me a cool look and just said is something the matter mr murakami i learned how rigorous the world of professional runners is though i should add that shes a very kind person by the third day though my body had gotten used to the thin atmosphere and i could enjoy the crisp air of the rockies

1743730 i was surrounded by men who had cement dust in their hair and sawdust under their fingernails they had nicotine sallowed faces that looked like ritual masks and their hands were as tough and scarred as falcon gloves these were men who as one of them told me later had been shoveling shit their whole lives

1743745 this is a very important piece that she has written
1743746 she criticizes the recent awarding of the sanlam prizes for afrikaans fiction to authors harry kalmer and erika murray theron as typical of what is going wrong
1743747 kalmers piece is somewhat nervous flat and surely unintentionally pretentious but with a nice spark here and there though they dont necessarily treat the objective issues hambidge raises the sparks kalmer says he tolerates hambidge like he tolerates modern talking certainly the world would be a better place without it but the world isnt perfect a lack of insight empathy and intellectual flair in a reviewer like hambidge can even make bataille freud and bart simpson sound banal he ends off countering hambidges crique on light literature by saying the only book hambidge ever wrote that he liked happened to be one with light ambitions she should he implies get back to it

1743766 i welcome todays guilty verdict in the first trial held under the military commissions act mca this process of bringing terrorists to justice has been too long delayed but im encouraged that it is finally moving forward i supported that legislation which was a good faith effort by congress to meet the supreme courts direction to establish a process to bring terrorist detainees to trial salim ahmed hamdan a trusted confidante of osama bin laden was provided a full hearing of the charges against him and was represented by counsel who vigorously defended him the jury found that the prosecution lawyers had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that hamdan had aided terrorists by supplying weapons to al qaeda and taliban forces in afghanistan this process demonstrated that military commissions can effectively bring very dangerous terrorists to justice the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully unlike senator obama who voted against the mca and favors giving al qaeda terrorists direct access to u s civilian courts to contest their detention i recognize that we cannot treat dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield as we would common criminals
1743767 we did have a chance to talk a little sports and a little family backstage but that was completely normal not political

1743772 because as youve heard me time and time again say a new tanker is urgently needed for our warfighters and so we are trying to move along as quickly and as thoroughly as possible
1743773 pelosi is thumbing her nose at the needs of american who cant afford the cost of gas
1743774 americans who wont be able to afford gas in the future
1743775 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights bush said today
1743776 and i have met repeatedly with chinese dissidents and religious believers
1743777 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential he said
1743778 we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
1743779 human nature is universal and needs to pursue freedom and equality
1743780 one question on the minds of many here in asia and many around the world is the future direction of china bush said in thailand today
1743781 i have been fascinated by china since my first trip there in 1975 when my dad was head of the united states liaison office in beijing
1743782 over the years america has had complex relations with china he said
1743783 when i took office i was determined to set our relationship on a sturdy principled footing
1743784 we are disappointed that the doha round of trade talks has stalled and we will continue to engage china and other nations to help reach a successful conclusion
1743785 america has also established a new strategic economic dialogue with china where we discuss ways to ensure long term growth and widely shared prosperity in both our economies as well as issues like currency exchange rates and intellectual property rights the president said
1743786 through these discussions and others we are making clear to china that being a global economic leader carries with it the duty to act responsibly on matters from energy to the environment to development in africa
1743787 america and china have found other key areas of cooperation
1743788 but were going to need an emergency order of tempura green beans
1743789 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1743790 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know im like totally ready to lead
1743791 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars energy crisis solved ill see you at the debates bitches
1743792 remember that when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this
1743793 obama told a crowd at a gym in youngstown ohio
1743794 john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1743795 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it
1743796 people care not only what you say but how you vote
1743797 d clarait le 22 juillet le directeur g n ral des

1743805 not only do i feel traditional routes are less necessary to achieving stardom i dont think theyre a prerequisite at all
1743806 allie never did any traditional modeling or worked with any of the large studios and shes still managed to achieve a following thats far greater than most models who have taken those routes
1743807 the internet can catapult an aspiring starlet to fame literally overnight
1743808 unlike brick and mortar outlets which can take months of production and marketing to promote a new model the girl next door can shoot a video from her bedroom this afternoon post it to the web tonight and thanks to the viral nature of the web she can be on her way to stardom before she get out of bed in the morning
1743809 give a girl a webcam and hook her up with all the tube sites and community sites and she can be a star
1743810 the web offers the opportunity to reach a more diverse fan base
1743811 and it also affords the models the ability to have more personal interaction with their fans if the model makes all her customers special and remembers from day one that every single customer is whats important she will go far
1743812 my experience with web fame was a bit overwhelming at first
1743813 i would have never thought that starting my own amateur website would have led to being recognized at the grocery store or the mall on a regular basis but it has ive gotten used to it now and i have a lot of fun with it its really cool meeting fans in person
1743814 our models are real college girls not porn stars they are more approachable to the average guy there are guys who just arent into seeing women getting fucked by groups of random men our models appeal to the guys that prefer women to be innocent and inexperienced not slutty and used up
1743815 some of the biggest most popular single girls all have one thing in common they look innocent but yet arent
1743816 the guys seem real and fun and most times very funny
1743817 people like the kind of guy they can have a beer with and i think our guys are like that you can be a god when it comes to looks but if you dont have a personality to go with it who cares
1743818 getting an affiliate to promote a model is very similar to getting a surfer to join her site
1743819 we promote our models to our affiliate network first if an affiliate is tempted to join her site himself he will be much more likely to promote her when a surfer sees a model on many different sites he might decide he needs to see for himself what the buzz is about
1743820 we take advantage of every opportunity to get allies name out there by posting on forums doing live webcam appearances and interviews on fan based sites getting affiliates to write reviews of her site et cetera
1743821 you just have to do everything possible to get your name out there in front of fans
1743822 we advertise only with non nude material leaving fans wanting more and more
1743823 i get a lot of type in traffic because i am always promoting myself in the mainstream world and in adult always mentioning your site name is important even if you think people are sick of hearing it internet fame comes from hard work you can have the best looking site in the world but if no one knows your web address then you are nothing
1743824 weve launched dozens of sites for different models but some have underperformed even using the same promotion and marketing techniques as the ones that skyrocketed
1743825 i think fans have grown weary of all the overhyped crap on the web just giving allies fans an opportunity to see that theres a real person behind her site has created a level of loyalty that i would never have expected when we first started her site
1743826 you need to let the model be who she is rather than try to make her into something else
1743827 you cant try to turn someone like liz vicious into americas sweetheart
1743828 keeping people guessing about what youre going to do next
1743829 you always have to be willing to take chances and not always think of the bottom line
1743830 when you see someone who has potential you work with them to bring it out its really about showcasing their talents whatever they are
1743831 every model isnt cut out to be an internet star
1743832 ive been pressured into opening new sites for models that i wasnt 100 percent behind ive learned to trust my instincts ive regretted every time i didnt
1743833 it all lies in the hands of the webmasters and the customers
1743834 you can offer people steak and sometimes all they want is hamburger ill never completely understand what makes a star so i just offer quality sites with quality girls and let the world decide whos next
1743835 i am not sympathetic to paul vi because so many suffered because of his dreamy incompetence and
1743836 abortion would be a sacrament if women were in charge abortion should be a sacrament even today i suspect that for many women today and for their spouses lovers families and communities abortion is celebrated as such an occasion of deep and serious and sacred meaning
1743837 in rome in fact the fear is that the number of ordained women will continue to increase

1743863 insurance marketing executives often find it difficult to feel confident about how to integrate social media into their marketing mix theyre concerned about finding ways to measure and integrate new technologies and interactions and deal with this new world
1743864 it changes your marketing from one that speaks at audiences to one that fosters bringing people and brands together
1743865 once insurance marketers have learned what their customers desire they can use that knowledge to create specific content that is tailored to their wants and needs
1743866 one of the basic questions to ask when developing strategies and tactics concerning social media is how can we make our brand more than just talking about insurance

1743870 the national parole board is an independent decision making tribunal that plays a significant role in contributing to the safety of our communities making it imperative that we appoint highly qualified and committed people
1743871 we did our homework methodically reviewing 13 systems for more than a year

1743879 organizations can be pro active valuing employees and their input before there are murmurs of unionization
1743880 although union talks focus on pay benefits and job security leaders can create an environment that satisfies employees needs in these less tangible areas which may temper us versus them thinking with less of a gap between management and employees a union contract may not be necessary
1743881 it is with great pleasure and pride that village health clubs can help special olympics arizona in their efforts to promote healthy lifestyles and fun spirited competition

1743886 we continue to be pleased with the results of drilling at vizcachitas especially the 209 2 metre intersection in lav 131 which is the best drilled by los andes on the project to date this intersection is particularly significant as the hole is collared close to the southern limit of known mineralization los andes continues to drill with the aim of increasing the already significant resource recently announced for the vizcachitas deposit

1743889 coach called a blitzing play and theres no o line in 7 on 7 so im free he threw the ball and i swatted it down
1743890 he said with an offensive line you would have gotten cut
1743891 i talk as much noise as i can to him
1743892 because i know hes a competitor hes going to bring it right back
1743893 were on top of that stuff pretty good but sometimes its through the high school or the clearinghouse or the testing sites

1743908 it would be impossible to comment without reviewing the full text of this so called exoneration it still seems like questionable judgment was employed and some very questionable decisions were made but if mayor ravenstahl wants to reinstate mr ford thats something were all going to have to deal with moving forward
1743909 i am quite enthusiastic about the results returned from our exploration projects to date this year we anticipate further good news in the coming months especially from the alex breccia zone where the potential to expand resources at depth is excellent and the san pedro area where we have already announced several new vein discoveries

1743946 o risco que reconhe a que o crescimento est a abrandar mais rapidamente do que o previsto
1743947 i am not sympathetic to paul vi because so many suffered because of his dreamy incompetence and
1743948 for all the outrages against the blessed sacrament around the world
1743949 close observation of the film and of the facts seems to suggest that this is not an elaborate hoax but depicts something that really occurred
1743950 the conversion of the culprits that they will answer gods call to repentance and open their hearts to receive his forgiveness
1743951 the catholic church forfeits all rights to respect for its ludicrous beliefs including transubstantiation while its anti condom campaign in africa results in tens of thousands of deaths
1743952 just because you believe that the cracker has some special significance doesnt mean that i have to respect that ridiculous belief i think the moral cost of disrespecting a cracker is a lot less than the moral cost of disrespecting human life a concept that should be more important to you people
1743953 i thought of a simple quick thing to do i pierced it with a rusty nail i hope jesuss tetanus shots are up to date and then i simply threw it in the trash followed by the classic decorative items of trash cans everywhere old coffee grounds and a banana peel my apologies to those who hoped for more but the worst i can do is show my unconcerned contempt
1743954 can anyone out there score me some consecrated communion wafers theres no way i can personally get them my local churches have stakes prepared for me im sure but if any of you would be willing to do what it takes to get me some or even one and mail it to me ill show you sacrilege gladly and with much fanfare i wont be tempted to hold it hostage no not even if i have a choice between returning the eucharist and watching bill donohue kick the pope in the s which would apparently be a more humane act than desecrating a goddamned cracker but will instead treat it with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse all photographed and presented here on the web i shall do so joyfully and with laughter in my heart
1743955 they pz myer supporters claim that once given to them by the priest the blessed sacrament is their property they can do it with as they please
1743956 if the u of minn prof simply destroyed a mere symbol or said disparaging things about catholicism or christ id say that he should be punished only in the forum of public opinion the consecrated host however is much more than a symbol of christ it is christ
1743957 hey if big names are doing it often right under the nose of the pope himself whats the big deal
1743958 were stunned that a man named chubby could even have inadvertently spawned an exercise craze
1743959 we can look at this from two different sides either the un isnt doing enough or the un is
1743960 it communicates to the employer that the person cares about what happens to the company
1743961 its like you become pregnant and your body becomes public property
1743962 according to most people i know i was born a workaholic
1743963 i enjoy doing what i do i prefer to do business 24 hours a day if i can
1743964 be sure you are getting enough sleep you can trade sleep for more work hours but chances are you wont work as well if you arent 100
1743965 recent research shows that a short nap can be a great way to re energize during the day without making it too difficult to sleep at night
1743966 i usually read on the elliptical or i just started learning hebrew and i practice saying the words and learning the tenses
1743967 some people devote more time to work to fill gaps of time find a hobby and spend more time doing something that interests you
1743968 i got a dog which gave me a really good and fun reason to leave the office on time at 6 00 every day and then go take a nice walk rather than staying later at the office or bringing too much work home
1743969 the boundary between work and home can be really blurry especially with technology which can be both a help and a hindrance
1743970 keep a notepad next to your bed in case you wake up and think of something being able to write it down right then may help you fall asleep more quickly so you dont stay up fretting that you wont remember in the morning
1743971 that makes it possible for gang members to see information like bank balances without having to log in to stolen accounts

1743976 im concerned about efforts that arent aimed at reducing poverty but zone it away and move it around
1743977 with results suggesting that rheumatoid arthritis is associated with periodontal disease it is easy to assume that an ra sufferer is perhaps unable to properly care for his or her teeth and gums due to the debilitating nature of the disease
1743978 however this study implies that there are other potential factors involved for instance both ra and gum disease are systemic inflammatory disorders which may explain the connection between the two inflammation is already thought to link periodontal disease with other conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes we look forward to future research that may reveal the biological mechanisms that link these two important diseases
1743979 it is critical that dental professionals and medical professionals work together when treating a patient living with rheumatoid arthritis this partnership will assure that both the oral and overall health of these patients is paramount
1743980 this study illustrates the impact flossing can have on oral health the twins experimental model is a powerful tool to help sort out genetic and environmental factors that often confound the interpretation of treatment studies this study demonstrates that flossing can have an important and favorable impact on an individual as compared to that of a non flossing individual with similar genetics and possibly similar habits
1743981 twins tend to share the same or similar environmental factors such as dietary habits health and life practices as well as genetics in this case the only difference was flossing and the outcome was significant flossing may significantly reduce the amount of bad bacteria in the mouth
1743982 as a practicing periodontist i am constantly telling my patients to clean between their teeth more using dental floss or interdental cleaners
1743983 patients tend to think that flossing cant possibly make that much of a difference but this study demonstrates that the addition of flossing to your dental hygiene routine can significantly reduce the amount of periodontal disease causing bacteria even after just two weeks
1743984 last years annual meeting was a huge success with over 6 000 attendees innovative and instructive educational sessions and an exciting interactive exhibit hall
1743985 we are looking forward to building on this success in seattle this year in addition to offering networking events with fellow colleagues and opportunities to learn about cutting edge research and technology in periodontology i hope this meeting also encourages continued communication among dental professionals about the importance of maintaining your patients periodontal health
1743986 it is advantageous for a dental professional to evaluate a patients various risk factors for periodontal disease
1743987 considering risk factors as part of the treatment planning process allows for proactive management of the patients oral health and can potentially reduce the need for more complex periodontal procedures in the future the aap statement hopes to compel more dental professionals to take a full inventory of their patients health especially any applicable risk factors when determining the best course of treatment
1743988 research has suggested that periodontal disease may affect overall systemic health
1743989 this study reinforces what much of the public already knows the importance of dairy in helping achieve a healthy lifestyle including a healthy mouth
1743990 by regularly consuming dairy products such as cheese and milk something many people do each day the risk of developing gum disease may decrease these findings are important since maintaining healthy gums is a critical component to maintaining a healthy body
1743991 since periodontal disease is prevalent in such a large number of adults we sought to investigate if the disease affects a persons smiling behavior
1743992 smiling plays a significant and essential role in overall well being previous findings suggest that smiling can affect social interactions self confidence and can influence how people perceive one another
1743993 it is already widely known that periodontal disease is connected to systemic health
1743994 these results help demonstrate that periodontal disease may affect more than just overall health it can also impact actual quality of life making caring for ones teeth and gums all the more important
1743995 although there have been many studies associating gum disease with heart disease what we have not known is exactly why this happens and under what circumstances
1743996 the findings of this new analysis of previously published studies suggest that the long term effect of chronic periodontitis such as extended bacterial exposure may be what ultimately leads to cardiovascular disease
1743997 while more research is needed to better understand the connection between periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease this study suggests the importance of taking of your teeth and gums and how that can help you take care of your heart
1743998 with the number of people with heart disease continuing to increase it is important to understand that simple activities like brushing and flossing twice a day and regular visits to your dental professional can help lower your risk of other health conditions
1743999 the dark side the inside story of how the war on terror turned into a war on american ideals
1744000 achievement lies less in bringing new revelations to light than in weaving into a comprehensive narrative a story revealed elsewhere in bits and pieces
1744001 under the guise of enhanced interrogation techniques it has succeeded in mayers words in making torture the official law of the land in all but name further it has done all these things as a direct result of policy decisions made at the highest levels of government
1744002 to dismiss these as wild anti american ravings will not do
1744003 above all the story mayer tells is one of fear and its exploitation
1744004 from mayer we learn that in george w bushs washington the decisions that matter are made in secret by a handful of presidential appointees committed to the proposition that nothing should inhibit the exercise of executive power the congress the judiciary the bureaucracy the interagency process all of these constitute impediments that threaten to constrain the president in a national security crisis constraint is intolerable much the same applies to the media and by extension to the american people the publics right to know extends no further than whatever the white house wishes to make known
1744005 so what if they cut corners the administrations last defenders argue while prissy lawyers insist on habeas corpus and court issued wiretap warrants the rest of us are being kept safe by the cheney posse
1744006 after 9 11 our government emphasized interrogation over due process ms
1744007 the biggest torture fueled wild goose chase of course is the war in iraq
1744008 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from former iraqi intelligence chief tahir jalil habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1744009 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book
1744010 i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
1744011 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1744012 we want this question to go away so were going to call it ridiculous
1744013 in late september tenet returned from a meeting at the white house with instructions for cia
1744014 to violate the statute an individual must have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering
1744015 based on the information you have provided us we believe that those carrying out these procedures would not have the specific intent to inflict severe physical pain or suffering
1744016 furthermore no specific intent to cause severe mental pain or suffering appears to be present prolonged mental harm is substantial mental harm of sustained duration e g harm lasting months or even years after the acts were inflicted upon the prisoner
1744017 lawyers for the bush administration told the cia in 2002 that its officers could legally use waterboarding and other harsh measures while interrogating al qaeda suspects as long as they acted in good faith and did not deliberately seek to inflict severe pain according to a justice department memo made public yesterday
1744018 with six months left in office mr bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice appear to be looking for new ways to reach out to the iranian people as the administration tries to bring a peaceful resolution to the impasse over irans nuclear program
1744019 on saturday william j burns the state departments third ranking official is to arrive in geneva to participate along with european union nations in talks with iran aimed at persuading it to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for economic and political incentives the talks are a first
1744020 my feeling is that the decision was more or less taken and the administrations problem was when and how to announce it the official said
1744021 condoleezza rice was george bushs handmaiden for the war in iraq but she is now emerging as the best hope for avoiding a military conflict between the united states and iran
1744022 the secretary of state who is one of the few people with the presidents ear has shown the door to vice president dick cheneys cabal of war hungry advisers
1744023 in public ms rice has been as bellicose as any neo con when it comes to iran calling dialogue with its leaders pointless and declaring for the sake of peace the world must not allow iran to have nuclear weapons
1744024 she had been the prime mover behind mr bushs disastrous policy of preventive wars and cheerleader of his expansive plans to reorganise the entire middle east and to export democracy but with the rumblings of war with iran growing steadily louder ms rice worked feverishly behind the scenes to stop sparks from flying in the drive by the us and israel to shut down irans nuclear programme
1744025 democrats said bates 93 page ruling vindicated their dogged efforts to check potential abuses under bush and tentatively set hearings for september they said they expected white house officials to appear then to answer questions about the controversy over the fired prosecutors which led to the resignation of bush confidant and former atty gen alberto r gonzales last year
1744026 bates left unresolved whether administration officials would be justified in refusing to answer specific questions under the doctrine of executive privilege
1744027 that question and an anticipated white house appeal means the controversy is likely to spill over into the next administration where it could raise novel legal questions about whether ex presidents have the power to assert executive privilege after they have left office
1744028 bates said he hoped that lawyers for the two branches would settle the dispute and avoid further litigation he scheduled a conference for aug 27 to discuss their progress
1744029 the practical significance of the opinion will depend chiefly on whether the investigations persist into the next congress and on how the new administration responds said peter m shane a professor at ohio state universitys law school
1744030 he said there might be interesting questions yet presented about the authority of an ex president to make even qualified executive privilege claims on behalf of his former aides but he said that in general it is up to the incumbent president to decide while in office what is in the best interests of the executive branch as an institution
1744031 a former president may still assert executive privilege but the claim necessarily has less force particularly when the sitting president does not support the claim of privilege
1744032 the house could take other actions to compel the testimony for example the judge said the house could order white house counsel harriet mierss arrest and detention in a cell in the capitol until she agreed to testify such actions were fairly common in the 19th century
1744033 argued that congress could have decided to withhold justice department appropriations or refused to pass judicial nominations
1744034 who participated in spirited arguments with both sides for nearly three hours summed up the courts predicament saying whether i rule for the executive branch or i rule for the legislative branch im going to disrupt the balance
1744035 the case with its fundamental issues of the separation of powers and the extent to which the executive branch may withhold information involves efforts by democrats on the committee to investigate whether the white house exercised improper political influence in the firing of several federal prosecutors the house has voted to hold in contempt harriet e miers the former white house counsel and joshua c bolten the white house chief of staff who have refused to provide documents and testimony about the dismissals of the united states attorneys
1744036 repeatedly challenged an administration lawyer to cite legal justification for the refusal of former white house counsel harriet miers and chief of staff joshua bolten to obey subpoenas to appear before the house judiciary committee
1744037 there is no case that supports the absolute immunity proposition that you have before the court bates told carl nichols the principal deputy associate attorney general cases cited by the government seem to support something less than an absolute immunity the judge said
1744038 late last year congress agreed to a request from president bush to fund a major escalation of covert operations against iran according to current and former military intelligence and congressional sources
1744039 the finding was focussed on undermining irans nuclear ambitions and trying to undermine the government through regime change a person familiar with its contents said and involved working with opposition groups and passing money
1744040 i do have some access into some of the thinking particularly in the vice presidents office
1744041 so they believe that their mission is to make sure that before they get out of office next year either iran is attacked or it stops its weapons program
1744042 military and civilian leaders in the pentagon share the white houses concern about irans nuclear ambitions but there is disagreement about whether a military strike is the right solution
1744043 a democratic senator told me that late last year in an off the record lunch meeting secretary of defense gates met with the democratic caucus in the senate
1744044 the potential for escalation became clear in early january when five iranian patrol boats believed to be under the command of the revolutionary guard made a series of aggressive moves toward three navy warships sailing through the strait of hormuz
1744045 the crisis was quickly defused by vice admiral kevin cosgriff the commander of u

1744069 we are investigating a burglary at an address in west wickham in the early hours of tuesday
1744070 the policing operation is designed primarily to deter people who may be intending to disrupt the event or to attack people going to and from the event
1744071 with something like this we are dealing with criminal intelligence
1744072 we also have to use professional judgment and my judgment was that we needed to run this operation to ensure people are safe
1744073 i think its a gross waste of local peoples money
1744074 the general public in the district are amazed about the work the police are putting into this

1744090 she is not getting married both headlines are complete fabrications
1744091 well yes i think it is i come from a moral background and i can see the power of the show and imagine my old school teachers cringing or my grandparents thinking oh my god when they see me say having sex on a barstool but you have to remember this is not a reality show its supposed to be pure entertainment i dont actually think people give enough credit to teenagers who watch the show
1744092 theyre not stupid and its not like were making an instruction manual telling them how to drink and do drugs or have sex were just laying out how it is my character is very conflicted and even in the episodes where hes having sex then dumping girls theres often regret you know there are repercussions to certain sorts of behavior that come full circle
1744093 i never actually said i disliked having my top off it was just that on that occasion it didnt make sense
1744094 nate was supposed to be waking up hungover on his buddys couch so why would he be in his boxer shorts i dont actually mind taking my clothes off most of the time its why i go to the gym
1744095 but right now i couldnt ask for more and i certainly never complain about it
1744096 i guess some people assume theres a seed of truth to it people think where theres smoke theres fire
1744097 i just dont even want to speculate on that its just one of those things that rolls off my back
1744098 theres not one seed of truth to it so itll just go away in the end
1744099 our goal was to produce a movie unlike anything else in animation
1744100 but we also had to stay true to star wars to honor everything that george lucas has created thats easier said than done and it took us a long time to figure out exactly how to develop the look style and feel of an animated star wars
1744101 george wanted the characters to live on their own separate from the recognizable actors who portrayed them in the previous films
1744102 to do that we really had to find the essence of the characters and to bring them to life in a way that wasnt just a reproduction of their live action counterparts we wanted to break free of any preconceived notions of what star wars should be
1744103 we loved the look of the micro series and when we began to see the maquettes that were licensed on its behalf it was a neat glimpse into what those designs might look like in a 3 d space
1744104 but we wanted to take it much further to do something dramatically different with star wars and animation working in computer graphics we incorporated those stylistic aspects into a world with an entirely different depth physicality and scope from there it really began to grow and evolve into whats on screen
1744105 ive always been a big fan of the anime look japanese animation and manga tend to push the envelope with really innovative composition so we followed that lead
1744106 that said animation is a vast field and its too filled with possibilities for us to limit ourselves to one style we also took inspiration from gerry andersons thunderbirds which was shot in the 1960s using marionettes so we really took these disparate influences and fused them into something pretty unique
1744107 in star wars the clone wars weve got new characters new planets new vehicles new battles and a new story and its animated with a completely new style
1744108 it really is star wars like youve never seen it before in every way possible

1744124 the most ridiculous part is that the government banned all crowds from gathering even various training programs have been stopped the reason is to prevent terrorists from making trouble in crowded gathering places the national television course university entrance exam has also been cancelled all testing papers that were already in place at the testing locations have been sealed and have to be guarded day and night
1744125 we are very excited to be releasing the pc version of grand theft auto iv

1744130 we need more support in different areas and in different clusters one of the main needs in the agricultural sector

1744305 through our partnership with famy care we have met another longstanding commitment by expanding our portfolio to create a womens health care franchise for mylan
1744306 we anticipate filing andas as early as the next few months and beginning to commercialize them in 2010
1744307 after working on this initiative for some time we have found an outstanding partner in famy care the worlds largest manufacturer of oral contraceptives famy care is a well established and well respected global company deeply committed to quality and customer satisfaction were delighted to have completed this agreement with an organization considered a world leader in generic contraceptives and we look forward to bringing these oc medicines to u s customers as quickly as possible
1744308 we discussed aligning famy care with a number of highly qualified companies but mylan clearly became the partner of choice
1744309 we based our decision on mylans strong presence in the united states expanded global commercial footprint and its high quality and customer service standards mylan is well positioned to help us achieve the vast potential we see in our diverse womens health care product portfolio

1744313 i am extremely excited about the ability to move millennium in the commercialization of its product lines and leverage and enhance its intellectual assets i feel strongly that we must shed our past and move quickly to establish beachheads in the lucrative channels we have initiated while concurrently developing similar opportunities in related platforms this development and execution of our targeted nutritional supplements both powdered and ready to drink will lead the transformation of millennium from a small start up company with a promising technology to a global enterprise with increasing value to our shareholders

1744378 from the time i was about 14 ive been doing the bar scene
1744379 i was the frontman of a funk rock cover band in high school and we used to play every other weekend
1744380 i had become so discontent with making money through playing other peoples songs and dealing with the egos that i wanted to push things in different directions
1744381 i didnt want to play like that anymore i wanted to be my own performer
1744382 i may sound like i am a student of rock n roll but really im just a beginner
1744383 i went from a young kid who listened to grunge and 90s pop to an acoustic loving pansy performer
1744384 whirlwind of excitement and then all of a sudden it ended nothing came of the show nothing at all i thought to myself is that it
1744385 im afraid of terminal musicality and the prospect that i will be a a hyped up one hit wonder like vampire weekend or b out of the game forever because i refuse to play what people think is popular
1744386 i can assure the community that victoria police will investigate the matter
1744387 no matter who you are involved in these incidents we will pursue it appropriately and correctly and put people before the court who deserve to be
1744388 as part of the investigation victoria police has looked at the issue of who was driving the vehicle and is satisfied the appropriate person has been issued with a penalty notice
1744389 i think its sad to see that people who supported them have clearly been let down
1744390 hard to tell the model but its a toyota cressida
1744391 this is a great job and i just love it
1744392 here just look at this the key is still in the lock its amazing how people who think they are pulling swifties can be so absolutely dumb
1744393 joy riders dont generally have access to keys so if the car is genuinely stolen we expect to see the lock missing or broken
1744394 that car the cressida the key wasnt the original one it had been cut
1744395 if the owner filed a claim form and swore that all the keys were accounted for then he could have a problem a very big problem
1744396 ive placed criteria on that and it is important to recognise the water needs to be there
1744397 theres no steering away from that the water has to be there and theres numerous criteria in the way in which the water can be taken
1744398 i know this is a very sensitive project to many landholders but i would call upon those affected to acknowledge the project will go ahead and that they should openly work with the proponent and i have set down conditions through the environmental management plan
1744399 obviously there is no water therefore why are we having all our taxes spent on a pipeline 70km over the great divide to melbourne which will carry no water
1744400 we will not stop fighting this project because environmentally it is so very wrong
1744401 farmers although they often get bagged are the best environmentalists they look after their properties and their land because that is their living and their income
1744402 its dumb its dangerous its causing a lot of division north of the divide
1744403 and here weve gone through this claytons process with justin madden of all people ticking off on this project impact assessment when weve all known was going to press ahead
1744404 we really dont know what to expect to find when we pull these cars out of the river
1744405 there could be weapons there could be evidence of any sort there we just have to wait and see
1744406 we will know where these cars were originally stolen from
1744407 weve got a team of detectives and forensic people who will actually look at the vehicles and collect what evidence they can and then well go about investigating the crime
1744408 we know there are many many in our victorian waterways today is about recovering those 120 and going about the investigation to see if we can actually identify who actually committed the crimes
1744409 ratepayers and their local councils may face unexpected multi million dollar bills from road pavement damage if longer and heavier b triples are allowed on numerous arterial and local roads

1744417 this resulted in him being publicly named and having his privacy and rights trampled on
1744418 this is a timely reminder to everyone that dna evidence is not always infallible and cases must be proved in a court of law the existence of dna evidence should not lead to a presumption of guilt

1744426 i wonder what happened to the dna i thought they had the dna down to a fine art i dont know where we go from here
1744427 were not giving up weve waited 24 years for this its just a hiccup i think thats all it is

1744446 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad
1744447 i actually have three responses it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states

1744450 no way would she still be with anyone if marriage wasnt a real option
1744451 show him shes not the self centered girl he had made her out to be
1744452 holy crap its terrible im talking godawful even with the offensive factor set aside its in my top 10 worst comedy scripts ever read out of probably over a thousand
1744453 invariably in tuckers stories someone gets pissed off and says his jokes arent funny and if that someone is a woman shes dismissed as ugly and or fat and therefore too bitter and angry to get the joke while if that someone is a man hes dismissed as being a meathead and therefore not cool or smart enough to get the joke if you are confused by this last let me clear it up for you tucker max is unaware that he is the definition of a hazey rapey fratty meathead
1744454 it seems like the height of comedy to me when failed writers cast aspersions on successful writing i guess i would be pissed off too if i tried so hard for so long with nothing to show for it and then some big dumb rapey fratty came out of nowhere to spend three years on the best seller list and got a movie made of course if that happened to me i would stop and reevaluate what i was doing wrong and he was doing right but thats just me and im not very smart just successful

1744458 maybe id have thought this buddy action comedy was funnier and more exciting if i were as baked as its two heroes
1744459 still maybe all of this is more fun if youre under the influence of the same substance our stoner heroes are
1744460 some choice lines aside too much of the humor is predicated on the notion that watching others get high is inherently funny unless the viewer happens to be in a similar state its not
1744461 i was stone cold sober when i saw this movie and considering the subject at hand that may not necessarily be the intended audience
1744462 the movie is a chaotic mess but munchies in hand go with it
1744463 this is the kind of film that relies on its audience to find four letter words funny
1744464 parts of it are really funny although im sure it would be funnier if i had been stoned rather than periodically bored
1744465 these months have been hard for me and i just want others to talk about me in terms of my work im a valencia cf player and all i need is peace and absolute normality to train properly my intention is concentrating on the game and giving my best performances

1744528 there is no single metric which clearly defines a product winner in the security and networking applications space this is why at sensory we have been developing technology to cover small packet performance latency throughput connections per second supported rule count and pcre compatibility

1744619 you can tune a piano but you cant tuna fish
1744620 if we can develop bluefin tuna through marine aquaculture this will definitely ease pressures on bluefin tuna in the wild
1744621 i expect it hormone implantation to be increasingly used and expanded for bluefin tuna as the hatchery technologies for this species are developed
1744622 the implants result in spawning and production of juveniles that will be used both for aquaculture for food consumption as well as potentially to be released to the wild for stock enhancement
1744623 weve seen all of the problems associated with farm raising salmon and theres no question in my mind that the problems with bluefin tuna are just as large
1744624 those fish are no longer available to other predators seabirds marine mammals whales
1744625 were essentially robbing the ocean ecosystem of key food items for other species and diverting them to bluefin tuna
1744626 i believe there are big opportunities and i think sustainable aquaculture is the future so that we can take the pressure off wild stocks
1744627 but note the word sustainable that your output into the worlds oceans is clean that youre not taking too much from the sea to feed tunas in the land based facilities or pens many question whether it can be done
1744628 if government can adequately put in place measures to address these constraints then we could see a gradual transformation of the sector

1744691 to say america is unaware to the consequences of this conflict is incorrect and your criticism of them for going about their lives and the choices they make astonishes me
1744692 alot of people are really uncomfortable trying to figure out how to handle you how to talk about what must be a considerable part of your life which they cannot relate to in person
1744693 my only issues are petty ones and i think a critique based on petty points is a testament to the success of the authors mission theres no way hollywood can portray a tour in seven episodes on tv but overall in my humble pog opinion generation kill does a pretty damn good job of it
1744694 imagine the morale bashing a draftee would bring no thank you
1744695 we know that antimitotic drugs block the final stage of the cell division process mitosis
1744696 in essence it turns out that when cells are exposed to these drugs they arrest in mitosis then a race starts between two competing cellular signaling networks one network is trying to kill the cell the other is trying to cause the cell to exit mitosis and thus allow the cell to survive the factors influencing the race not only vary from cell line to cell line but also within cells from the same line explaining why there is so much complexity
1744697 what we want to do now is figure out how we can help the cell death pathway win the race more often

1744709 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1744710 there really isnt anything out there on the horizon thats going to change the economic landscape in a meaningful way
1744711 consumers are likely to be very concerned about the economy come election day
1744712 when the economy is bad it tends to favor the party thats out of power
1744713 historically when consumers are concerned about inflation they vote republican and when they are worried about employment thats when they tend to vote democratic

1744723 one of the most firmly established facts in dietetics research is that almost everyone underreports their food intake badly sometimes by as much as 50 i m not saying everyone lies they just forget or don t know in fact this underreporting of calorie intake is such a huge problem that it makes obesity research very difficult to do and conclusions difficult to draw from free living studies
1744724 help tom im eating 900 calories a day and i still cant lose weight

1744726 weight loss with a low carbohydrate mediterranean or low fat diet was published in
1744727 low carb and low fat diets face off the never ending diet wars low carb beats low fat in diet duel atkins diet is safe and far more effective than a low fat one study says unrestricted low carb diet wins hands down some of these headlines are hilarious i wonder if any of these reporters actually read the whole study geez is it too much trouble to read 13 pages before you write a story that will be read by millions of already confused people suffering the pain and frustration of obesity here s a quick look at the study design the low fat restricted calorie diet was based on american heart association guidelines calorie intake was set at 1500 for women 1800 a day for men with 30 of calories from fat and only 10 from saturated fat participants were instructed to eat low fat grains vegetables fruits and legumes and to limit their consumption of additional fats sweets and high fat snacks the mediterranean diet group was placed on a moderate fat restricted calorie program rich in vegetables and low in red meat with poultry and fish replacing beef and lamb energy intake was restricted to 1500 calories per day for women and 1800 calories per day for men with a goal of no more than 35 of calorie from fat added fat came mostly from nuts and olive oil the low carb diet was a non restricted calorie plan aimed at providing 20 grams of carbs per day for the 2 month induction phase with a gradual increase to 120 grams per day to maintain the weight loss intakes of total calories protein and fat were not limited however the participants were counseled to choose vegetarian sources of protein more on that bizarre twist shortly the study subjects were mostly male 86 overweight bmi 31 and middle age mean age 52 here were the study results there were some health improvements in cholesterol blood pressure and other parameters in the mediterranean and low carb group that bested the high carb group that was the focus of many articles and discussions that appeared on the net this week however i d like to focus on the weight loss aspect as i m not a medical doctor and fat loss is the primary subject matter of this website all three groups lost weight the low carb group lost 5 5 kilos the mediterranean group lost 4 6 kilos and the low fat group lost 3 3 kilograms in two years whoopee my conclusion would be that the results were similar and that none of the diets worked very well over the long term amanda gardner of the us news and world report health day was one of the few reporters who got it right diet plans produce similar results study finds mediterranean and low carb diets work just as well as low fat ones tara parker pope of the new york times also came close with her headline long term diet study suggests success is hard to come by in a tightly controlled experiment obese people lost an average of just 6 to 10 pounds over two years
1744728 this trial suggests a model that might be applied more broadly in the workplace using the employer as a health coach could be an effective way to improve health the model of group intervention with the use of dietary group sessions spousal support food labels and monthly weighing in the workplace within the framework of a health promotion campaign might yield weight reduction and long term health benefits
1744729 this study was conducted over 2 years so all the there s no long term study people really need to start listening up
1744730 everyones different so there are no hard and fast rules
1744731 your genetics wont allow you to get any bigger or stronger
1744732 i received an email today from a friend who asked one of the researchers about the reference to plant based vegetable fats and proteins dr shai assured him that the low carbohydrate group was
1744733 for example a plate could include fish or fried not bread coated chicken or red meat broccoli and mushrooms coated with eggs roasted eggplants vegetable salad peppers cucumber green leaves not lettuce with olive oil dressing
1744734 the so called calorie theory has been a millstone around the necks of dieters and a miserable malign influence on their efforts to lose
1744735 its not that calories don t count its just that you can in fact sneak them out of your body unused dissipated as heat
1744736 on a low carbohydrate diet there are metabolic advantages that will allow you to eat as many ore more calories as you were eating before starting the diet and still begin losing pounds and inches
1744737 3 the rate of adherence to a study diet was 95 4 at 1 year and 84 6 at 2 years
1744738 by the way the adherence rate for the low carb group was the lowest 90 4 in low fat group 85 3 in the mediterranean group 78 in the low carb group
1744739 it is ok to have the intention of doing something but we are not always able to do things we want to do the reality is different from what can be its ok to have the intention
1744740 why cant i be like models im young strong and motivated
1744741 how i got ripped abs for the very first time
1744742 i went in the subway sandwich shop and ordered two sandwiches and i paid almost 12 for the sandwich i did not get the sandwich made the way to be made the way i wanted to
1744743 he actually called 911 to tell us that he needed our assistance because his sandwich was improperly made
1744744 they locked the door on me they got the sandwiches i paid for inside the store im not leaving here until i got what i paid for im not going to sit and pay 12 or 10 for some sandwiches and not get what i paid for
1744745 then he calls a third time and wanted to know where police were once we arrived he was totally irrational
1744746 he was obviously having a bad day and he was going to take it out on anybody he could and he verbally took it out on the restaurant and he took it out on us when we went to assist him

1744748 good calories bad calories has much useful information and is well worth reading gary taubess tenets related to obesity can be summarized in four statements i he believes that you can gain weight and become obese without a positive energy balance ii he also believes that dietary fat is unimportant for the development of obesity iii carbohydrate in his view is what produces obesity iv insulin secreted by the carbohydrate is the problem in obesity however some of the conclusions that the author reaches are not consistent with current concepts about obesity there are many kinds of obesity and only some depend on diet composition two dietary manipulations produce obesity in susceptible people eating a high fat diet and drinking sugar or high fructose corn syrups weetened beverages insulin is necessary but not sufficient in the diet dependent obesities when diet is important it may be the combination of fat and fructose the deadly duo that is most important regardless of diet it is a positive energy balance over months to years that is the sine qua non for obesity obese people clearly eat more than do lean ones and food intake records are notoriously unreliable as documented by use of doubly labelled water underreporting of food intake is greater in obese than in normal weight people and is worse for fat than for other macronutrient groups accepting the concept that obesity results from a positive energy balance does not tell us why energy balance is positive this depends on a variety of environmental factors interacting with the genetic susceptibility of certain individuals weight loss is related to adherence to the diet not to its macronutrient composition
1744749 weight loss is related to adherence to the diet not to its macronutrient composition
1744750 weve never been able to demonstrate that you can lose weight exercising
1744751 weve never been able to demonstrate that you can lose weight exercising
1744752 i he believes that you can gain weight and become obese without a positive energy balance
1744753 ii he also believes that dietary fat is unimportant for the development of obesity
1744754 iv insulin secreted by the carbohydrate is the problem in obesity
1744755 i believe that low carb diets are most effective for fat loss and you also need a calorie deficit
1744756 do what you always did get what you always got
1744757 ok good as long as youre not injured lets get on with it next set
1744758 most people are running around their whole lives with their umbilical cords in their hands and theyre looking for some place to plug it back in
1744759 i grew so much from that period where everything was great

1744761 this man was directly responsible for saving my life if you have never heard of him his name is tom venuto
1744762 because all the training i do i can eat all i want and not gain weight
1744763 i realize i m off on a slight tangent but arkady s success really made me think the stereotypes of runners being skinny or overtrained or whatever are every bit as untrue and unfair as stereotypes of bodybuilders and weight lifters being dumb muscle heads that are all on roids and by the way when endurance athletes fuel themselves with proper nutrition and continue with weight training as arkady has done they can develop bodies that are surprisingly muscular as well as lean
1744764 ik probeerde hem helemaal niet na te doen daarvoor kijk ik veel te veel tegen hem op ik zou balen als hij zich gekwetst zou voelen want dat was niet mijn bedoeling
1744765 steady state cardio is really proven 5 x more effective than hiit
1744766 nice article but when i saw the heading i was bout to kill myself because i changed from steadys tate to hiit a few months ago due to a study i saw
1744767 it appeared reasonable to adjust for changes in subcutaenous fat to compare for energy cost
1744768 the earlier research optimism regarding an important role for the epoc in weight loss is generally unfounded this is further reinforced by acknowledging that
1744769 obama didnt even tell harvard law school that he was black on his application
1744770 his work was with those who didnt have much and they were black hispanic and white
1744771 he never had much inclination to use affirmative action as a tool then he wanted to level the playing field by providing early childhood education programs access to good schools
1744772 he was clearly unambiguously in favor of affirmative action as a policy matter but he recognized some of the ambiguities and the nuances in the argument that the most passionate affirmative action supporters often did not
1744773 i honestly honestly believed that yale thought that having a kid who came from working people in the south who had grown up through segregation that this kid who had prospered who had done well every single place hed ever been whether an all white school all black school hes always done well he will do well here and it will benefit both him and yale
1744774 thats what i thought well that isnt what it was converted to
1744775 it was converted to well youre here because youre black
1744776 you know i was in debt i needed a job and i couldnt get a job
1744777 i couldnt get a job and i just saw the discounting of my degree happen before my eyes
1744778 that degree meant one thing for whites and another thing for blacks it was discounted
1744779 you write in the book that your yale degree was worth 15 cents
1744780 well you know steve i have still a 15 cents sticker on the frame that my law degree is in
1744781 its tainted so i just leave it in the basement
1744782 obama didnt even tell harvard law school that he was black on his application
1744783 tell us about what makes you unique or tell us about overcoming adversity
1744784 why are people still confused about fat burning cardio in the first place when the solution is drop dead simple common sense and right in front of our noses
1744785 if i could help remove the source of the confusion then regardless of which cardio program you choose every decision and action that emerges from your new understanding would be more productive right
1744786 the higher your intensity the more carbs you burn during the workout the lower your intensity the more fat you burn during the workout and thats the problem you should be focusing on total calories and total fat burned during the workout and all day long not just what type or percentage of fuel you are burning during the workout
1744787 but if the aim is to burn fat surely the type of fuel being burned does make a difference
1744788 if youre mainly burning carbs and eating more to fuel those carb burning workouts wheres the fat loss
1744789 it seems to me that the solution is even simpler than the article suggests exercising at the hardest rate that you can maintain for 30 minutes to an hour is going to be the best fat burner every time
1744790 when you sit with a nice girl for two hours it seems like two minutes when you sit on a hot stove for two minutes it seems like two hours thats relativity
1744791 the factor that probably has the greatest impact on energy expenditure is volume of work which is a function of intensity and duration of exercise
1744792 maybe you did intervals but they werent high intensity intervals
1744793 tarantino had planned to meet with leonardo dicaprio for the role of ss col hans landa only to decide that the role should be played by a german actor
1744794 bruce knows better than anyone that broadcasting from an olympiad can be an endurance event in itself
1744795 with the distance and multiple time zones to get to beijing plus the long hours and multiple deadlines bruce has decided to look after his health first and make sure he rests and recuperates
1744796 its much better to hold games in a small capacity venue to increase the noise of supporters
1744797 we will be putting in a small dispensary beside the physicians office it would depend on when the physician is going to arrive
1744798 it was all predicted 10 years ago that the pharmacist shortage would affect us big time and it has
1744799 if you start adding up the pharmacists theres less of us now than five years ago and theres more stores
1744800 yes it probably will cut into it business somewhat but its also a service to the community it would be more designed for the patients in georgetown
1744801 it is important that this great nation opens itself to the gospel
1744802 shows us the path of life and is also a sign for the future of the church
1744803 he is a saint of great relevance we know that china is becoming more and more important in political and economic life and also in the life of ideas
1744804 the faith does not mean an alienation from any culture for any people because all cultures await christ and are not destroyed by the lord in fact they reach their maturity
1744805 i saw the dark cars stop right out front the pope and his brother got out and went toward the tomb
1744806 he went through a process of learning about and appreciating chinese culture
1744807 it is important that this great nation opens itself to the gospel
1744808 everything is ready basically and the final issue is security
1744809 all parishes must report to the diocese about the situation every evening
1744810 there is no particular restriction on what we must not say
1744811 talk about positive aspects of the church and the country but that they must honestly answer visitors questions
1744812 one person died on the spot while another one was seriously injured
1744813 the army had tried to persuade the protestors to vacate the highway in the curfew bound area

1744893 the state of texas will work diligently to defend the law and uphold the district court s decision which ruled that texas moment of silence statute is entirely constitutional
1744894 nothing in the establishment clause forbids moments of silence in public schools

1744937 this week were on fire for god gods doing incredible things last month or the month before we were at youth camp god impacted our lives but what about in between were you still led by fire or were you led back to sin
1744938 when the tough times come too often its hard for us to live out the commitment of being led by fire
1744939 god wants more than just a sunday morning in youth service commitment
1744940 theres more to the commitment of following jesus than just asking for forgiveness
1744941 making the commitment to follow him well thats easy but living the commitment thats where the work comes in
1744942 god wants you to be led by fire all of your life
1744943 god is raising up a generation of underdogs to be champions for christ and this is our opportunity to be a part of his plan for each of their lives this is our chance to challenge students and leaders to be led by fire
1744944 traditional church outreaches are not always the most effective in today s youth culture
1744945 the training and curriculum provided by mega sports will greatly benefit the city of charlotte while also giving our students the experience and confidence to bring similar relevant outreaches back home to their local communities

1744948 what brought me to the point of filing this lawsuit was the ill advised attempts by certain legislators to prevent the filing of certain lawsuits
1744949 widespread death destruction and terrorization of millions upon millions of the earths inhabitants
1744950 despite my most sincere zealous efforts i could not find a location to serve the defendant
1744951 despite my most sincere zealous efforts i could not find a location to serve the defendant
1744952 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
1744953 cause i mean this more than words can ever say
1744954 eighteen young people and older people alike were arrested on a street corner just for holding these graphic pictures of aborted babies
1744955 these christians were standing right on the public sidewalk which the supreme court has said over and over again is the place to express our deeply held religious and political beliefs looks like theyre going to be charged with disorderly conduct of all things when they werent even told what they were being arrested for
1744956 they were barely even warned this is the sort of thing youd expect in beijing china not in maryland
1744957 i find it amusing how for years the liberals complained it would be the conservatives who would eventually threaten our free speech rights when in reality that had been their plan all along this is merely another example of their plan coming to fruition
1744958 this is the only thing standing in the way of states being forced to recognize these out of state counterfeit homosexual so called marriages and for her to just quickly say yes that she wants to repeal that is just shockingly inappropriate
1744959 you have people like barack obama who say they do not support same sex marriage and yet all their actions especially obamas call for the full repeal of doma do nothing but promote so called homosexual marriage being spread across the united states
1744960 all their actions facilitate the spread of same sex marriage even as they deny that theyre supporting same sex marriage
1744961 i think that the gay movement has much influence the presidential candidates fear crossing them their influence has penetrated into american institutions i think that the republicans should realize that the gay voting power is still small the gay community has been at home with the democratic party and i think that it would be a mistake for the republican party to try and court this group in doing so they will alienate a much larger voting bloc i think that the democrats are committed to the gay community because they have been a firm voting bloc to them i think democrats will try to meet the gay movement demands whether they be right or whether they be wrong as long as america has christian influence she has hope without christian influence tribulation will set in on america sin needs to be covered and not flaunted
1744962 the church should be the one that decides what to allow
1744963 mccain voted for doma two thirds of the states have to ratify a federal amendment to the usconstitution easier to vote out the 276 nodrill democrats and dimwits can baldwin keyes paul supporters simply tell the whole truth mccain told ellen degeneris he opposes lesbian marriage and adoption baldwin and paul opposed the war in iraq respectfully john mcintyre
1744964 god has already said what is right and what is wrong we society dont think it applies to us the will of god cant apply to mankind because he doesnt recognize his creator and thats due to the sin adam and eve brought into the world if previous generations had passed down the commandments of god we wont be in the situation were in all sin is wrong in the eyes of god does a six year old tell his her parents what the rules are in their household of course not god gave his commandments to israel but they ignored them we are doing the same thing today as they did in biblical days rebellion is rebellion god established marriage between one man and one woman in the garden of eden we cant do right until we know were doing wrong
1744965 unfortunately mccain has vowed he is against a federal marriage ammendment due to his log cabin and lbgt ties we must support chuck baldwin
1744966 is anyone really surprised by this admission i am getting to the point to where i hope obama wins seriously then maybe then these ignorant people will see just what the democrats are doing to this once great nation
1744967 this is becoming more and more common and unfortunately because of the international elements involved these can be very difficult and very time consuming to investigate

1744994 the satellite integration is almost complete and we would be entering the thermovac in about a weeks time it takes about 45 50 days for the launch after thermovac after which we would declare the date the earliest is october

1744996 the payloads have been integrated at the satellite centre in bangalore you can see the full spacecraft there
1744997 it is going with good speed soon the process will be completed

1745003 the question whether there is mutuality of obligation is not the complete test for determination whether a contract of service exists i would have thought that the question of mutuality of obligation goes to the question whether there was a contract at all rather than what kind of contract there was if a contract existed
1745004 lack of mutuality of obligation before and after the completion of assignments does not mean that a person must be a casual worker and cannot in law be an employee
1745005 lets sweep the bush era under the carpet and move forward got to keep our eyes on the future
1745006 it seems to us that in every week where the claimant worked as an employee for however long that week must count under s212 1 his relationship is then governed by a contract of employment the subsection could not be clearer
1745007 it would be a curious result if as a consequence of taking holiday under the working time regulations the employee was destroying the rights which he would otherwise have had
1745008 once a days work was offered and accepted by the claimant then for that day a contract of service came into existence

1745053 collaborative research project exploring the potential for user generated descriptions of the subjects of works of art
1745054 together working within steve we hope to learn more about how to improve access to museum collections weve realized that what people remember about a work of art often isnt described in museum collections documentation and are aware that the vocabulary of museum professionals curators and registrars isnt always that of the general public we want to explore user contributed terminology collected on the web as a way to address these gaps user created descriptions could provide museums with missing subject based information for their collections databases and make our on line resources more useful

1745085 the average lifetime construction volume of the chinese architect in housing alone is approximately three dozens thirty story high rise buildings there is one tenth the number of architects in china than in the united states designing five times the projects volume in one fifth the time earning one tenth the design fee this implies an efficiency of 2500 times that of an american architect

1745089 unnecessary and excessive use of force including lethal force arbitrary detentions and intimidation
1745090 authorities launched a major military build up in the area with thousands of military troops special para military forces and other security reinforcements being sent in to put down the protesters
1745091 concocted and premeditated with no inkling of a truth in it
1745092 events in lhasa march 2 10 1989 tells vividly how the communist party of china orchestrated riots in lhasa in order to violently suppress the tibetans
1745093 on the dawn of march 5 the armed police in tibet received the action order from the chief commander of armed police headquarter mr li lianxiu that the special squad should immediately assign 300 members to be disguised as ordinary citizens and tibetan monks entering the eight corner street and other riot spots in lhasa to support plain clothes police to complete the task burn the scripture pagoda at the northeast of dazhao temple smash the rice store in the business district and incite citizens to rob rice and food attack the tibet gansu trading company encourage people to rob store products but only at the permitted locations
1745094 the violent unrest in lhasa the week before last was carefully planned in order to discredit the dalai lama and to justify further suppression
1745095 sources at british spy agency confirm tibetan claims of staged violence
1745096 the images they downloaded from the satellites provided confirmation the chinese used agent provocateurs to start riots which gave the pla the excuse to move on lhasa to kill and wound tibetans what the beijing regime had not expected was how the riots would spread not only across tar but also to sichuan qinghai and gansu provinces turning a large area of western china into a battle zone
1745097 it is learnt that the protests inside china as well as abroad are being sponsored and directed by the ministry of public security which is chinas internal intelligence and security agency
1745098 thousands of chinese security forces raided the monastery and forced stage and videotaped various scenes of the kirti monastery monks in their rooms to falsely indict them of involving in violence and riots etc
1745099 i am worried that the ccp is creating false evidence to try to show that his holiness the dalai lama is the mastermind behind the protests in tibet the security forces forced us to act out these scenes against our will with guns pointed at us i appeal to the people of the world do not be persuaded by these fake videos
1745100 to let the outside world know that china does not only just have one voice
1745101 the chinese authorities have broken their promise to improve the countrys human rights situation and betrayed the core values of the olympics the report proclaimed that the chinese authorities have tarnished the olympic legacy
1745102 there is the strong possibility that due to the increased public expression of chinese nationalism associated with the olympics the continued evolution of domestic freedoms may be temporarily halted
1745103 since the games were awarded to beijing in 2001 in fact not only have media restrictions not gotten better theyve gotten worse
1745104 throughout its 80 plus years everything the ccp has touched has been marred with lies wars famine tyranny massacre and terror
1745105 in the case of tibet the chinese authorities are stoking ethnic tension in five areas agent provocateurs have infiltrated the ranks of tibetan protestors and indulged in violence to create deep rifts between tibetans and chinese the authorities relentless demonization of his holiness the dalai lama is hurting tibetan sentiments chinas brutal crackdown on the tibetans is sowing the seeds of complete distrust in the authorities the chinese governments inflammatory use of the media and biased reporting is creating more misunderstanding amongst the chinese people the chinese governments active encouragement of overseas chinese students association to counter pro tibet protests with protests of their own is contributing to mutual suspicion

1745110 the first sentence that immigrants learned in henry fords english classes was i want to be a good american and today what is tyson doing its giving all workers muslim and non muslim workers an islamic holiday off and replacing labor day
1745111 tanzania and mozambique actually offered to take these people but they needed the united states and the u n to provide funding for resettlement
1745112 instead the state department said no were just going to bring them into the united states its insane
1745113 why are you trying to turn this into a controversy being muslim has nothing to do with being a good american they also arent replacing a christian holiday with the end of ramadan they just took a vote and decided that they preferred to take away labor day in america all religions were meant to coexist peacefully you will always be allowed to practice christianity and you are no better in the eyes of the government than followers of islam or any other religion just be happy you have the right to practice freely and stop trying to keep others from practicing their religions freely they arent hurting anybody
1745114 tyson should be forced out of business in the u s let them produce and sell their old tired chickens in the middle east there they can have all the islamic holidays they want
1745115 they put barricades out in the plaza and if mr borden or one of his friends even goes within those barricades whether or not theyre preaching or doing anything the security guards will immediately come and tell him that if he does not leave he will be arrested
1745116 we all have rights as citizens to go into the public square in our city in our town and express our views

1745123 she did not testify to conyers in a private interview where do you people get this stuff the hearing was in the form of a deposition to majority and minority counsel three each she was questioned for four hours sworn to tell the truth and there were no restrictions on inquiry
1745124 patriotism in my view does not mean unquestioning acceptance of whatever the government does to go along with whatever your government does is not a characteristic of democracy i remember in my own early education we were taught that it was a sign of a totalitarian state of a dictatorship when people did not question what their government did if you live in a democratic state it means you have the right to criticize your governments policies

1745158 all the policy reasons in the world cannot justify reading a substantive portion out of a statute
1745159 its on the fringes of the first amendment but there is some protection
1745160 however this case doesnt seem to fit the bill because this was a minor child and a minor child in a nude performance is not protected
1745161 thats really stretching it it was a bar it was a minor child that got up spontaneously to do a nude dance that is not protected
1745162 this is a tragic situation because a minor was involved
1745163 the judge needs to be disbarred and some arrests need to be made here
1745164 the judge needs to be impeached club needs to be charged with child abuse and contributing to the delinquency of a minor and if she had anything to drink serving alcohol to a minor then pull their business license this is abominable

1745175 the weekly contribution the distribution to the poor saints we contend is a part of the religion of jesus christ
1745176 that every christian congregation should follow the examples of those which were set in order by the apostles is i trust a proposition which few of those who love the founder of the christian institution will question and that the apostles did give orders to the congregations in galatia and to the corinthians to make a weekly contribution for the poor saints is a matter that cannot be disputed

1745202 pastiche is like a parody the imitation of a peculiar or unique style the wearing of a stylistic mask speech in a dead language but it is a neutral practice of such mimicry without paroys ulterior motive without the satirical impulse without laughter without that still latent feeling that there exists something normal compared to which is being imitated is rather comic
1745203 what do i want to be who am i is this really me etc
1745204 star wars reinvents this experience in the form of a pastiche that is there is no longer any point to a parody of such serials since they are long extinct it is a complex object in which on some first level children and adolescents can take the adventures straight while the adult public is able to gratify a deeper and more properly nostalgic desire to return to the older period and to live its strange old aesthetic artifcats through once again

1745208 g lens financial resources were detailed in the public prosecutors arguments which claimed that saudi arabia iran the turkish government and the central intelligence agency or cia were behind the g len movement it stated that some businessmen in ankara donated 10 to 70 percent of their annual income to the movement and that it corresponded to 20 000 to 300 000 per year per person it added that one businessman in istanbul donated 4 5 million each year and that young people graduating from g lens schools donated between 2 000 and 5 000 each year

1745263 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
1745264 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
1745265 pakistans enemy number one and the mastermind of almost every suicide operation against the pakistan army and the isi since june 2006 the newspaper added
1745266 the united states military has the capacity to direct a missile to a precise location at very short notice as it has done close to 20 times in the last few years to hit al qaeda targets inside pakistan
1745267 have long been intrigued by the presence of highly encrypted communications gear with mehsud this communication gear enables him to collect real time information on pakistani troop movements from an unidentified foreign source without being intercepted by pakistani intelligence
1745268 pakistani military leaders rubbished the american information and evidence on the kabul bombing but provided some rationale for keeping a window open with haqqani just as the british government had decided to open talks with some taliban leaders in southern afghanistan last year
1745269 well that may all be true but we have to be realistic and do whats possible

1745276 leer libros no es bueno porque s lo m s importante es que la lectura es capaz de crear vida interior no se trata s lo de obtener altos puntajes en la psu o mejorar el lenguaje sino de lograr un cambio definitivo que permita enfrentar dificultades planear estrategias para solucionar problemas y entender las distintas personalidades culturas y razas un ni o que lee es un ser universal
1745277 a los ni os hay que leerles desde que son concebidos y seguir hasta la muerte los adultos debemos ser gu as igual que un buen gu a tur stico aconsejar ir conociendo los gustos darles tiempo para que se deleiten con el paisaje contar detalles o an cdotas
1745278 es fundamental que los ni os est n solos que no siempre est n entretenidos la literatura es un di logo interior y para eso necesito poder hablar conmigo
1745279 no sacamos nada con tener una gran colecci n si los libros van a estar juntando polvo en los estantes por eso la biblioteca debe ser un espacio l dico colorido y dotado de cierta magia que invite y seduzca donde los ni os quieran estar leer y sentirse c modos y el motor que hace que eso funcione es la bibliotecaria una persona que es capaz de de atraer al lector captar su inter s ofrecerle lecturas que correspondan a sus inquietudes y finalmente pavimentar el camino de la b squeda aut noma del saber
1745280 la biblioteca nunca bajo ninguna circunstancia puede ser un lugar de castigo si queremos que los ni os lean debe ser a trav s del compromiso afectivo la biblioteca es el lugar donde ellos entran en comuni n con los libros es un lugar de celebraci n no la c rcel del colegio
1745281 if chaos were to descend upon iraq or the forces of democracy were to be defeated in that country this would have implications for the rest of the middle east region and indeed the world
1745282 the consequences for the people of iraq would be catastrophic

1745286 they first started as a kind of militia sort of organized armed groups which were the military wing of various factions and they have they had a considerable role to play in the security vacuum that was created by the invasion
1745287 so you have these militias now with police gear and under police insignia basically carrying out an agenda which really is not in the interest of the country as a whole
1745288 my observations would confirm that at least at a certain point last year and in 2005 we saw numerous instances where the behavior of death squads was very similar uncannily similar to that we had observed in other countries including el salvador
1745289 my message to the iraqi people is to stand united and bonded and not to fall into the western trap the west is trying to divide the iraqi people as god is my witness i hereby demand an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the occupation forces from iraq
1745290 we say that the occupiers are responsible for such crisis golden mosque bombing there is only one enemy the occupier
1745291 especially since occupation forces did not comply with curfew orders imposed by the iraqi government
1745292 evidence indicates that the occupation may be trying to undermine and weaken the iraqi government
1745293 this may in the end be what washington wants because if iraq plunges into chaos it could be the bush ticket out of the iraq debacle albeit paid for in rivers of iraqi blood as well the utter humiliation of the presidents administration and its neo con agenda
1745294 to force the shia to attack the mosques and other properties respected by the sunni
1745295 in shahrivar two british intelligence officers were arrested in september 2005 at an inspection post while carrying a considerable amount of explosives detonators and other equipment necessary to build a bomb this event certainly shows the direct involvement of the english intelligence service in the bombings in iraq the commander of the english military deployed in basra then issued an order to attack the police centre and release two english saboteurs
1745296 and if we continue to make that kind of progress yes we can win in iraq

1745448 for indie labels it was a big adjustment because we ended up with a lot of cds on hand when downloading happened we knew it was coming it came but it happened a little bit faster than we thought
1745449 there were business decisions that were hard but i love the freedom that downloading has brought and i love the way it saves resources
1745450 the internet has revolutionized the diy movement and its great to me i dont even know if record labels need to exist i dont even know if i need to exist
1745451 its like youre doing all this stuff the traveling and the unpacking and the packing just to play the show and in that one moment during the show thats the fun thats where all the fun is
1745452 you get to see different places get to go running in a different town every day its very stimulating and that can be a very good thing

1745458 right around the summer of 76 when you 86ed yourself from the
1745459 no memory of it at all but i aint no marcel proust
1745460 they showed me some footage but i dont have a feel for the movie i didnt see enough i wasnt sure who the terminator was i dont know if there is one or if hes the star or the hero these are the things that determine the success and how strong the movie will be
1745461 i hope it is a huge hit i do hope it creates a spectacle on the screen that is what original terminator director created
1745462 yes i take responsibility it was me who approved the use of carbon fibre technology which had never been tested or used in malaysia previously
1745463 the contractor shall be fully responsible for the design execution and maintenance of the work portion of the works for which the design have been accepted by the government and shall absolutely guarantee the government independent of fault that the design materials and workmanship for the works or portion of the works is suitable for the known requirement of the government
1745464 who is going to be held accountable for this monumental man made disaster
1745465 i feel bad because this relationship is bad for me and on top of that im depressed which is making it worse
1745466 if youre already that low down somethings gonna get you
1745467 is it me my current state of mind or is it us or is it him
1745468 this is really breaking me right now and i dont know if its me or us or you but you need to figure it out with me

1745471 i know that the detroit economic club has heard many policy addresses by many leaders in government business and academia policy addresses that dealt in some detail with specific pressing issues of the day from transportation to education to health care and countless other important topics
1745472 but upon reflection i decided instead to step back from the minutiae of any particular issue and offer you something a little different a broad brush approach that is applicable to every issue id like us all to think about some very critical fundamentals some bedrock concepts that derive from centuries of experience and economic knowledge they are in my view eternal principles that should form the intellectual backdrop to what we do as policymakers inside and outside of government
1745473 you cannot pull a man up by dragging another man down
1745474 what are we getting in return if were being asked to give up some of our freedom
1745475 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
1745476 to what degree do you think a person is entitled to the fruits of his labor
1745477 clearly that does not make a lot of sense as there was more disease in those animals but they also gained faster
1745478 some data show a clear economic detriment of exposure to pi animals yet other data fail to detect an adverse effect on performance the effect is not predictable and may be strain specific
1745479 i believe the acute infections are more from commingling and sale barn type of environments
1745480 instead of serial virus isolation we could take one sample and be reasonably confident that we could identify pi animals within a few days
1745481 this enabled logistically feasible and cost effective research so that we could at least begin to evaluate the effects of pi animals in feedlots identify pi animals in cowherds etc
1745482 further there is the potential for real time bvdv tests in the future that could identify pi animals using complex but portable or chute side pattern recognition algorithms
1745483 today there is not enough literature to support testing all cattle entering the feedlot
1745484 we as veterinarians cannot market disease we have not answered all of the questions as to whether testing on arrival at the feedyard is warranted
1745485 if anything i think the feedlots are testing and relaying information back to the cow calf producers we are doing this backwards we are trying to control a cow calf disease at the feedlot level it is too late
1745486 also i hope that in time research clearly demonstrates to producers that the major point of impact and most important point of control is at the cow calf level
1745487 biosecurity is nearly non existent in our marketing and feeding system customer yards are using bvdv status for marketing themselves to gain more clients order buyers are using it to sell more cattle veterinarians are using it to sell more tests and gain more clients university guys are using it to get more research if we vaccinated all the cows in the on a regular basis this would be a non issue in five to 10 years

1745520 there are in this report unacceptable accusations leveled against french politicians and the french military
1745521 we are witnessing for several years now an insidious attempt to re write history
1745522 this efforts goal is to transform france into a party engaged in complicity in the genocide this is an unacceptable falsification
1745523 during the time i was in charge of french diplomacy april 1993 to may 1995 we made every effort possible to help in the reconciliation of rwandans

1745533 in the last decade progress has been made in establishing criminal responsibility for the recruitment and use of child soldiers the recruitment and participation in hostilities of children under the age of 15 was first prohibited by the 1977 additional protocols to the geneva conventions in 1998 governments negotiating the rome statute of the international criminal court recognized that this prohibition had achieved the status of customary international law they agreed that the conscription enlistment or use in hostilities of children under the age of 15 should be considered a war crime under the court s jurisdiction whether carried out by members of national armed forces or non state armed groups significantly delegates drafting the treaty agreed that the statute s definition would apply not only to the use of children for direct participation in combat but also their active participation in military activities linked to combat such as scouting spying sabotage their use as decoys couriers or at military checkpoints and direct support functions such as carrying supplies to the front line
1745534 the issue jjm isnt khadrs legal citizenship which is merely a piece of paper cynically obtained and used

1745591 this needs to happen and happen quickly the working people of this country need protection there are to many forces against this and the board needs to step up and say enough is enough
1745592 stronger consumer protections and clearer prohibitions against unfair and deceptive credit card lending practices are long overdue the credit card industry today is rife with unfair deceptive and predatory practices the proposed rule would put an end to some of these abusive practices unless expanded however the proposed rule would leave untouched some of the most blatantly unfair credit card practices in existence today
1745593 the udap unfair and deceptive acts or practices proposal is very broad directly impacts significant aspects of chases credit card business and if finalized as proposed is likely to have profound effects on chases operations and financial results we have substantial concern that these effects will ultimately work to the detriment of its consumers
1745594 aba believes that the board the ots and the ncua should proceed cautiously in establishing unfairness rules under their udap rule making authority udap situations are often characterized by case specific facts that defy industry wide generalization in exercising their ftca section 18 f 1 rule making authority the agencies must be mindful to apply standards that properly consider the unique attributes of the banking sector and take extra care in performing their analysis because it will have precedent setting application far beyond the particular practices at issue

1745603 the present state of protestantism is only intermistic it can save itself only by passing beyond itself in this country particularly our sect system is an evil that may be said to prey upon the very vitals of the church the evil itself however is but the index of a false element incorporated with the life of protestantism itself the case then is not to be remedied by any merely external change we are not called to a crusade against sects as they stand as though storming them to the ground we could do for christianity all that is needed in this direction only as the sect principle can be reached and cured in the inward habit of the church may any such revolution in connection with the openings and orderings of gods providence be expected to take place as the existing crisis demands

1745608 its a multi billion dollar industry dieting every year someone comes up with a new spin on the age old question of how to stay fit when i was growing up we dutifully memorized our four food group chart which was later replaced by the food pyramid i was shocked to learn recently that the food pyramid wasnt based on true scientific research but on government subsidy politics so once again were told to learn something new thankfully one book never changes the bible thats why dr rex russells book should be on every parents bookshelf it serves as a companion to gods word explaining in laymens terms how to eat based on the creators plan and its chock full of warm and witty anecdotes from dr russells research and life work despite our massive improvements in sanitation nutrition and medical research studies show the average americans lifespan could decrease by as much as five years in the coming decades why is that its because we eat too much eat the wrong things and were too fat more than 60 of adults and 30 of children are overweight or obese putting themselves at a higher risk of cancer diabetes heart disease and a variety of other illnesses what the bible says about healthy living is based on three simple principles 1 eat the foods god created for you 2 dont alter gods design 3 dont let any food or drink become your god this book also has a chapter on fasting which is a topic everyone needs to understand you see examples of it throughout the bible but how many of us actually practice it habitually dr russell tells the case of a nine year old girl with severe dyslexia who was undergoing expensive therapies and treatments yet still couldnt read the surprise came after she fasted a few days from having the flu she could read her parents discovered her learning problems were diet related they learned she was sensitive to sugar corn white flour margarine honey and other frequently eaten foods i think many kids who are diagnosed with add and other disorders could be cured through cutting processed food out of their diets and getting hours and hours of fresh air and exercise outside instead of being forced to sit still indoors easier said than done of course but its still a lifestyle to aim for this is a book i bought on the recommendation of sue becker of the bread beckers in atlanta i try to read it once a year to remind myself of the health truths found in the bible its a staple to add to every moms shelf of cookbooks and gives hope to those suffering from health problems i also like george malkmus hallelujah diet and books though eating a mostly raw diet is tough when trying to feed kids still it is something to keep in mind and its a diet that is biblically based and has cured thousands from severe disease

1745612 this is the first time a congressional committee has ever passed consumer protections for credit cardholders but we are not out of the woods just yet
1745613 in its current form this bill seeks to lock into law restrictions on fundamental risk management activities the way interest is calculated and other responsible business practices
1745614 the result will be higher costs for consumers reduced access to credit for those with an imperfect or limited credit history and less access to low credit options

1745625 we have see the same thing in several outbreaks in the dole spinach outbreak we or clients had to hire private labs to link two deaths to the outbreak when local state and national health officials could not be bothered whether it is a lack of funding or sheer laziness ignoring the public and the publics health puts all of us in danger when not if a bioterrorism event occurs ill people like the grubbs will be our early warning system and we darn will better be paying attention

1745783 most companies would call themselves innovative and would claim theyre delivering an above average service to their customers yet their customers opinions might differ if you drill a company on their innovation practices they would probably mention two approaches they employ 1 their research department meets with target groups compiles presentations for the upper management which then occasionally hands those reports over to the development department 2 their research or marketing department comes up with competitive matrix of the products available from competition in a meeting then executives see that their product is missing a feature and hence the development department is assigned the task of adding an internet enabled installer to the product since everybody else offers them thereby creating market expectations

1745805 as we look at the year ahead we anticipate an increasingly difficult economic environment
1745806 the escalating price of energy the depression of real estate values and liquidity and competence issues in the finance sector are creating economic shocks that will likely be felt by the vast majority of consumers in the us as well as in europe and maybe elsewhere
1745807 we think theres enough uncertainty around for us to put the strength of our balance sheet as the absolutely no1 priority
1745808 to be operating in a much more difficult economic environment than we did this past year and in particular a significantly more challenging local advertising environment for both broadcast television and newspapers
1745809 the total local ad market was down 10 per cent in the fourth quarter and pacings for the first quarter of 2009 continue to be weak
1745810 while we continue to generate a growing market share of the ad markets actually a record market share in july the overall ad market is highly challenged at the moment
1745811 to better respond to the economic challenges we may face this year
1745812 all of our newspapers have a complementary commercial strategy exploiting the display space of print and re purposing content for the web so the inventory can be re sold

1745818 having the flowers was beautiful and distinctive but it has a certain lifespan
1745819 it sends out the wrong message about what the magazine is and from a brand position it created confusion people were thinking it was a craft or gardening or home maker magazine they believed it had a very narrow focus which it doesnt
1745820 i would like to see the circulation moving ahead significantly from where it is
1745821 it has a really good community of readers who love it but we think it has a lot of potential to strike out into the market as a mass brand like the weekly

1745823 are there individual performances that for you still exemplify what you want to see at the olympics
1745824 if youre referring to sportsmanship there are just so many instances one was grant davies the australian 1000 metre kayak representative in seoul in 1988 who had a gold medal for 11 minutes he was named after the event as the winner his name went up on the scoreboard he signed for the gold medal he was hailed by a very noisy crowd just before the victory ceremony there was a late flash that the jury had looked at the finish of the event and decided the american greg barton had won it by 002 of a second a coat of varnish the media particularly the australian media immediately said how disappointed are you how can you live with this and grant said look if thats the biggest disappointment i ever have ill have a pretty happy life the interesting aspect of that is that i live in main beach in queensland and i go for walks along the beach most mornings and the lifeguard on duty is a bloke called grant davies and hes a very happy man he has had a very happy life

1745832 only about 20 per cent of all the internet users in the world use social networking
1745833 its really about engaging with users where you really have true viral marketing
1745834 mobile is another opportunity to monetise social networking as well as virtual goods and gaming
1745835 australian idols the big one for the back half of the year
1745836 there will be no media consumption left in 10 years that is not delivered over an internet network there will be no newspapers no magazines that are delivered in paper form

1745839 newspapers will continue to supply information to their public and communities

1745842 part of our philosophy was always to have been the voice of the south and by the south we dont talk about the geographic south we talk about the cultural political and social economic south which is really another way of saying the developing world
1745843 in our vision for 2008 one of the things that we put in place was a strategy of multimedia broadcasting
1745844 while we do have an audience that is very influential there is still a wider audience out there and the youth market for one is one we can get into
1745845 we use tools like youtube and are putting up full length programming on youtube feature programs news programs available for free
1745846 it is part of the strategy to reach new audiences that we may not have reached
1745847 we have journalists go into the sahara or places in africa where there are no other journalists and they have to get smuggled across the border at high risk to their lives they could not show their footage until they left the country because they would have been killed
1745848 that sort of reporting is still very important to news organisations using highly skilled journalists who are aware of the risks
1745849 the proposals funded this year using advanced biomedical approaches will lead to a much deeper understanding than has been possible in the past on how celestial radiation differs from radiation on earth
1745850 labour have said over and over again that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing it is difficult for health service estates to maintain a completely pest free environment but the level and variety of these infestations is concerning
1745851 were not claiming that there has been some change over time because there is no previous data
1745852 these figures must be put into context it goes without saying that as the fourth largest trust in the country our hospitals are bigger than most others around the country and therefore our figures should be compared with trusts with similar sized estates rather than smaller acute trusts
1745853 cleanliness and hygiene are issues of critical importance to patients and the public we receive a wide range of information on hygiene from different sources however concerns around pest control have to date been negligible
1745854 clearly in a small minority of cases these infestations are actually impacting directly on the areas where patients are present
1745855 they locked the door on me they got the sandwiches i paid for inside their store im not leaving here till i get what i paid for im not going to pay 12 for some sandwiches and not get what i paid for

1745864 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
1745865 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states

1745893 the ioc takes this as a serious breach of the news access rules
1745894 taking into consideration the nature of the breach of the rules and that a similar venue breach incident was also committed by a nine network cameraman upon the occasion of the 2004 athens olympic games the iocs position is that a sanction should now be imposed
1745895 i dont know where this idea came from that weve been sent home and banned from the olympics nothing could be further from the truth
1745896 weve been given a sanction and we dont want to downplay that but all that we wont be able to do is to put our names in for a lottery that were not likely to win very often
1745897 practically its not going to effect our coverage from beijing very much
1745898 of those released 19 have already served their respective sentences while 16 were proven to be innocent of charges filed against them
1745899 full support in improving access to justice especially by those who could least afford it
1745900 now we are considering to accommodate those interested to apply for a loan but will just be starting out
1745901 some of those are already fully paid while others are preparing to file a new loan application
1745902 our analysis showed there were more traffic accidents among persons who learned to drive through experience than those who actually enrolled in driving schools
1745903 most drivers who got involved in traffic accidents learned how to drive through experience without knowing the basic laws and rules of the road from an authorized driving school
1745904 in driving schools all traffic signs and traffic rules are being taught
1745905 the philippine national police or pnp can only enforce traffic rules but motorists should also do their part enrolling in an authorized driving school will be a great help
1745906 drivers on motorcycles without helmet have a 95 percent chance of getting killed in accidents
1745907 i say i dont care about bringing down the government
1745908 i just want you to get me good flash quotes
1745909 we bring in a news service for hire if you like
1745910 the idea is to be the eyes and ears of the media in the venues so if you are a hungarian journalist covering the canoeing but theres a fencer doing something and a modern pentathlete from your country doing something somewhere else you cant be everywhere we try to fill in the gaps for everybody
1745911 provide the flash quotes and bits and pieces journalists need to pull it together to write the story
1745912 then the big breakthrough came when we got a contract with the rugby world cup in australia in 2003
1745913 what we have found over the years is that australians are probably more easy going in environments such as the olympics
1745914 they are quite stressful environments to work in because most of the time you are told no australians tend to find another way around the road blocks we make no apologies for using aussies they are can do people
1745915 so far so good ang performance ni harry ngayon because of the training
1745916 puro olympians ang nakalaban niya doon at nakakuha siya ng gold medal magandang senyales iyan sa performance niya
1745917 malaki kasi ang exposure napakalaki noon dahil doon natin mage gauge kung nasaan na tayo sa training natin
1745918 dumating dito yung indonesia dumating dito yung mexico nagpunta sila sa baguio nagustuhan nila yung klima yung gym international standards
1745919 kaya ako naniniwala ako nakapagpadala tayo ng limang boxers before walang nangyari nakapag uwi tayo ng medalya pero yung gintong medalya natin e wala pa rin
1745920 siguro binigay na ni lord to na isa na lang para makapag focus kay harry

1745923 what we are witnessing right now is merely an extension of an ongoing power play in the power industry with the lopez empire staging a counter strike against the palaces backed power grab by winston garcia for control of meralco
1745924 corruption in the industry permeating through all three branches of government is now part of its anatomy and successful industry players past and present have only thrived under a rent seeking economic and political environment
1745925 the country cannot escape the obvious reality that the private sectors primary objective in the power industry is to make profit at the soonest time possible and not to provide genuine public services at all times and at least cost
1745926 the required two thirds vote of the senate is only 15 senators so we only need one more vote that wont be hard because the issue of constitutionality has already been settled
1745927 eric has what it takes to be an olympic champion
1745928 he is disciplined determined strong and self confident he is ready and believes in his chances so lets pray the breaks go for him
1745929 because shooting is done outdoors weather makes competition conditions unequal for all shooters but eric is technically and mentally prepared any type of weather condition
1745930 all the 33 shooters competing in the event have equal skills so it will be one great contest
1745931 eric is respected by his fellow competitors which adds to his confidence
1745932 eric is in the list with harry ta amor of boxing and toni rivero and tshomlee go of taekwondo eric did very well in the world cup this year and he might just surprise us in beijing
1745933 because of budget constraints eric had a choice of getting a foreign coach or competing overseas
1745934 he felt competing abroad would boost his confidence and it really worked eric basically trains by himself in laoag where he is from but in beijing his official coach is james chua president of the pnsa affiliated moving target associations
1745935 in athens there were over 50 shooters in trap but in beijing the list is down to less than 40
1745936 erics confidence is very high particularly since his best ever performance in suhl
1745937 so far so good ang performance ni harry ngayon because of the training

1745945 we may not agree with the logic employed for moving this waste but in the interest of a positive relationship with our host community weve decided to move this to temple
1745946 but in my 20 years in this business ive never seen
1745947 the biggest thing for us was that waste management was not keeping us informed i think theyre going a long ways toward repairing that relationship
1745948 they are efforts that dont in any way address the bigger issues and were afraid perhaps at some level that these initial efforts could kind of create a smoke screen around the bigger issues

1745980 were looking at fundamental science fundamental mathematics that in many ways are a mess of jumbled data
1745981 we try to give them a structure because as humans we make these inferences so much better when our data has structure
1745982 then an investigator needs to put this all together and connect the dots find the coherent story

1745995 i dont believe there was any statement trying to be made
1745996 the combination of air quality humidity and intense heat in beijing will ensure that the competition will be very demanding
1745997 dismissed such steps as wearing face coverings as the product of undue fears which it said were stirred up by foreign media
1745998 its understandable that foreign athletes would worry about their physical health but for this to reach the stage of wearing masks is somewhat exaggerated the beijing olympic games are being subjected to mean even unfair reporting by some western media when beijing has a hazy day western media beat this up as beijings severe pollution
1745999 recent hot summer days when an uncomfortable mix of humidity dust and fumes has built up in still air has also drawn grumbling from locals and prompted families to keep children and the elderly indoors
1746000 allege d that air quality near the main olympic venues had fail ed the governments own safe target for dust particles on most days
1746001 the authors of the study from the chinese research academy of environmental sciences had taken independent readings
1746002 concentrations of three pollutants sulphur dioxide carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide were low or acceptable they found but those of two of the most important as far as runners are concerned ozone and particulates such as fine dust were much higher than the values of the standard for the key pm10 reading for the presence in the air of particulate matter measuring 10 micrometers in diameter or less beijing defines its level two standard as 100 micrograms per cubic meter compared with 50 for the world health organization the new chinese study which was published in the journal air quality atmosphere and health collected pm10 measurements daily from aug 17 to sept 30 last year the daily average was 190 micrograms nearly double beijings safe limit which was breached on 34 out of 45 days ozone was measured from aug 7 to sept 30 last year and good limits were breached on 30 days out of 55

1746014 gostaria antes de mais de agradecer aos t cnicos agora anunciados o facto de terem aceite o convite que lhes dirigi com todo o empenho e dedica o vamos procurar cumprir com as expectivas e ambi es que todos esperam da selec o nacional a todos dou as boas vindas e desejo a melhor sorte do mundo
1746015 em todos eles deposito a minha confian a pessoal e n o tenho d vidas quanto s suas qualidades profissionais e humanas estando certo que contribuir o decisivamente para levarmos a selec o a atingir os objectivos que tra mos
1746016 sinto me um privilegiado por dois motivos fundamentais por um lado por voltar a um espa o onde todos gostam de trabalhar a selec o nacional a pela sua transcend ncia e import ncia e por outro por ter a oportunidade de reiniciar uma colabora o com carlos queiroz um profissional a quem reconhe o enormes qualidades humanas e t cnicas
1746017 recebi este convite com muita surpresa mas com igual satisfa o um orgulho muito grande representar o meu pa s e fazer parte desta equipa t cnica que liderada por um dos melhores treinadores do mundo
1746018 estou extremamente optimista e motivado para o novo ciclo que agora come a j conhe o as pessoas que constituem esta equipa em especial o prof carlos queiroz com o qual ajudei a escrever duas das mais importantes p ginas do futebol portugu s conquistando dois t tulos mundiais sub 20 temos desde j um desafio important ssimo pela frente que a qualifica o para o mundial 2010 e estou certo que com uma grande coes o entre todos vamos atingir os nossos objectivos

1746021 this 250 000 grant to the west kentucky workforce investment board will boost efforts to expand the regions economy and increase job opportunities for kentucky workers
1746022 this grant will provide these workers with access to services to help them return to work as quickly as possible
1746023 it is stabilised but not at all under control we dont think it will be extinguished until tomorrow
1746024 as you ride in boston through our diverse neighborhoods in our great parks and past our historic buildings you feel closer to our city its a connection that extends to people because biking brings people together riding a bike is a fun way to deepen your relationship with this great city
1746025 natural gas prices this summer have hit levels not seen since the fall of 2005 when supplies were disrupted by hurricanes katrina and rita
1746026 although prices have fallen in recent weeks it still seems likely that heating costs this winter will be higher than in the last two years
1746027 now is the time to prepare for the heating season by weatherizing your home
1746028 a little bit of caulking or insulation now can make a big difference when cold weather arrives
1746029 while the high prices now are certainly cause for concern they are coming at a time when most consumers are using relatively little natural gas
1746030 if prices continue their current trend the situation could improve before the start of winter
1746031 we have attempted to show all known claims agreed boundaries and one thing that has not appeared on any other maps which is the number of areas that could be claimed by canada denmark and the us
1746032 we are talking 90 million barrels of oil nearly 17 hundred trillion cubic feet
1746033 i suppose for any state control over hydrocarbons is significant as other resources dwindle
1746034 the other factor is the melting of the polar ice and that is making it easier to explore the area which is why the oil and gas industry is looking at it
1746035 it is now becoming a potential area of development rather than a hypothetical one
1746036 it is vulnerable and extracting oil and gas is not an environmentally friendly activity
1746037 the president has just been arrested by a commando who came to fetch him arrested him here and took him away
1746038 the airport is closed i think it will stay that way for a while until the new authorities get organised
1746039 the exemplary democratic advances which the country has made since the 2005 coup detat
1746040 assess the situation on the ground and to assist in promoting a peaceful solution to the crisis
1746041 these officers three generals refused to accept the presidential decree and are rebelling against the constitutional order
1746042 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1746043 we fully intend to move forward with additional prosecutions on the 20 other cases that are currently in the military commission system
1746044 this military commission finds you on charge number one conspiracy not guilty of charge two material support for terrorism guilty
1746045 is material support a war crime the defense believes it is not
1746046 a good outcome for the government in arguing that this was a fair trial
1746047 the fourth factor the ability of the defense to mount a full defense is where the criticism of the process likely will be levied
1746048 the verdict was in long before the jury began to deliberate
1746049 there is a myth that drug abuse is only a big city problem but vermont and other rural areas are also coping with its problems
1746050 these groups and their creative leadership closely monitor trends in their communities and steadily work to address them
1746051 it has been more than a year since the housing market went on a tumultuous skid yet the hangover from bad lending practices and tighter credit has housings two primary sponsors fannie mae and freddie mac still unable to step in and fully provide support
1746052 given the likelihood of a prolonged housing slump and the uncertainty of government support investors should remain extremely cautious of lenders like freddie mac or fannie mae
1746053 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1746054 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion dollars of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1746055 torture has done tremendous damage to americas reputation around the world violates u s and international law and makes it harder to fight the war on terror its time to turn this page in our nations history and outlaw torture and secret detentions once and for all
1746056 this legislation is already in the intelligence authorization bill but we believe we have an obligation to ensure its passage so were introducing it as a separate piece of legislation as well we will pursue every legislative option until we finally outlaw torture and secret detentions by americas intelligence agencies
1746057 the presidents misguided interrogation policies have damaged our nations reputation and hindered our counterterrorism efforts
1746058 changing these policies has been a priority for the senate intelligence committee for two years but we have been blocked by the president and senate republicans today i join senators feinstein and hagel and other members in sending a clear signal that the u s intelligence community will not engage in torture
1746059 the bush administrations embrace of torture and secret detentions has led our country down a dark hallway
1746060 never again should the practices of our government turn so far away from the values of our people i hope these measures will help put right what has gone so badly wrong and restore the stature and goodwill and support this nation had earned around the world before this administration took office these measures are vital to cooperating with our allies and winning the war on terrorism
1746061 this funding helps communities build better neighborhoods from the ground up
1746062 whether its improving infrastructure or producing more homes families can afford hud grants have the potential to breathe new life into communities and make them better places to live and work
1746063 the portrait gallery is a great addition to the uspto museum
1746064 it makes for an enlightening and entertaining history lesson that compares the humble beginnings of the ip system to the important role that the uspto now plays in modern society
1746065 our investigation discovered harassment that engaged in the worst stereotypes and slurs about blacks latinos and jews and that upper management actively participated in this behavior
1746066 this is a major victory for mr gonzales and mr lewis the employees who testified on their behalf and future employees at video only the settlement should send a strong message that harassment based on race national origin and religion has no place in the workplace and that those who speak out against discrimination are protected by law from retaliation
1746067 the kind of heavy handed intimi dation video only employed led us to seek a pre trial ruling the courts june 11 finding affirms eeocs position that retaliation designed to frighten employees from reporting or testifying about discrimination violates the law these employees should be recognized for their courage in stepping forward
1746068 on july 2 we observed the 44th anniversary of title vii of the civil rights act yet race discrimination still remains a persistent problem in todays contemporary workplace
1746069 the eeoc urges employers to be vigilant in guarding against race discrimination in all aspects of employment
1746070 all employees should have the freedom to compete for promotions on a fair and level playing field without regard to race we are pleased that there are now effective procedures in place at this company to ensure that promotional opportunities are based on qualifications not race
1746071 many people are starting to realise that doing nothing is no longer an option when it comes to climate change we all have a part to play
1746072 the green team have some really positive ideas about how to get out and about and spread their message im very pleased that the lancashire local committee was able to approve this grant to get the project up and running
1746073 our aim is not to alarm or lecture anyone but simply to encourage people to make a real start and gradually make a difference
1746074 we want to raise peoples awareness about the negative effects of climate change and show people how they can make small changes to their lifestyles that will collectively make a big difference
1746075 lancaster and morecambe travellers and friends certainly made the first ever gypsy roma traveller history month in 2008 a month to remember and i am sure it is an event to go on from strength to strength next year
1746076 in an effort to deal with the high cost of oil and gasoline at the pump
1746077 on july 28 2008 in a floor debate i challenged majority leader reid directly to keep the senate in session during august for that purpose he declined responding that republicans would suffer more than democrats because more republican senate seats were in jeopardy i countered with the observation that it wasnt a matter of whether republicans or democrats would suffer the most but that the issue was the suffering of the american people from the high cost of oil and gasoline
1746078 for months the senate has been dysfunctional and gridlocked for reasons specified in my op ed article copy enclosed which is published in the philadelphia inquirer today i further suggest that you call upon senator reid to suspend his practice of filling the tree at least during the august session so that the senate can perform its traditional function and legislate
1746079 filling the amendment tree is a very bad practice it runs against the basic nature of the senate the hallmark of the senate is free speech and open debate
1746080 to basically lock out any amendments runs contrary to the very essence of this body
1746081 unfortunately 9 11 changed the way the world thinks about their vulnerability aboard airliners tokyo madrid and london further illustrated that the rails and buses were not immune from terrorist attack
1746082 our goal is to make certain we coordinate to the fullest extent possible with our law enforcement partners including first responders and wmd experts we want to ensure preparedness in combating the growing threat of transportation sector terrorism
1746083 counterterrorism today is a team activity tsas strategy is to start with intelligence partner with law enforcement airports our international colleagues and industry partners and the public and use security measures that are flexible widely deployable mobile and layered to cover our open transportation network if the terrorists strength is that they have no deadlines rules or borders ours is that this is our turf there are a lot of us and we have a lot of resources
1746084 i am pleased that work to improve this dangerous junction can start soon
1746085 i know that this has taken a long time but we have had to negotiate with landowners to purchase the land and listen to the views we have received from local people affected by the scheme
1746086 now it is full steam ahead to get the roundabout built and improve road safety for all
1746087 work will start in three months and will be completed by spring or summer
1746088 we would like to see our contractor on site much sooner but we are bound by the requirements of the traffic management act which requires all organisations that work on the highway to give three months notice
1746089 it is our belief that net 3 5 in general and silverlight in particular will change programming more significantly than anything that has come from microsoft for a least a decade
1746090 over the last few releases microsoft has introduced some major advances to the net framework that transform the way developers write managed applications
1746091 this book provides the brain upgrade you need to harness the full power of visual studio 2008 and net framework 3 5

1746093 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
1746094 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
1746095 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
1746096 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
1746097 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
1746098 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
1746099 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
1746100 confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1746101 we believe that the evening standards front page story today titled prince philip defies cancer scare is a serious breach of prince philips privacy
1746102 buckingham palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy particularly in relation to their personal health
1746103 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumours that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
1746104 we will continue to observe this long standing practice but on this occasion because the damaging story is now being reported widely the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1746105 we believe there has been a serious breach of the duke of edinburghs right to privacy and we will be taking this issue to the press complaints commission
1746106 we will be asking the pcc to remind all editors of their obligations
1746107 everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life home health and correspondence including digital communications
1746108 editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individuals private life without consent
1746109 we have been informed that we will be receiving a complaint regarding the duke of edinburgh story over clauses one and three of the code accuracy and privacy but we have not yet received it
1746110 we updated the story for the later edition we will respond to any potential enquiry from the pcc but we do believe that there is a public interest in the health of the duke of edinburgh

1746124 disturbingly the investigation has revealed that polchan used his connections not only with the outlaws and the outfit but also with various corrupt police officers to advance his and his associates criminal objectives
1746125 we are very grateful for the tremendous start we had in this game
1746126 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1746127 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
1746128 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go and well take out this part the second half for when we play against japan and new zealand

1746138 i and four other playwright bloggers thank you enrique peter prince and tim are blogging to help fundraise a theatre library for a middle school in queens ny the who last week i discovered a great philanthropy web site called donors choose its a site dedicated entirely to raising funds for public education teachers propose projects i e field trips text books or money for a library and donors choose reviews the proposals and posts the ones that pass the initial screening i was on the site last week and did a search for theatre thats when i found this proposal a queens middle school has just added theatre to their curriculum but they have no theatre books how much the proposal were supporting is asking for 511 total thats it so if 50 people give 10 each well make our goal the why this project really struck a chord with me perhaps its because i come from a family of educators and i know how frustrating it is to try and teach without adequate supplies or because i came from a small town and know what its like to be a student with outdated equipment but most importantly its because i love theatre we love theatre and we want to support theatre and the future of theatre so dear readers if you can drop by the site and help us give that middle school in queens a theatre library and please spread the word thanks m

1746166 who gives a if it makes a dent in the worlds oil supply
1746167 the only energy plan obama has is inflated tires and that wont work as well as our oil drilling idea
1746168 they really are no better than the ones they are trying to put down
1746169 obama didnt visit wounded troops but did make time to go to the gym
1746170 the oil companies have thousands of acres to already drill on why do they need more
1746171 even if we did drill it would take 10 years
1746172 drilling for oil wont lower the price at the pump

1746192 the decision to exclude the james smack campaign is very unfortunate

1746203 if a customer came to us who wanted to run a different operating system on our hardware wed say here you go
1746204 it is vitally important that developers have access to this data and it improves product quality going forward we think that more manufactures and more consumers will demand open architecture products with optimum performance
1746205 why should industry be afraid of opening up its design schematics are simply another form of documentation and vital to future success service and satisfaction in the market we believe our products would be incomplete without them
1746206 we think ralph a native american player of extraordinary talent
1746207 we compare him to jamerio moon now with the toronto raptors and think the fans will be very excited to see him in action
1746208 its like when you have two kids you dont love one more than the other
1746209 im just excited that fans across the country think so much of our two ballparks
1746210 we had only considered doing a ballparks review when we first launched the annual article
1746211 then the hockey people came to us and said hey what about us we had ballpark experts but no arena experts available then we thought about it the best experts are the fans themselves who attend the games and use the facilities this is our second year of opening up the rankings to the fans and they have added an immense amount of information about what is great and what needs fixing at venues across the continent
1746212 the frost heaves will continue to deliver to fans and sponsors the affordable crowd pleasing entertainment experience to which vermonters have become accustomed
1746213 we look forward to a greater degree of predictability in the pbl both in the quality of the competition and the standards of operation we see in our fellow teams
1746214 we had a great run in the aba and will always regard our back to back titles with affection and pride
1746215 but our coaches players and entire organization welcome the new challenges and opportunities that will come with this move

1746218 were still a young culture many of us are first generation americans
1746219 the priorities for my parents werent sports they were to put bread on the table to move ahead and become good american citizens
1746220 outreach programs would make things easier for people less fortunate help the kids who have potential to maybe find the road to the next level
1746221 right now there is no road its bushwhacking your way through to the other side and most of them get lost
1746222 the parents dont know their way through the system a lot of the kids cant get scholarships as easily as african americans can
1746223 i need to find out more i dont have all the answers
1746224 we have to do more to take the fine young athletes that exist among new americans and find some ways of creating opportunities for them they are underrepresented
1746225 i did have some classmates that were discouraged by parents to play sports and many were very talented
1746226 they would start the season on a sports team and halfway through quit because they couldnt make practice they had to baby sit or run errands for their moms
1746227 in commerce more parents now see that their children can represent the u s at the olympics
1746228 the city does a good job of giving their olympians a lot of recognition so residents are forced to become familiar with the olympians and that accessibility gives them hope and encouragement
1746229 the spanish networks need to do their part in exposing hispanic athletes in the nontraditional sports so that parents can see all the options their kids have
1746230 well give the hispanic athletes a special focus but we want to follow the other good stories as well
1746231 it looks like its going to be new york or tampa bay were waiting to find out and we could learn in the next hour or so
1746232 were trying to become a great one well do anything we can to get better and if that involves looking at other players by george thats our job thats our responsibility
1746233 for them to keep us in the dark and just have us answering a bunch of questions that we cant possibly have a good answer for i dont think its fair to us
1746234 i think there needs to be something said yea or nay for brett favre
1746235 we have an excellent opportunity here to be a very good football team in 2008
1746236 weve had an extraordinary challenge dealing with this situation a lot can be learned from it but they definitely want this thing resolved as soon as possible
1746237 when its in your face like this how do you avoid it how do you not allow it to be in the back of your head you cant
1746238 youre thinking about it everybodys in here thinking about it and we just dont know what the next moves going to be

1746301 republicans will do anything to get a vote even if its from bikers
1746302 energy efficiency by using improved technology and practicing sensible habits in our homes businesses and automobiles is a big part of the answer and is something we can achieve right now
1746303 i believe in spinozas god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings
1746304 in view of such harmony in the cosmos which i with my limited human mind am able to recognize there are yet people who say there is no god but what really makes me angry is that they quote me for the support of such views
1746305 i respect that theyre here and spent a lot on their homes but on the other hand give me a little bit too
1746306 these can come out just as easy as they went in
1746307 in the hope of spurring congress to pass a bill allowing artists to take fair market value tax deductions on works they donate to public institutions the art dealers association of america is promising to secure donations by 50 artists to museums in 50 states upon the bills passage
1746308 since 1969 artists composers and writers have only been able to deduct the value of the materials in a work or in the case of writers and composers a manuscript or set of papers that they donate to a museum university or library collectors and heirs by contrast can deduct the fair market value of their donations the bills advocates argue that this acts as a disincentive to artists considering donating works and puts museums at a disadvantage in the skyrocketing contemporary art market

1746310 if i sounded flippant it was because maybe i am sorta over it feminists have built date rape up to being like the most detrimental thing that can happen to a woman but lets face it its not bad yes the worst no
1746311 shes irrelevant and out of touch and resents us for being relevant and in touch
1746312 noggin what noggin i do not know this noggin of which you speak little man
1746313 when the times editors assigned me to the religion beat i believed god had answered my prayers as a serious christian i had cringed at some of the coverage in the mainstream media faith frequently was treated like a circus even a freak show i wanted to report objectively and respectfully about how belief shapes peoples lives along the way i believed my own faith would grow deeper and sturdier
1746314 i was 28 and my first son was less than a year old i had managed to nearly ruin my marriage the second one and didnt think id do much better as a father i was profoundly lost
1746315 had a knack for making scripture accessible and relevant for someone who hadnt studied the bible much these talks fed a hunger in my soul the secrets to living well had been there all along in lifes instruction manual as some christians nicknamed the bible
1746316 designed to grind down your defenses and leave you emotionally raw an easier state in which to connect with god after 36 hours of prayer singing bible study intimate sharing and little sleep i felt filled with the holy spirit
1746317 emotions can be either the barrier or the means to faith likewise for the intellectually gifted person his intelligence can be either a wall or a door
1746318 tears spilled from his eyes packys faith though severely tested had survived i looked at him with envy where he found comfort i was finding emptiness
1746319 the problem is for such a person the intellect itself must be convicted and converted otherwise it will continue to be ones biggest stumbling block when in reality it can be used as the key to the whole existentialada if properly developed
1746320 you men with wicked hands took and slew the lord of glory
1746321 troubled by the prominence of alcohol advertising in televised college sports
1746322 we strongly urge you to take actions against all alcohol advertising including beer advertising on ncaa sports telecasts
1746323 we believe that this could be done gradually and relatively painlessly
1746324 its refreshing to see so many college presidents athletic directors and coaches standing up for whats best for their institutions sports programs and student athletes
1746325 even officials at many major sports powerhouses which derive some revenue from beer advertising recognize the hypocrisy and illogic of the ncaas sell out to beer peddlers
1746326 is undermining the professed ideals of the olympic games and subverting the olympics veneration of sport with omnipresent commercial messaging and branding
1746327 the commercial games how commercialism is overrunning the beijing 2008 olympic games
1746328 the olympic rush to sell sponsorships to the highest bidders has led to partnerships with companies whose products or methods of doing business betray olympic ideals junk food hawkers beer and liquor peddlers and equipment makers reliant on sweatshop contractors among others
1746329 the horse is out of the barn on olympic sponsorships and the world is unlikely to see a commercial free games anytime soon
1746330 nonetheless the most egregious problems with the olympics pervasive sponsorship arrangements can and should be addressed
1746331 the olympic ideals of promoting authentic culture and education have been drowned beneath a sea of sponsorship and marketing arrangements

1746333 the 2009 toc conference will explore the changing meaning of digital publishing new devices like the kindle and the iphone have opened up new sales and distribution channels for paid content and those channels are as open to new players as to existing publishers new business models are emerging that look very strange to a publisher but at their core do the familiar jobs of developing content aggregating audiences and connecting the two the act of publishing is here to stay but the role of existing publishers remains an open question
1746334 we can only hope that the u s president elected this november will listen conscientiously to the majority

1746344 its got a massive energy efficiency and renewable program and that much of the low carbon technology of the 21st century is being researched built and rolled out in china
1746345 if chinas citizens emitted as much co2 as americas chinas total emissions would be roughly equivalent to those of the entire planet today
1746346 at the g8 if the facts had been in front of the leaders prime minister harper would not have been able to make the statements that he made
1746347 when china sees a genuine commitment from the developed world to reduce developed world emissions and some sort of preparedness to help in technology transfer for the developing world then they will go further
1746348 but the starting point in the west shouldnt be that chinas doing nothing because its spectacularly inaccurate
1746349 we appreciate the generosity of fred franzia and the bronco wine company for establishing this position at fresno state

1746376 now the ties situation has become so dire that the american dress furnishings association the trade group that represents the tie business announced it was shutting down
1746377 with the support of more than 290 members of congress including more than 75 republicans h r 6604 was well on its way to being passed over the two thirds vote requirement sending a clear signal that transparency and enforcement would return to the commodities and futures markets then republican leadership demanded that members change their votes in order to protect president bush
1746378 h r 6604 is a bipartisan bill that passed the agriculture committee by voice vote
1746379 it is the product of a comprehensive series of hearings to examine the issues surrounding futures trading from all sides and it clearly has enough support to pass this house
1746380 we will continue to pursue meaningful steps to address the conditions that have thrown some futures markets into disorder and hope that members will have the courage of their convictions to join us
1746381 its pretty clear that the markets are not functioning as they should
1746382 without adequate oversight and transparency we will only continue down this slippery slope leaving americas family farmers and ranchers in jeopardy
1746383 there are many reasons for high energy prices this bill does not and cannot address all of them however it is a good step to addressing our concerns in the markets
1746384 i urge the senate to act quickly on similar legislation and the house to continue and work toward passing this necessary legislation
1746385 would have required transparency and improved access prevented excessive speculation by requiring the cftc establish requirements limiting speculation and strengthened the cftc with legal authority and increased staffing to address oversight surveillance and regulation
1746386 this is the kind of movie i would run out to see
1746387 the kind of movies i watch are definitely guys movies this is departed this is fear this is all those characters times 10
1746388 i did one other cameo in the entourage pilot but i didnt get to do a scene with jeremy piven
1746389 this time its me and piven going at it so it was fun
1746390 people automatically assumed that i was going to really make that movie
1746391 my agent was even crazy enough to try to get jim cameron to direct it
1746392 we have a chance to be very good in 2008
1746393 we have a good senior class that has the potential to lead us through the battles and a great junior class that numbers wise make up the heart of our team
1746394 you never replace a player of her caliber but can we figure out a way to score goals and win games with her absence absolutely but it will have to be a team effort
1746395 i believe that our goalkeeper position is one that will be very interesting this year
1746396 this potentially could be the biggest of the three question marks mentioned above
1746397 the positive thing is that we are much older as a team much more experienced hopefully some individuals will step up and take a stronger role but i strongly believe that our older players should feel a sense of urgency and this urgency should help them in this department
1746398 if amanda will compete everyday she can be an impact for us
1746399 lindy has a good understanding of the game and is a well rounded player
1746400 samantha and christian have a bright future ahead of them as they have shown much potential if needed this potential could start paying off immediately as we are not above starting a freshman at this position i know that the best person will eventually step up and win the position
1746401 defense will be the heart and soul of this team
1746402 i believe we have the best group of defenders that we have ever had in our program
1746403 i believe if mason and brown come to camp in shape they will play immediately and it will be up to our returning defenders to force me to move them to another position
1746404 i believe that without the addition of our freshmen we are very good in this area of the field i believe our freshmen could push us over the top and make us great in this area of the field if they adjust quickly
1746405 we must get more scoring from our midfield in 2008 than in recent years this should be a fun environment for our players as we will constantly be encouraging them to get forward into the attack
1746406 i think the answer to many of these questions will be positive
1746407 i strongly believe that we will have people step up at the forward position and reach new levels of success

1746504 the next trial that of khalid sheikh mohammad called the mastermind of the sept 11 attacks will be the real bellwether because it is a case that will raise the issue of harsh interrogations and because it is a death penalty case

1746533 tambi n lo hago para distanciarme de quienes quieren usarme como ariete contra el psoe
1746534 la cr tica constructiva no existe pues es una forma sutil de sometimiento o de elogio
1746535 rodr guez zapatero ha sacado del baile interno no hablo de listas electorales a toda una generaci n de socialistas a la que pertenezco y no estoy dispuesto a aplaudir la jugada
1746536 jugada que por cierto el secretario general parece querer repetir con sus conmilitones de lo que se llam nueva v a
1746537 creo como muchos compa eros del psoe que durante la primera legislatura de zapatero hubo abundantes decisiones estrat gicas err neas y peligrosas como fue abrir el mel n territorial que no se sabe adonde nos puede llevar y no pocas ocurrencias algunas car simas

1746543 leyla sabet a member of the ucla research team that built the new optical protein sensor sits in front of the device based on a confocal microscope the ultrasensitive system is being used by the researchers to detect biomarkers in saliva samples that are linked to oral cancer
1746544 the sensor can be integrated into a specially designed lab on a chip or microchip assay and preprogrammed to bind a specific protein of interest generating a sustained fluorescent signal as the molecules attach a microscope then reads the intensity of the fluorescent light a measure of the proteins cumulative concentration in the saliva sample and scientists gauge whether it corresponds with levels linked to developing disease
1746545 in their initial experiments the scientists primed the optical protein sensor to detect the il 8 protein which at higher than normal concentration in saliva is linked to oral cancer using saliva samples from 20 people half healthy the others diagnosed with oral cancer the sensor correctly distinguished in all cases between health and disease importantly the sensor achieved a limit of detection for il 8 that is roughly 100 times more sensitive than todays blood based enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa tests the standard technique to measure protein in bodily fluid
1746546 because saliva has a lower concentration of proteins than blood does the team needed a highly sensitive method to detect the tagged proteins among the background noise stray molecules in saliva that also fluoresce so the researchers used a confocal microscope an imaging system that employs a laser to collect the light generated from a sample to analyze the saliva ho and his team found that focusing the laser light on a specific part of the sample resulted in a lower signal to noise ratio allowing them to detect lower concentrations of the cancer biomarker indeed ho says the device is 100 times more sensitive than the standard protein detection technique elisa
1746547 the ultra sensitive optical protein sensor presented in this paper has a wide number of applications in disease diagnoses measurements for detecting biomarkers in clinical sample are much more challenging than the measurements in buffer due to high background noise contributed by large collections of non target molecules we used clinical saliva samples to validate the functionality of the optical protein sensor clinical detection of disease specific biomarkers in saliva offers a non invasive alternative approach to using blood or urine
1746548 he and his team have already developed a saliva test for oral cancer and sjogrens syndrome a systemic disease in which the bodys immune system attacks the glands that produce saliva and tears dr wong says they have promising early evidence that it will be possible perhaps even within five years to use saliva to detect biomarkers for more systemic diseases like breast lung and pancreatic cancers as well as diabetes
1746549 the benefits of saliva testing versus blood sampling or more invasive diagnostic tests are many says dr wong saliva testing is easier safer and less intrusive since its testing does not require specially trained personnel there is no risk of exposing anyone to blood born diseases also oral fluids do not clot like blood so they not require the same level of manipulation

1746555 hes capable of anything his sprinting is very good and if youve got good sprinting ability you can go out fast with the best in the world without forcing it too much which means youve got something to bring it home with and he finishes well so im very excited for him
1746556 i had a really good feeling about the pool it felt short which is a good thing im looking forward to it obviously all the pools are the same length 50m but when you are feeling really good in the water and you are getting good length off the walls it just feels like you are getting to the other end pretty quickly
1746557 we know that because of the training times that have been done the bodies when you see them at the pool look absolutely fantastic theyve done a great job of shaping themselves they know that they are ready
1746558 our residences are cool and comfortable and we dont plan on doing a great deal of walking out in the atmosphere
1746559 im here to swim and unfortunately i have to miss it
1746560 but i would rather swim the best race of my life than walk in an opening ceremony to tell you the truth
1746561 i just really want to get a good swim in to start the swim team off to show the young ones how its done
1746562 we are also ensuring that we have all the details that are put to the board completely nailed just in case there is any chance of any kind of appeal or legal process

1746570 a nice young man but if he doesnt watch it hes going to get into trouble
1746571 okay idea but good luck getting the south to follow along
1746572 i was apprehensive talking to him because my credibility is very important to me and i recruited him as a wide receiver
1746573 i saw strong safety as a position where he could help us faster
1746574 i really didnt want to make the switch at first
1746575 but i thought over the pros and cons and then realized it wouldnt be a problem i didnt have to move but i did it for the better of the team
1746576 were two deep i think theres not a lot of difference between the first group and the second group and that tells you that you can play a lot of people

1746583 you run into all of that as a little kid and you dont know what to do or how to handle it mentally

1746585 three quarters of the people you idolize and want to grow up to be like barely make a living on their own or couldnt at all most of the people you read regularly are smoke and mirrors some speakers are given subsidies to speak at conferences not because they refuse to come without it but because they cant afford to without it

1746591 i can tell you as a cancer survivor its a desease i wouldnt wish on anyone im very pleased to see the legacy of terry fox continue to raise money for cancer research

1746609 a whole set of governance requirements that an enterprise architect is involved with that an soa practitioner may not be involved with
1746610 trying to define and hopefully raise the consciousness within the ea profession that you need to have more of a business level sensibility
1746611 in case study after case study you run into a chief architect or even a chief technology officer sometimes who has really made that connection in an soa context between not only looking at the business processes but breaking them down into business services and figuring out how to map a technical infrastructure against that that leadership is so important because soa is such an elusive concept that its very easy to fall back into the old habits of enterprise application integration eai and thinking in terms of point to point integration and not thinking in terms about the last presentation that strategic value
1746612 can be learned provided you have a certain level of experience
1746613 we try to find people who have a good solid technical background and who show the aptitude for being able to develop those softer skills then we place them in an environment and give them the challenge to actually develop those skills and maintain those relationships with the business when it works its a really great thing because they can become the trusted partner of our business people and unmask all the difficulties of the it that lies behind
1746614 so that they can challenge the integrators and the suppliers just to make sure that they are doing the right thing that were keeping as open and flexible as we would like to be and so that were not tied into any given supplier

1746625 the committee believes that natynczyks statement that the government has guaranteed the military the kind of sustained and stable funding needed for growth simply does not stand up to reasonable economic analysis
1746626 the five senior officers presented a much rosier picture than has been mooted by many canadian defence analysts
1746627 the canadian forces have been underfunded by both liberal and conservative governments in the past they continue to be underfunded now and they will surely be underfunded with regard to the responsibilities they will be asked to undertake in the future

1746641 this is the first time an irish and a uk development organisation have amalgamated in order to better tackle poverty in africa there are hundreds of organisations all doing well in africa but they can be far more effective if theyre working together
1746642 we are seeing a reduction in our management and administration costs and an increase in our capacity to do more in africa
1746643 if africans are to break free from hunger and poverty then farming and rural development is the key up to 80pc of africans rely on agriculture for their livelihoods it must be at the heart of what we as international development agencies do

1746650 all the relevant agencies to work together in ensuring that cork remains a strong and attractive location for employment and they would work constructively in seeking future diverse employment
1746651 a serious risk of parts of cork becoming unemployment blackspots
1746652 no sign from the government that they appreciate the scale and urgency of the challenge facing cork
1746653 it is adopting a head in the sand approach to what is going on around it we have seen no targeted measures put in place to address the significant job losses in the area we need to put in place a programme to reskill those who have lost their jobs
1746654 our economy has gone from 130 billion five years ago to one worth 160 billion today and that hasnt gone thats still there the real economy continues to perform well
1746655 the one thing we need to do is not to have a kneejerk reaction by cutting left right and centre or by increase taxes but by being focused on what keeps jobs and investment in this economy
1746656 we certainly wont be able to see the kind of spending increases weve seen in the health area over the last decade
1746657 put money aside for the bad years no attempt to control spending

1746667 weve been working hard its been a great effort between the government and the citizens
1746668 for all the outrages against the blessed sacrament around the world
1746669 close observation of the film and of the facts seems to suggest that this is not an elaborate hoax but depicts something that really occurred

1746672 nei film realizzati finora su holmes questo aspetto del suo carattere non mai emerso completamente stiamo cercando di adottare una prospettiva contemporanea che ci riporti alle radici del personaggio in origine sherlock era pi un uomo dazione che non un intellettuale
1746673 come sottolinea il produttore joel silver chi ha presente le storie classiche di conan doyle sa bene che holmes usa spesso le arti marziali per esempio nella famosa battaglia mortale contro lacerrimo nemico
1746674 le tante avventure di holmes sempre nellottica di una rigorosa autenticit e
1746675 sherlock holmes non si basa soltanto sui suoi poteri di deduzione ma prima di tutto un uomo dazione stiamo curando molto laspetto delle arti marziali della boxe a mani nude la vera boxe quella brutale quella che si combatteva prima che fossero introdotte le regole di queensbury anche guy ritchie studia arti marziali quindi penso che ci divertiremo molto
1746676 ha sido un primer encuentro satisfactorio y todas las partes han puesto de su lado para entenderse vamos todos en un mismo barco el valencia y david villa
1746677 villa es jugador del valencia al cien por cien de eso no teng is ninguna duda aqu estamos hablando de otras cosas
1746678 un comportamiento delictivo trasnacional que no es solamente llevado a cabo en argentina sino tambi n en diversas ciudades de italia
1746679 a ra z del conocimiento que obtuve en base a las comunicaciones que mantuvieron los protagonistas argentinos del caso con los italianos se han detectado alrededor de 700 tr mites iniciados en italia con datos totalmente falsos con el prop sito de obtener la ciudadan a italiana y luego el pertinente pasaporte
1746680 que consiguieron al paso por el ltimo premio de la monta a a los 228
1746681 buscaba un jugador capaz de transformarse delante de la defensa con un registro importante de recuperaciones de bal n
1746682 venimos con humildad sabiendo lo dif cil que es repetir xitos
1746683 hacer part cipe a todo el f tbol andaluz de este homenaje a nuestro eterno 16
1746684 luego no va haber tantos entrenamientos como ahora s lo habr n casi partidos por tanto hay que entrenar ahora todo lo que se pueda
1746685 ahora los partidos son de preparaci n y para intentar corregir los mayores errores posibles y sobre todo pensar en el primer partido de liga que es el verdaderamente importante
1746686 jugar m s o menos partidos depende de uno mismo creo que todos los que nos hemos quedado este a o tenemos la confianza del entrenador
1746687 el contrato de ortega es por once meses y quedamos de acuerdo en mantener en reserva los detalles econ micos
1746688 creo que la situaci n que l va a vivir en mendoza es distinta a la que vive en buenos aires aqu no hay tantas tentaciones y adem s vendr con su familia
1746689 ortega va a colocar al independiente rivadavia en una situaci n especial frente al f tbol no creo que esto complique la tarea del entrenador roberto trotta
1746690 trotta est contento de contar con semejante jugador vamos a ayudarlo a resolver el problema que tiene resuelto esto es una buena persona humilde y simple
1746691 esper bamos una decisi n en ese sentido amparada en los aspectos legales nosotros como la federaci n alemana de f tbol dfb defend amos que ni el reglamento de fifa ni la pr ctica imponen la obligatoriedad de ceder a los jugadores
1746692 la fifa actu con ligereza y se precipit al dar su veredicto lo que ha perjudicado la preparaci n de los clubes para la pr xima temporada
1746693 estoy seguro que ser n los primeros juegos con tres atletas en 9 7 soy el plusmarquista estadounidense usain bolt tiene el r cord del mundo y asafa powell es el anterior plusmarquista creo que va a ser una de las carreras m s excitantes de la historia
1746694 por eso es por lo que le respeto al m ximo en este momento
1746695 podr a ser el favorito pero ha sido el tapado y eso le gusta ahora no tiene presi n en su pa s creen que bolt ganar el oro pero es un gran competidor y va a hacer grandes cosas
1746696 mi estado de nimo bastante es relajado fue un rev s sobre todo mentalmente pero al mismo tiempo pienso esto me ayud estando lejos de los medios de comunicaci n un tiempo ninguna entrevista durante tres o cuatro semanas realmente me ha mantenido relajado no he tenido la ansiedad sobre los juegos
1746697 el villarreal ya no es un equipo m s ahora es importante
1746698 cordial como todas las mantenidas pues la sinceridad va por delante
1746699 ya tiene un buen contrato y recibi mucho cari o del club al pagar lo que pag por l el valencia
1746700 no creemos que joaqu n merezca una mejora de contrato y lo nico que deseamos es que su rendimiento deportivo vaya acorde con su calidad
1746701 no se me ha transmitido ninguna oferta por joaqu n
1746702 ya hablaremos largo y tendido hasta el d a 17 y ya veremos
1746703 joaqu n no est disgusto en el valencia el tema es que y hay que entenderlo que los dos a os que ha estado aqu han sido muy muy raros
1746704 adem s lleg ronald koeman que lo que primero que hace a los tres d as de llegar es sacarlo de una convocatoria junto a manuel fernandes y no voy a decir que hubo una especie de persecuci n pero quiz s se le pareci mucho
1746705 un jugador as que no va con su selecci n se deval a
1746706 por ello vamos a dar un poco de tiempo a las personas que acaban de coger esto que tienen un problema muy grande delante para reunirnos con ellos
1746707 es ging dabei f r vw um leben und tod denn die k fer uhr lief nun wirklich ab auch wenn es uns gelang sie wieder und wieder aufzuziehen

1746710 he knows a lot about fashion from working as an editor and he definitely wouldnt hold back on telling the girls what he really thinks
1746711 i think brendan would be great he certainly has the experience behind him having worked on youre a star and hed be good fun to work with
1746712 nothing has been confirmed yet i wouldnt like to say i was definitely taking part until the details have been worked out
1746713 its something id be really interested in doing though ive been in the industry a long time i know how it works and i know what it takes to make it to the top
1746714 ive worked closely with most of the big names when i was involved with the miss ireland competition everyone from rosanna davison to jenny lee masterson
1746715 in fact ive probably worked with half the assets modelling agency

1746719 weve been here since this morning im hoping to make a bit of money to pay off my school fees
1746720 this is just my way of showing my support for the olympics
1746721 we wont let the event take place we dont need such a thing in the new federal democratic republic of nepal where women are treated as objects of entertainment
1746722 such contests send the wrong message to society as they emphasise physical beauty rather than intellectual ability
1746723 we had to cancel our programme at the last minute
1746724 experience would be the main thing i feel i can bring to this staff and that experience covers a long range of things ive lived in different parts of the country and had an opportunity to make meaningful contacts in those areas
1746725 ive been able to learn a lot from a lot of successful coaches
1746726 im very happy to be back in the sun belt conference and im even more excited to be in
1746727 its an original way to show our country from a cultural and scientific point of view as well as the nightlife or the attractions on our beaches
1746728 the olympics is a world event and world class architecture has been delivered for that event
1746729 no city in the world in recent times has had so much world class work done
1746730 people are coming here purely to see the new stuff
1746731 beijing has taken a different position showing an interest in the matter of culture and architecture that exceeds the boundaries of commercial and speculative development
1746732 whats happening inside the second ring road the old city is pretty disgraceful
1746733 we have demolished too much too fast and we regret that so much has been torn down
1746734 it is always like that think of the eiffel tower when it was built in paris it caused a lot of controversy

1746737 the headwinds today make this a more challenging fund raising environment
1746738 the results reflect the dire environment that these guys are trying to perform in

1746742 beijings major pollutants nitrogen oxides sulphur dioxide suspended particulate matter dust less than ten micrometres diameter ozone and carbon monoxide come from vehicle exhaust factories and construction sites and volatile organic compounds vocs mainly come from gas stations
1746743 vehicle emissions contribute 60 to 70 per cent of air pollution in beijing and these pollutants usually stay in the air for three to four days
1746744 if air pollution is to reach an alarming level often triggered by extreme weather conditions such as high temperatures high humidity and no wind emergency plans will start including pulling more cars off road or shutting down more factories
1746745 about 70 per cent of the devices used in the monitoring network were developed domestically including the equipment that measures pollutants such as nitric oxide carbon monoxide methane ammonia and vocs
1746746 we do not lack talents or technology but policy support
1746747 when the chinese undertake this enormous change in their emissions it will send a signal to the united states that the control of air pollution in one part of the world can in fact affect the atmosphere on the other side of the globe
1746748 the scientific community should plan immediately to take advantage of this monumental experiment mobilising to measure the effect by studying pollution levels before during and after the great shutdown

1746767 davies has been responsible for a large number of public order incidents in the city and despite action being taken against him in the past he has not altered this problematic behaviour
1746768 this order will go someway towards helping davies control his actions and giving the people of chester peace of mind
1746769 we are pleased that the matter has been resolved although the whole incident has caused a great deal of hardship for our members
1746770 i have to say that taking magic mushrooms has been one of the most intense experiences in my life and the most life changing i didnt know that what life was all about till i did my first trip i could see so much more like air particles new colours out of the spectrum our eyes can normally see i felt like doors were being opened inside my brain allowing me to think and percieve in so many ways i never thought possible i felt an understanding of life and the universe and everything and everything made sense for the trip on mushrooms i seemed to have the intellegence and ability to comprehend and understand why we are here and what life was i found out who i was and that not only am i me but i am also everything i could feel as if i was everyone and everything all at the same time and percieved myself in everything and everyone all at the same time like i had tapped into universal consiousness and felt such a strong oneness as if i saw god not as a person but as a united harmonic feeling of oneness of everything

1746772 she wanted to sort of encourage our member municipalities to chip in and think of ways to save energy and be more sustainable

1746775 if they see us doing this that may encourage them to do some things as well

1746790 as banking technology evolves and people have to remember more passwords and pins many of us now prefer to keep things simple and use one provider that they can trust to provide good value across the board
1746791 its worth noting though that those with one password for all their accounts should take care to ensure that this is as secure as possible using a combination of letters and numbers wherever feasible pin numbers should be shielded and of course should never be written down

1746795 during the 1980s breeding and the fur industry generally were defamed by a well organised campaign for animal rights which promoted the synthetic petroleum fur
1746796 it was proven that their motivation was not so innocent since the campaign misinformed people about the origin and treatment of animals and in many cases was founded by competitive industries mink intended for fur is only a product of breeding and the animals are not brutalised at any point their sacrifice causes less suffering than that of many other species used by the food and clothing industries
1746797 this is due to the fact that leather prices are connected to international trade and thus they are very sensitive
1746798 in 1997 98 the devaluation of the russian rouble pushed local producers into serious recession they had expected a good year and had expanded businesses by borrowing a lot
1746799 china begun producing fur some years ago without developing a sector from scratch instead it imported technology scientists and the know how straight from finland

1746838 tonight 200 000 men and women who wore our uniform proudly and served this country courageously as veterans will go to sleep under bridges and on grates
1746839 why dont you try changing positions with one of them bill
1746840 yes im a vietnam veteran i stepped on a land mine
1746841 you know that talk show host bill oreilly he says you dont exist that there are no vets sleeping under bridges
1746842 you can go right down there tonight and see them they gave me some blankets but it gets cold
1746843 when i was first interrogated and really had to give some information because of the pressures the physical pressures that were on me i named the starting lineup defensive line of the pittsburgh steelers as my squadron mates
1746844 having jen may join our staff is tremendous for our program
1746845 though we will miss her leadership and competitive spirit on the field having her on the sidelines will be a fantastic asset to the team she has been part of this program from its inaugural year bringing a wealth of knowledge from the student athlete perspective and this will be invaluable in our recruiting efforts and direction for the program
1746846 brad the tall kid with the hair that never has seen a comb hes amazing able to fly strong tough all that superman crap
1746847 the little girl with the lightshow shes got a lot of potential especially if she can learn to focus to a laser and that fat kid with the stretching they havent worked it out yet but hes almost indestructible
1746848 and you figure just because you can only move little things with your mind that youre nothing compared to them thats what they think out there too
1746849 youre the most powerful of them all add them all together and they dont come close to you
1746850 you think telekinesis is grabbing something with your mind and moving it around
1746851 yeah i know thats what the guys in the lab coats told you their problem is they are inside a box of presumptions and havent peeked out
1746852 they think of telekinesis as an extra set of hands you grab and move things remotely with it but the same way as with your fingers thats not what happens at all they are adding a step to the process
1746853 when you kick a ball you are imparting kinetic energy into it
1746854 and that momentum transfers into the ball causing it to move at slightly slower speed than your leg
1746855 you are upset because you can only move small things you feel weak your power isnt the problem the problem is your energy
1746856 you cant create energy from nothing it has to come from somewhere and it doesnt come from you yes you get a little tired from moving things but thats from concentration no different than becoming tired from reading or studying
1746857 all around you things are in motion the air moves around you from the ventilation system people walk by vibrations from machinery distant cars and footsteps make objects shake slightly sounds shake things around them
1746858 youre pulling some of that energy around you and using it to move things you are simply transferring some of the kinetic energy from your environment and putting it into an object the way you wish it to move you can use that to protect yourself by pulling the kinetic energy out of an object or part of object it will stop and cannot harm you then
1746859 stop this book from reaching you dont grab it like before in the test room ignore that crap its too slow and youll take a hit trying to find it and isolate it to stop just drain the energy from the object as it comes close
1746860 see how the pages didnt flap the book didnt snap shut it just stopped like a video you paused
1746861 nice job liquids are tough because youre thinking of it wrong think of it as a whole a unit rather than parts see how the glass picked up condensation like it came out of a freezer thats another secret that takes longer to explain basically youre pulling the heat energy out of the object careful with that you can kill someone very quickly by doing it
1746862 heres the big secret though cat the trick that makes you more powerful that makes you scary heres what the lab guys dont need to know
1746863 the continents we are on are drifting at a few millimeters a year or more even inches

1746875 under the auspices that such contraception is a form of abortion the purpose of the draft rule is to pre empt state laws that have protected womens ability to get birth control at pharmacies where a particular pharmacist refuses to fill these prescriptions
1746876 around two months ago under arab auspices and with the support of lebanons brothers and friends we reached an exceptional agreement that was highly necessary for that exceptional period
1746877 the doha agreement affirmed that all sides should abide by the principles and rules of the lebanese constitution and the taef agreement and backed the call for a national dialogue headed by the president with the participation of the arab league over the mechanisms to reinforce the authority of the lebanese state on its territories and its relations with various groups on the lebanese lands in what secures the safety of the state and the citizens
1746878 our government whose ratio of representation we agreed in doha and which we pledged not to resign from or hinder its performance is committed to implement this agreement fully and unequivocally
1746879 therefore the lebanese people are hoping that our alliance in this government the government of unanimous national will will be a way to exit this crisis and avoid the threats of estrangement towards rapprochement calm and open dialogue over the great national choices that preserve lebanon and safeguard the freedom of its citizens their security and rights
1746880 they are the choices that entrench lebanons unity underpin its coexistence and preserve its independence sovereignty democratic regime and its distinguishing characteristics of diversity moderation openness and the sense of belonging to this country and the strong bonds with its expatriate citizens across the world
1746881 the government ensures its adherence to the principle of unity and the supremacy of the state in all the issues pertaining to the general policy of the country in what preserves lebanon and upholds its national sovereignty which is the principle that governs all the clauses of the ministerial statement
1746882 the government also highlights the content of the constitutional oath speech of his eminence the president of the republic namely the approaches and calls for dialogue and adherence to the constitution the national agreement and the national agreement pact end of the introduction
1746883 our government corroborates its commitment to implement all the articles of the taef agreement
1746884 the governments efforts come in light of its awareness that the huge events witnessed in our country over the last years and months and weeks and the wounds and fears of the lebanese people require from us to abandon violence the violence of arms and threats and instigation
1746885 abandoning violence represents a double responsibility in referring to the constitution and laws and institutions and respecting the rules of the lebanese political regime on the one hand and dealing with others respectfully with the spirit of genuine partnership and seeking to achieve the public interests and keeping disagreements in their original place so they do not turn into rifts or destructive struggles on the other hand
1746886 the lebanese people sense the threats that engulf their country and they are worried about their security and future while at the same time they are suffering from social economic and financial impacts that have accumulated over the past difficult years witnessed in lebanon
1746887 the government is also committed to designing a doable action program and implementing it upon which we will be held to account by the parliament and lebanese public opinion
1746888 the government stresses the fact that preparing for the coming parliamentary election is at the top of its responsibilities but this does not mean that the logic of struggle and competition in political action and electoral activity will overshadow its resolutions and the jobs of its ministers
1746889 the government is also committed to conducting parliamentary elections punctually according to the new electoral law that will be ratified by the parliament consistent with the doha agreement regarding the division of constituencies and based on the reformative suggestions mentioned by the national committee for the electoral law
1746890 security issues in lebanon still require redoubled efforts from the state to protect the lebanese from assassinations and terrorism and to safeguard civil peace away from violence with all means within reach
1746891 it is the duty of the state not to overlook any attempts to play with peace or security and to put an end for mobile explosions and tensions regardless of their reasons and pretexts which threaten civil peace and crack national unity
1746892 it is the duty of the government and the right of the lebanese to fight all sorts of terrorism and to hinder it from endangering lebanons stability
1746893 today we should reinforce confidence in the legitimate armed forces and offer them political support so they fulfill their role in a way that reassures the lebanese who should feel that these forces guarantee their right to security and protect them from any aggression
1746894 at the arab level our government will work hard to reinforce the relations with arab brothers and entrench the bonds that link us out of our belief in the necessity to activate joint arab action in the framework of the arab league
1746895 while the government ensures lebanons adherence to the legitimate national and arab rights in the face of israel and its aggressions it stresses the arab solidarity apart from the policy of axes to adhere to lebanons higher interest and that of the arabs
1746896 the government looks forward to building unsurpassed relations with fraternal syria on the basis of mutual respect for the sovereignty and independence of both countries and the trust and fraternal bonds
1746897 based on the states responsibility to preserve the sovereignty and independence and unity of lebanon and the wellbeing of its territories and in line with the constitution the government lays emphasis on the following
1746898 first the right of the lebanese people army and resistance to liberate the israeli occupied shebaa farms kafar shuba hills and the lebanese section of ghajar village and defend the country using all legal and possible means
1746899 second the commitment of the government to unscr 1701 with all its clauses
1746900 based on the national agreement pact announced in taef which stipulated that the state spreads its control over all the lebanese territories and stressed the need that the palestinian brothers living in lebanon should respect the states authority and laws the government will work in line with what the national dialogue committee unanimously agreed upon and will put an end to the palestinian arms outside the camps and resolve the issue of security and arms inside the camps
1746901 it also underscores its responsibility and commitment to protect the palestinian camps from any assault
1746902 lebanons foreign policy stems from the unanimous national will and the duty to defend lebanons rights and interests and characteristics and the responsibility of restoring its active role in the arab world and the international community
1746903 this policy is also based on lebanons commitment to the charter of the arab league and the united nations and its concern about joint arab action and international cooperation
1746904 in this context the government will endeavor to gain wider support for the election of lebanon as a non permanent member in the un security council for the years 2010 and 2011
1746905 the government will strengthen the capacities of lebanese diplomacy through training and modernizing the working methods so it fulfills its role to the best in developing the economic political and cultural relations with the world and defending lebanons causes and interests and enhancing its presence in international and regional forums and meetings and in the media 34
1746906 the governments efforts at the level of social and economic policies will focus on three major points
1746907 second enhancing the target and efficiency of social services offered by the state to the citizens and developing social support programs for marginalized and needy groups
1746908 first the government is committed to continue implementing the economic revival program and speeding up sustainable development in what matched the capacities of the lebanese economy and contributes to enhancing its productivity

1746915 en cuanto a la comisi n de fiscalizaci n tanto el nacionalismo como el fujimorismo pretenden liderar o presidir esta comisi n pero upp ha desempe ado un trabajo eficiente y nosotros pensamos mantener

1746920 tenemos aproximadamente una inversi n de 255 millones de soles a la fecha pero el proceso es bastante lento
1746921 hemos entregado aproximadamente 6 mil bonos por un monto de 36 millones de soles y 9 mil t tulos de propiedad de los 20 mil que necesitamos entregar porque el gran problema de la reconstrucci n es el saneamiento f sico y legal de las 20 mil casas ca das ya que 16 mil no tienen ning n tipo de documentaci n
1746922 tenemos que pensar que el d a 15 es un d a para reflexionar pensar y meditar lo que ha pasado en la provincia de pisco no estoy de acuerdo con las medidas que se quieren tomar
1746923 es un hecho que el per est progresando y eso es muy positivo y creo que hay que reconocerlo es muy importante que la estabilidad que ahora existe y la continuidad de esas pol ticas que nos est n trayendo beneficios se mantengan
1746924 ese crecimiento hay que procurar que llegue de una manera m s homog nea al conjunto del pa s y sobre todo a los sectores que est n muy marginados donde hay todav a mucha frustraci n porque muchos peruanos sienten que los beneficios de este crecimiento no les llega

1746935 i keep telling him he has to believe in himself more because he has everything just like phil jagielka
1746936 i want to know why the spanish are eating so many undersized fish from populations that are running out
1746937 agreements and deals brokered by politicians will never be satisfactory they always look for the short term fix
1746938 is that often for less threatened species like mackerel or whiting they have set quotas 100 higher than the science recommended so in their efforts to pacify the industry they are bringing populations that could be sustainably fished into the risk zone
1746939 and some of its contracting parties pervert the spirit of it to ensure their overfishing of tuna continues
1746940 iccat doesnt do what it says it does it doesnt conserve instead it presides over the decline and collapse of tuna stocks
1746941 the atlantic bluefin fishery is unsustainable in every way economically socially and ecologically
1746942 but the fishing fleet keeps getting bigger there are six new reefers large tuna catching boats linked to the japanese in the region i think the fishing industry is starting to feel really hijacked by the japanese
1746943 if you announce as iccat did two years ago an emergency fisheries recovery plan then you are telling the concerned public that something is being done about the problem
1746944 but it isnt the fisheries recovery plan is a misnomer
1746945 the cost according to a 2004 survey would be between 7 billion us 13 9 billion and 8 2 billion us 16 3 billion a year after set up but put that against the 17 6 billion us 34 8 billion a year we currently spend on harmful subsidies that encourage overfishing
1746946 the model of industry political control for regulatory bodies just doesnt work its like central banks put them under politicians control and they make dangerous short term decisions that result in economic instability put them under independent control and they make better judged more strategic decisions
1746947 it is awful and we are on the road to disaster
1746948 but the collapse in some not all the situations is still reversible and its worth trying

1746951 para m el n mero uno es un triunfo bonito pero no tengo tiempo de disfrutarlo porque estoy en los juegos y esta es una experiencia nica y ahora s lo pienso en intentar hacerlo lo mejor posible

1746954 ojal podamos seguir con el nivel del a o pasado peleando con los mejores que creo que es el objetivo aunque los equipos nos van a tener un poco mas en cuenta
1746955 ya llevamos tiempo entrenando lo f sico ya se ha acabado y ahora vamos a estar con el grupo normal y poco a poco entraremos en los partidos cogiendo el ritmo que tiene todo el equipo y con ganas de entrar ya con ellos porque desde fuera es peor
1746956 creo que tenemos una gran plantilla muchos jugadores en todas las posiciones

1747033 right now we have over 12 million users in over 26 countries with 240 million in xbox live marketplace transactions revenue so far with 180 million in the last 12 months alone
1747034 on average titles that have downloadable content on xbl marketplace have seen a 16 percent longer period of people holding onto that title which keeps them from selling to secondhand stores

1747039 i think halo has always been an extremely simulation driven game
1747040 simulation i think adds replayability it adds depth to the game but it also makes scripting much more difficult and it means designers have a much harder time

1747043 there are no other changes or enhancements in this update in other words no new features
1747044 we have announced to our staff and key stakeholders that we are investigating a possible sale of our assets and operations in the south west pacific
1747045 the decision to investigate this option resulted from a number of approaches made to bp by different organisations in past months
1747046 all expressed interest in buying our ground and air bp assets and operations to grow their presence in the south west pacific
1747047 while we have always invested in the business to ensure its ongoing operational success we appreciate the investment demands on the business are growing as the business grows this is a good time to consider whether we are the best organisation to take this business through its next stage of development
1747048 when parliament works by providing the opposition with a voice and a fair chance to influence the policies and events of the day then the democratic process works
1747049 so it is imperative that we help to create strong and enduring democratic institutions
1747050 these institutions have to be nurtured supported and strengthened in the right spirit
1747051 this is the type of model we need to emulate and support everywhere through developing parliamentary procedures respecting constitutional governance and promoting a culture of participation
1747052 the communal system of representation entrenches inequality by not providing one value for one vote and has contributed to the coup culture and the consequent ethnic based politics that has impeded our national development
1747053 we acknowledge that democracy is more than just a matter of voting
1747054 effective democratic governance must place the people at the centre
1747055 we therefore affirm our commitment to secure a more transparent and accountable process of government
1747056 the peoples eyes are the eyes of the nation their ears are the ears of the nation and their voice the voice of the nation
1747057 to perfect democratic governance in fiji we the people must be free to see hear and to speak on the affairs of our country
1747058 some of the issues to be discussed will be the posting of ministers but this will also depend once the agenda proper is set
1747059 they have their name tags in the room even though they are not here and we hope they will be part of the electoral reform forum under the un and commonwealth office
1747060 we have tended to focus on the differences that divide us rather than on our common shared values and interests
1747061 we must change for our common good as one nation and as one people through our shared vision and values for a common national destiny
1747062 i am sure it contains good things because it includes issues such as an electoral reform which we all want
1747063 but it will be interesting to see how the regime will legalise the charter because we have a constitution
1747064 if external parties come in it would be good because we do not have enough resources
1747065 through dialogue we hope political parties will reach a consensus
1747066 i have worked in vietnam for three and a half years which is a communist country but at the grassroot levels democracy existed
1747067 and despite continuous efforts put in by the previous governments the problem has continued to stare at us in the face so the charter will not make a difference said mr namudu
1747068 in fact it will not solve any problem of school dropouts
1747069 the regime is doing the total opposite to what they are saying about improving education and providing quality education to the students of fiji
1747070 while talking about quality education the regime has asked the ministry of education to decrease its 2009 budget and that does not speak one word of improving education for our children at all
1747071 some experts have termed this trait as the handout mentality which unfortunately was propagated through the mode and nature of government intervention from before independence
1747072 major issues that emerged from the taskforce findings included fiji losing its preferential access for garments to the us problems of economic management with past elected governments low investment trends and unemployment and underemployment
1747073 this not only includes updating archaic laws and regulations but also improving services such as computerisation of registries
1747074 i hope to build on my self confidence become a more confident person and hope to meet a lot of interesting people
1747075 the hibiscus to me means to have fun and i will be out there to enjoy as much as i can

1747092 as we have observed throughout the last several years the notion of fairness in journalism has been guided by a miscalculated rule that in order to report good news about a liberal or a liberal success news reporting has to be counterbalanced either with unearned praise for conservatives or trumped up and parroted negative news about the aforementioned liberal or liberal success oh and the reverse doesnt apply thats the rule
1747093 its not only obamas youth eloquence and energy that have stolen hearts across the atlantic obama has raised expectations of a chance for the nation to redeem itself
1747094 lenders ignored the warning signs because they were part of a system built around the principle of heads i win tails someone else loses mortgage originators didnt worry about the solvency of borrowers because they quickly sold off the loans they made generally to investors who had no idea what they were buying throughout the financial industry executives received huge bonuses when they seemed to be earning big profits but didnt have to give the money back when those profits turned into even bigger losses

1747103 in the meantime wealth advisers are steering donors away from fractional giving and toward an array of other complex art giving vehicles such as charitable remainder trusts and donor advised funds
1747104 its you know its a temptation to let the politics at home get in the way you know with the considered judgment of the commanders
1747105 and so i would ask whoever goes there every elected official who goes there to listen carefully to what is taking place and understand that the best way to go forward is to listen to the parties who are actually on the ground
1747106 it cant be overstated how much of an awkward position the mccain team has been put in by maliki by sticking to their position on an indefinite u s presence they now appear willing to remain in iraq against the stated wishes of the iraqi government if thats what it comes to
1747107 senator obamas timetable of removing u s troops from iraq within that 16 month period seemed to be getting a thumbs up by the iraqi prime minister when he called it the right timeframe for a withdrawal he has backed off that somewhat but the iraqis have not stopped using the word timetable so if the iraqi government were to say if you were president we want a timetable for troops being to removed would you agree with that

1747110 mccains mistakes raise a serious if uncomfortable question are the gaffes the result of his age
1747111 youve got probably the best example you could possibly see on two different commanders in chief and john mccain and barrack obama and how they would have handled a really difficult situation and the one produced success and the surge and the other would have in all likelihood produced massive failure and expansion of terrorism globally
1747112 i think that theres been an artificial construct thats been created where you essentially have two choices either i am so rigid and stubborn that i ignore anything that happens during the course of the 16 months in which our plan is being implemented or alternatively i just have an indefinite open ended commitment that is never driven by clear a clear timetable or a set of goals
1747113 and i reject that that those are the only two options
1747114 ive also said in the past this is not new that if for example you started seeing a resurgence of ethnic violence that was that presented the possibility of genocide that i would always reserve the right as commander in chief to intervene hopefully with the international community
1747115 so facts have to affect your decision making and you know over the course of 16 months things are going to constantly change
1747116 i had the courage and the judgment to say that i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war it seems to me that senator obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign

1747119 see shes an actor and so there are actual literal clowns around but not circus clowns and the clowns are like an insult that shes saying to herself
1747120 for one thing we dont have big giant heads we arent gray we arent most of us only four feet tall and god how i wish skinny nor do we have only four fingers and those huge giants eyes
1747121 hes not as geeky as the rest of your friends
1747122 everything can be taken from man but one thing the last of human freedoms to choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances
1747123 what was your role in the attorney general firings and what did you tell the president
1747124 mudge since youve been around for some 900 plus years you must have been in those parts do you have any recommendations for hot tourist spots in panspermia
1747125 you must be a t you have such t eyes oh i knew your mother in high school and your gr grandfather farmed a quarter section near my uncle wiggie
1747126 you must be dr gs son you look just like him
1747127 the candidate who started out talking about high minded civil debate has wholeheartedly adopted mr roves low minded and uncivil playbook
1747128 this isnt political im supporting our brave men and women
1747129 hes been out of the navy almost as long as ive been out of the army im a great grandfather what do i know about todays soldiers
1747130 in dr johnsons famous dictionary patriotism is defined as the last resort of a scoundrel with all due respect to an enlightened but inferior lexicographer i beg to submit that it is the first

1747132 whenever you hear a man speak of his love for his country it is a sign that he expects to be paid for it
1747133 this is nothing more than a political stunt to divert attention from the high gas prices that have resulted from having two oil men in the white house
1747134 why gun owners have male pattern baldness even the chicks
1747135 we sent the puppy off to live on a farm

1747137 at bazaar were so into politics and we had this idea to cast ourselves a phenomenal new first lady
1747138 so what gives me tears is if barack obama wins kids are going to say that a black man can be president too
1747139 with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning
1747140 how much coverage do think the media has given each candidate
1747141 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is
1747142 and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1747143 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism
1747144 i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1747145 well you know im spoken for so i think it has nothing to do with that at all and never did whatever im a huge supporter
1747146 lasted approximately four and a half hours including recovery and he is in good spirits and was visiting with family members this morning

1747150 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely
1747151 it was so bad i couldnt tell what it was
1747152 watching television about 11 15 and i heard a car sliding on the highway out in front of our house
1747153 as i looked out the window i saw it began to flip after it hit our next door neighbors drive it went end over end about twice and then it came back on its wheels in the ditch it was a mess
1747154 he whispered into her ear and she listened with rapt attention he brushed his hand on her back they had nice chemistry

1747164 our next steps are to go after these reservoirs of hiv and although much work needs to be done to find and eliminate them infected people who have access to antiretroviral drugs and who take them as prescribed stand a good chance of leading normal lives
1747165 adding more drugs to current regimens will not further reduce the amount of virus in the blood
1747166 we have already reached rock bottom in using drugs to stop hiv from replicating the trace amounts of virus that remain are coming from viral reservoirs not active replication of the virus

1747171 gis is an important part of our performance based approach to government
1747172 by analyzing our performance in a geographic context we are able to reduce operating costs increase revenue streams and improve the quality of service we deliver to citizens an efficient government is one that uses resources responsibly and effectively and this approach to operations helps us achieve that
1747173 gis allows leaders to visualize vast amounts of data identify problems and quickly make informed decisions that are critical to an organization
1747174 governor omalley has been an advocate of gis for years and has used gis technology to improve government functions and service we are delighted to have him speak at the seminar
1747175 this is a great opportunity for water executives and managers to not only interact with their local peers but also explore how they can use gis for their daily decisions and long range planning
1747176 they will hear lessons learned at other water utilities see live demonstrations and be able to interact with several esri business partners during our solutions fair
1747177 microsoft and esri have a long standing history of delivering complete geographic information systems solutions
1747178 the integration of virtual earth and arcgis 9 3 at both desktop application and platform levels enables customers to better view analyze understand interpret and visualize geographic data this new offering further extends the software plus services choices available to our mutual customers

1747184 until the 1970s the editors were picked on the basis of grades and the president of the law review was the student with the highest academic rank deletions that system came under attack in the 1970s and was replaced by a program in which about half the editors are chosen for their grades and the other half are chosen by fellow students after a special writing competition the new system disputed when it began was meant to help insure that minority students became editors of the law review harvard like a number of other top law schools no longer ranks its law students for any purpose including a guide to recruiters
1747185 certainly it seems quite valid to make a distinction between most
1747186 and finally i just learned how much of the worlds investment capital is held by pension funds and similar workers retirement plans thirty trillion dollars that is more than a third of the amount currently invested in available investment equities including the stock of nearly all corporations in other words the workers already own the means of production wrap your heads around that one then discuss why they arent using that ownership power
1747187 standing in the cafeteria line should be a formative experience
1747188 criminals can now operate from almost anywhere on the global to steal personal information from almost anywhere on the globe
1747189 obviously we werent happy that someone we had working for us as an informant was double dealing
1747190 the sheer number of retailers attacked by these cyber criminals demonstrates the much broader challenges in protecting sensitive consumer data from this increasing threat
1747191 rather than locking every single door lets get all the safes
1747192 not that we dont want to lock the doors but if that worked then we wouldnt be in this mess

1747195 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1747196 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1747197 were just recently very recently engaged so you know were just taking it easy and no big plan yet but its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged
1747198 they told me in court that there were rumours of a prison breakout and they had both been shifted to naboro as a security measure
1747199 she says that the offences are serious and that the information discloses serial violent offending
1747200 they are both charged with multiple counts of robbery with violence damaging property and act with intent to cause grievous harm two of the counts on the information are in relation to attacks on police officers or police property
1747201 as far as their incarceration is concerned it is clear that not all the remand prisoners have been shifted to the naboro prison
1747202 it appears that the shifting of these accused was done as an internal temporary security measure and that it is a matter in relation to which the court hearing a bail application has no business interfering with
1747203 as i have said where the commissioner of prisons decides to put his prisoners and remandees is a matter for him
1747204 you are a servant and in a position of trust by the fiji school of medicine

1747206 each passenger would have to pay 50 if they are found without a ticket
1747207 the same goes for a bus driver who will pay 50 for every passenger he fails to provide a ticket to
1747208 from what bus operators say we were quite sure there was some leakage in that area and for that there is a need to assess this very crucial area
1747209 the papers were easy and i am confident of doing well in my marks and i just want it to finish
1747210 i have been studying hard for the past three months and i am positive of producing good marks in all my papers i cant wait for tomorrow and am looking forward to taking a good break
1747211 intelligence focal point for the gathering of required geoint source data and the production of the ussocom common database in support of the sof mission and training preparation systems mtps
1747212 we spend a lot of time and effort in developing high resolution elevation data colorizing imagery and digitizing and conflating the vector feature data to correlate with the imagery
1747213 turnaround time is too long current time from collection to product generation can be anywhere from 30 to 90 days
1747214 this prevents large size areas from ever being created it is just too cumbersome
1747215 with unconstrained freedom of movement our customers can fly through or drive on 3 d terrain with a 200 km far horizon while maintaining a rate of 60 frames per second
1747216 its based on the esri arcgis platform which provides a great deal of built in support for nearly any kind of geospatial data out there
1747217 since this terrain generation capability is integrated with the tools that most customers are probably already using to manage their geospatial data assets our terrain tools extension enables them to leverage these assets more effectively for the creation of high fidelity virtual environments
1747218 ground level environments were generally small in geographic coverage with a greater amount of cultural content such as buildings trees and other features aerial environments were optimized for flying at a high altitude over greater distances with expansive geographic coverage but little to no ground level cultural content
1747219 we have to make the experience of a dismounted soldier looking at a building from a meter away just as realistic as the view from a uav looking at the same building from thousands of meters in the air all within the same virtual environment
1747220 in constructing such an environment we must bridge the gap between the super highresolution ground level source data photographs survey data and the lower resolution remotely sensed data aerial and satellite photography and digital elevation models and make the transition between these data types believable
1747221 the cga provides a set of all the standard national geospatial intelligence agency worldwide data sets raster product format vector product format and digital terrain elevation data along with some interesting commercial data such as natural vue 2000 and the nasa 90 meter worldwide data elevation model
1747222 what this means is that units involved in modeling and simulation will have unprecedented user friendly easy to access worldwide geospatial data at global strategic tactical and urban scales to support training and simulation exercises as well as actual operations
1747223 most current cgf applications utilize one of the common simulation terrain database representations such as openflight compact terrain databases and others these database formats having been derived from the classic visual simulation tool chain are not generally correlated with the geospatial data used by c2 and analysis systems this lack of correlation can produce serious anomalies in the simulation results
1747224 because of this there will be degradation in speed of the simulation in comparison to current real time optimized database formats streaming of just in time geospatial data will also prove a challenge as compared to off line production and execution of static optimized databases
1747225 this is a terrain processing layer inside vr forces that simulates on top of the native geospatial data not a derived visual format
1747226 as vr forces is simulating on top of the exact same geospatial database that is used in the corresponding c2 system the anomalies due to a lack of correlation are eliminated
1747227 were in the process of finalizing our vr forces roadmap for 2009 and are working on a firm release date for the gems features
1747228 these ortho mosaics and 3 d site models provide increased situational awareness and meet the operational needs of warfighters
1747229 sand tables have been a staple for military training and mission rehearsal since the invention of sand there is something about having a single stable reference terrain that allows groups of people to focus on the mission rather than how they should interpret a flat map
1747230 the models are computer numeric control cut from a solid foam block according to the digital elevation model then printed with map graphics aerial imagery or a combination of both
1747231 the model gives everyone a view of the area of interest and supports multiple conversations simultaneously unlike a computer generated view which forces everyone to look at the scene from the same position and angle the models may be of any size and virtually any scale for which data is available
1747232 one thing that we are actively pursuing in geospatial r amp d that will have a significant impact on modeling and simulation is the value of having a common battle management language bml
1747233 we think that the evolving capability of bml represents a key technology that can potentially unite the disparate systems involved in battle management particularly bml has the potential to create realistic train as you fight modeling and simulation capability we are also interested in how the geospatial component of bml or geobml will evolve as a subset and in parallel with bml

1747239 given the significant uncertainty on the date for completion of our proceeding after issuance of the stbs time limits decision and the fact that u s steel has read the stock purchase agreement to require that this transaction close by dec 31 cn contacted u s steel last week to formally request an extension of the deadline
1747240 us steel is prepared to co operate with cn towards the goal of closing the transaction in 2008 but it will not agree to extend the deal therefore we need a decision in this case and we have decided to seek legal relief to allow cn to close on the transaction prior to dec 31
1747241 the public interest calls for the stb to complete its review of the transaction and should it be approved to serve a decision that would allow the transaction to close by the end of the year
1747242 this transaction would not simply benefit cn and its customers this transaction is in the broader regional and national interest
1747243 shifting cns trains to the underutilized ej amp e line would bring benefits for millions of residents in downtown chicago while also streamlining rail operations

1747253 we are very grateful for the tremendous start we had in this game
1747254 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states

1747268 whilst transaction activity has shown a marked decline from the historical highs achieved over the last two years we are still cautiously optimistic about the future of hotel investments over the medium term
1747269 at 13 9 billion hotel investment volumes are now at a level comparable to that of 2004 which similarly recorded 14 0 billion worth of transactions within the first half of the year
1747270 more importantly transaction volumes are still significantly higher than those achieved in 2002 2003 which remains the lowest point for the industry in this decade
1747271 following the events of september 11 2001 the iraq war and the sars outbreak in 2003 transaction volumes sunk to a low of 3 6 billion in the first half of 2002 and remained weak through the end of 2003 based on year to date numbers the hotel investment market in 2008 appears to be in a much stronger position relative to the 2002 2003 period
1747272 on the other hand with the weaker trading outlook anticipated for most markets sellers are expected to start adjusting to new pricing levels

1747309 the board of lonmin notes the unsolicited pre conditional offer announced this morning by xstrata for the entire issued share capital of lonmin at 3 300 pence per share in cash
1747310 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1747311 lonmins operations have consistently underperformed its own forecasts on expected platinum sales and have been subject to a declining sales and production profile at a time of robust prices
1747312 xstrata believes that lonmins operations are attractive but that a significant transformation of operating and management practices are required to return lonmin to its former growth trajectory over time

1747315 afl will not be in a position to accept the terms and conditions to which it was never a party to and one it will not be able to sustain

1747318 the response has been very good from the public particularly the villagers and we are working on strengthening our network with villagers because it is also an opportunity for them to be examined
1747319 there are some villagers who live in the interior and cannot travel to hospital every week so through this blood donation exercise the villagers are provided an opportunity to receive medical examination and know about their health

1747326 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan

1747332 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers
1747333 the question is not so much about the technology but what one does with it we have quite definite laws about where cctv can be used but of course with uavs you have much greater ability to gather material in private spaces and this would lead to concern

1747336 in the response to our report we expect the mod to set out why it supports the astraea programme only in an observer role and its future plans with regard to this programme
1747337 satellite images can be affected by clouds and lack of light with uavs you can avoid that by choosing the height at which you fly there is now also google earth but these are often old images out of date there is tremendous potential in material gathered by uavs

1747400 usually we may get one or the maximum two usually theres only one wedding on friday most bride and grooms usually prefer to get married on saturday for the convenience of friends relatives and family
1747401 when we set the date they were very ecstatic about it so it made a big difference for them
1747402 there were protests and universities were closed but the tipping point came when ruling gen ne win warned that if demonstrations continued the army would shoot point blank
1747403 it looked as though the whole country had turned out
1747404 the feeling was overwhelming soldiers surrounded everywhere the protests went and they had guns and bayonets people were confused but they were ready for revolution
1747405 around 6 p m we were given a warning by they army they said within five minutes you must go
1747406 there was a lot more hope and optimism in 1988
1747407 but after the brutal crackdown and the fact that the military ignored the outcome of the 1990 election then cracked down on the monks in 1990 as well as 2007 most people seem to have given up hope

1747482 aug 5 is the day that the board of audit and inspection was disgraced
1747483 the lee government refused to guarantee the legal term of the kbs president which is a minimum condition to respect the freedom of the press
1747484 it is degrading kbs into becoming a state run promotion agency
1747485 kbs independence and freedom of the press are being seriously challenged history is apparently going backwards we are witnessing that the democracy and democratic process korea has achieved through a long struggle are being severely compromised
1747486 the audit process was unusually fast as if a scenario to unseat me was set up the auditor unusually demanded that i be directly questioned and it falsely calculated the companys balance to emphasize my so called mismanagement
1747487 the inspection agency not only probed my corruption allegations but also those of other executives even demanding the social security numbers of all 5 300 kbs employees but it found no corruption ironically confirming kbs transparency
1747488 when it comes to the singijeon we have tried to reflect historical facts as much as possible but other elements such as the plot and characters are mostly fictional
1747489 my character is the head of a joseon merchant group but hes not a political figure hes a guy who loves drinking and chasing after girls but he happens to help make the singijeon after he falls in love with hong ri
1747490 in the process of pushing for the secret project hong ri develops a relationship with seol ju and there are some scenes revealing her human side
1747491 i really liked this character because king sejong in the movie uses a cuss word when hes really upset and i think i can understand his feeling even kings may swear if they are pushed into a corner
1747492 when i was reading the script i realized my ignorance about the great weapon we had developed at the same time i felt proud of the historical achievement
1747493 i believe more people should feel the same pride about the singijeon
1747494 out of the top spot signaling that the korean blockbuster is losing momentum after a two week reign at the box office
1747495 is this real or a dream watching them film was very scary
1747496 i really felt like something was going to jump out at me
1747497 because the original broadway show premiered in 1956 people might think its a bit late to stage the show here now but we thought there is definitely a need for classic shows like this
1747498 the show is what everyone grew up with and considered the greatest story in the west with the well made set good music and costumes creating a good harmony
1747499 and the romantic and exciting story is more than just a cinderella story
1747500 playing with korean family structures shows her magic is still alive and strong
1747501 more than a million people watched it in its opening week a movie set during the vietnam war attracted more than 1 and a half million theater goers
1747502 its true there used to be a tendency to rely on a movies scale and cast but the current trend shows whats the most important is the story
1747503 economic slowdowns tend to boost the number of movie goers i think its a crucial time for korean movies
1747504 despite the high quality of work we understand the difficulty of our korean directors in trying to set foot abroad
1747505 look to extensively exhibit and support these animations to try and export them to the world stage
1747506 its a shame that we dont have any anthology drama series with korean ghost stories i hope we can realize the need and importance of these series
1747507 the actors didnt feel any competition there were so many things they had to take care of from costumes special effects to acting their roles but the producers to tell the truth felt hard competition
1747508 the characters and plots didnt really matter but had to be based on korean tradition and during a particular era thus the audience will be able to find many traditional aspects throughout the drama
1747509 it may look old fashioned but i can guarantee that its scary some editors had to stick post its on the screen because it was too hard for them to edit the scenes
1747510 when there are movies people want to watch it draws in more viewers and helps the sales of both hollywood movies and korean ones
1747511 swiri star han seok gyu attracted 1 million viewers its first weekend
1747512 its important to have a good fall winter because that encourages investment in film production the following year
1747513 he did this to himself and now im stuck with his problem
1747514 he tried to persuade the judge in capitol v thomas that the part of the copyright act which says by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending can be disregarded

1747544 and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a non story

1747556 look at the percentage of our prison population that is aboriginal and the sorry history of our residential schools arent our hands as dirty as theirs

1747558 death wish a chilling court appearance by the man accused in a gruesome bus murder
1747559 i dont know what the mounties were up to or why they decided to keep a file on me it could have been fear
1747560 in those days they werent used to women talking about equality subsidized daycare and empowerment
1747561 consisting of about one hundred sweating uncombed women standing around in the middle of the floor with their arms around each other crying sisterhood and dancing
1747562 70 of all cios have identified gis as a strategic it component
1747563 i walked into the orchard and came away with the sweet taste of freedom others talk the orchard does i expect to do great things with them and look forward to my future
1747564 record companies today are taking more rights and a bigger piece of an artists career without regard to the long term relationship with and financial health of their artists
1747565 the orchard has spoken loud and clear about their commitment to doing right by artists and have set the foundation for a positive ongoing relationship with lil jon with this landmark release
1747566 nancy jumped at the chance to take the picture of paul with us
1747567 they told us they were on a trip and going on to st louis before heading west no one could believe that it was really him he was so laid back and ordinary they seemed a great couple
1747568 the road trip was nancys idea as a way of them getting to bond and spending time together just the two of them
1747569 theyve been talking about the holiday non stop and were so excited
1747570 its the perfect way for them to both get away from it all and really get to know each other paul even packed his guitar
1747571 that is the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard it would never happen my dad would never dream of doing that
1747572 im the first to admit the last few weeks have been crazy but im not out of control i do need to get out of london for a while and relax clear my head and sort things out
1747573 we did things wed never done before like being in the same room doing vocals shouting at each other in a nice way
1747574 marks main thing is songs hes old fashioned famed producer phil spector style sometimes hed make us all wear sunglasses in the studio
1747575 i know it sounds stupid but we did new track good days bad days and wearing sunglasses on it gave it a really different vibe

1747579 taylor considers it an honor that if elected she will be the 1st openly gay african american legislator in the united states if you will go to the www victoryfund com website you will see that they are excited about the same and working strategically to ensure that this candidate wins the election who would she be representing those that fund her from the east coast or 84th district is this what we want to be known for in kansas in wichita
1747580 we plan for and expect openly gay candidates will face attacks from right wing bigots not democratic party officials this is divisive gutter politics at its worst and gail finney should be ashamed of herself
1747581 she found it early shes going to get through the treatment and shell be okay she needs to say i have an illness i have to treat it and be good to my body and not over stress myself and then shell get well
1747582 to be on the show and to hear other people its comforting to be around other people whove been through it this feeling of community is really the vibe of the show
1747583 i hope applegate feels it we are all there for her now and know what shes going through were all thinking of her and praying for her
1747584 it is apparent that defendants use of the cartier tank trademark in connection with watches is willful and intentional and done in willful disregard of cartiers rights
1747585 i am delighted that we have reached this agreement with the very prestigious donna karan international part of the louis vuitton group and that we will have the opportunity to expand our business in the highly lucrative far east and middle east markets
1747586 this joint venture agreement reflects our ongoing commitment to expanding our mens product lines and marks the next step in the evolution of our business
1747587 they couldnt push vouchers through the legislature in an above board way so they went through the back door to divert public dollars to private school programs
1747588 given the finite pool of money available for dropout recovery and the pressing needs in our state diverting public money to private educational programs clearly shortchanges public schools that need it and could effectively use it
1747589 we need to be marshalling all our forces to respond to it its incredible that tsta thinks that nonprofit organizations dont have a role to play in reducing the dropout problem and increasing the graduation rate

1747609 we will provide all the technical detail necessary for these protection providers to very quickly develop signatures and updated protections for those vulnerabilities
1747610 the reality is that at 10 a m on patch tuesday the bad guys start reverse engineering
1747611 but as for the really bad exploitable stuff the bad guys are going to figure out which ones those are on their own very easily anyways
1747612 as long as i work for microsoft we will not pay for bugs
1747613 i believe part of my job in working with the security research community was to figure out how to engage that community in a positive way
1747614 microsoft has a lot of assets and we provide attribution in our bulletins thats an asset that we have and are willing to use
1747615 think of all the clueless people who go through the airport and connect to free wi fi
1747616 there are a lot of companies that work in hardening their security
1747617 but some vendors dont care they do security when someone finds the problem
1747618 in the case of os x we are using an exploit that was patched
1747619 in the case of itunes apple implemented a stronger update process
1747620 if i cant trust the vendor for automatic software updates who can i trust
1747621 ultimately the judge in this case was sending a message that this is the type of crime that is going to come with severe punishment attached

1747628 the majority of these attacks are using web properties as repositories for malware mainly because they let users upload content
1747629 websense has found that the content of a single web page may be comprised from multiple locations including a variety of disparate sources the danger is that users typically associate the content they are viewing from the url in the address bar not the actual content source the url is no longer an accurate representation of the source content from the web page can help people searching the web determine whether the sites they are searching for have a nasty reputation but such services do little to aid in flagging legitimate sites that were recently hacked and seeded with malicious software noscript
1747630 i have seen already code that is geared at exploiting this out in the wild and im not even looking for it
1747631 oddly after i set this to always use https today the taskbar notifier has stopped working saying
1747632 i just did a check turned off the https setting and the gmail notifier starts working immediately
1747633 i usually leave ie at high settings since i dont routinely use it i tried reducing all the security settings in firefox to make sure it wasnt the cause and the problem exists without using
1747634 starting in firefox 3 downloads of executable files e g exe or msi may fail and the firefox downloads window will contain this message under the filename
1747635 in some cases this may cause a substantial delay in saving the downloaded file
1747636 if you dont like something in firefox download the source and compile it yourself im sick of people complaining about stuff like this on firefox and other open source software but do nothing about it its really not that hard to change a line or two of code and recompile
1747637 but the bottom line is whether firefox is really more secure than ie
1747638 it seems to be a deliberate improper use of the emblem
1747639 greyhound knows how important it is to get these removed and we are doing everything possible
1747640 this is something that we immediately asked to be done last week realizing that these could be offensive
1747641 the reaper as a close air support asset expands beyond the concept of persistent stare to one of persistent strike if the ground commander wants us to strike an enemy target we can do that with precision weapons from the reaper at the exact point where the ground commander wants a desired effect its an incredibly powerful and flexible capability for the warfighting commander
1747642 it is out of the question to raise sales taxes on food products even more so given the difficult context of the french populations purchasing power
1747643 it is subscribing to something i regard not to be science
1747644 if conventional doping testing were to be submitted to a regulatory agency such as the u s food and drug admin istration to qualify as a diagnostic test for a disease it would be rejected
1747645 this is a black box with little people running around and we do not know what they are doing this area needs some fresh air it is just anti science not only in its conduct but in its attitude
1747646 it seems like a closed process by which they set these things up they say if somebody is above a certain range the chance of a false positive is one in a billion but you never see the data to support that
1747647 the detection methods undergo rigorous validation prior to being introduced this reliability has been consistently confirmed by tribunals
1747648 it would be useful and very valuable but very expensive
1747649 within a month thered be a book published on how to beat standardized testing procedures
1747650 we have a group of people trying to circumvent testing its unlike any other field i can think of
1747651 the whole testing operation benefits from involvement of first rate scientists and the critique scientists can give
1747652 when i see things i do not agree with i sometimes pass it off but if it affects people it bothers me it eats at me
1747653 recognizing the crap i will go through this is worth it to me we all want to make a difference

1747658 ladies may need to squat because toilets are often in the ground and those toilets may smell unlike anything youve experienced before bring small packs of tissues because theres rarely toilet paper in the bathrooms
1747659 it is true that theres a lot of spitting going on today i applauded a man on the street who was practicing some martial arts with a type of spear he looked extremely pleased with my praise gave me thumbs up then hawked a loogie
1747660 you risk putting your chinese colleagues friends hosts or acquaintances into a sticky if not risky position if you try to force conversations about controversial political or religious issues dont jeopardize someone elses freedom in the exercise of ones own
1747661 china has one of the worst records in the world for fatalities per number of vehicles on the road your life is worth more than the embarrassment or the face of a bad driver if you happen to be in a car with one so if you are in a car with a bad driver say that you have a heart problem or are sick and you need them to slow down and drive sanely if language is an issue use sign language ham it up

1747681 the boys have been asking to go so we will take them when knox and viv are a little bit older
1747682 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1747683 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1747684 yet again the march has been marked by attacks against the catholic church mockery of the bishops and slogans against christians
1747685 hurt the feelings of the members of a religious confession
1747686 publicly by word or through any type of document make fun of their dogmas beliefs rites or ceremonies or publicly humiliate those who profess or practice them
1747687 next year there could be changes but ive never seen a car thats fighting at the back one year then sweep the field the next
1747688 its always step by step so its hard to close the gap whether its the aerodynamics the engine or the tires whatever our problems are wed have to work very hard to close that gap
1747689 but to be honest its going to be difficult to move ahead of them top teams and to make a car that will be superior to theirs
1747690 they honda have said a lot of good positive things and i appreciate it
1747691 but im still focused on this year we are not going to throw in the towel we are going to fight until the last lap
1747692 yeah yeah i dont think i would have been second with mclaren
1747693 im saying that based on the last few races of the past season when i was finishing fourth and fifth and thats not what i expected this year im still finishing fourth and fifth but with a team who really want me to achieve that result

1747698 nu was ik n van de partijraadsleden die betrokken was bij de vergadering over het royement van eerste kamerlid sam pormes het toenmalig partijbestuur royeerde pormes o a vanwege beschuldigingen dat hij betrokkenheid zou hebben bij de molukse kaping bij de punt onderzoek door de partij had in de ogen van het bestuur onvoldoende helderheid gegeven en dat was grond voor royement de partijraad oordeelde anders en dat leidde tot het aftreden van partijvoorzitter herman meijer ik zie nu wel overeenkomsten ontstaan tussen de bekentenis van wijnand duyvendak en de affaire pormes met het grote verschil dat pormes altijd iedere betrokkenheid heeft ontkend en duyvendak nu de inbraak toegeeft hoewel deze is verjaard gold dat voor pormes ook ik vermoed zo maar dat de komende vergadering van de partijraad op 20 september aanstaande erg boeiend zal worden
1747699 wij hebben geen behoefte om afstand te nemen van de woorden van duyvendak
1747700 ik ben eerder veroordeeld voor een inbraak en dit feit is verjaard ik maak me er niet druk om
1747701 wij betreuren het de tweede kamer een ordinaire inbreker als een van haar leden heeft dat duyvendak nu koketteert met waarschijnlijk verjaarde strafbare feiten vinden wij een goedkope en schandelijke pr stunt deze recidiverende inbreker hoort niet in de kamer maar in de gevangenis
1747702 niet alleen wijnand duyvendak maar ook zijn fractie heeft wat uit te leggen hoe denkt groenlinks over de nederlandse wet
1747703 aan de andere kant een groot deel van de nederlanders stemt op iemand die zijn opwachting maakt in rtl boulevard een gebrek aan vertrouwen is dan niet meer van belang

1747708 het boek klimaatactivist in de politiek heb ik geschreven vanuit grote zorg om de klimaatverandering en het gebrek aan politieke actie om daar tegen op te treden in het boek analyseer ik ook welke maatschappelijke beweging er nodig is om tot een afdoende aanpak te komen ik blik daarbij ook terug op mijn eigen actieverleden en leg daarover uitgebreid verantwoording af ik vind dat ook de plicht van een politicus ik heb dat ook al eerder op verschillende manieren gedaan ik trek in het boek uitgebreid lering uit acties waar ik eerder aan heb meegedaan zoals de inbraak bij het ministerie van ez ik beschrijf daarbij waarom ik tot het inzicht ben gekomen dat acties zich moeten richten op de parlementaire besluitvorming en binnen de grenzen van de wet moeten blijven daarmee neem ik afstand van de actiemiddelen van 23 jaar geleden en spreek daarover een negatief oordeel uit ik geef aan waarom ik heb gekozen voor de parlementaire politiek om de klimaatcrisis aan te pakken de keuzes die ik twintig jaar geleden maakte zijn op geen enkele manier meer de keuzes die ik nu zou maken willen we de klimaatcrisis effectief aanpakken dat zijn politici met lef nodig die de noodzakelijke maatregelen nemen en is er een zeer brede en open maatschappelijke beweging onontbeerlijk waar zeer zeer velen zich in herkennen en aan kunnen bijdragen

1747724 the political party that will get my mandate is the one that makes a radical decision to say that all its cabinet ministers having children of schoolgoing age must let them attend public schools

1747740 the trouble is not technology it is not expense it is that world officialdom would much rather track us all around so that if the detail of our movements might be useful to someone in authority one day it will have been secured
1747741 spending x ammount of money on something that is known to fail within the first 6 12 months
1747742 i suppose its more fun to have a victim mentality about it though isnt it
1747743 im just sayin theres enough money being generated that the yearly fee is really just becoming gratuitous for microsoft
1747744 yeah i dont know you shouldnt use that word its just
1747745 no its just well if you dont know why then you just shouldnt even use it
1747746 do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god
1747747 why does god want me to pray in the first place
1747748 and the peace of god which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus
1747749 peace i leave with you my peace i give you i do not give to you as the world gives do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid
1747750 since we have been justified through faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
1747751 that dude superman smacked with a schoolbus that one time

1747753 im not thrilled about killing but sometimes you just have to go there
1747754 another major contributor to the reduction is the increase in sworn staffing over the past few years which has allowed our department to be more proactive with anti crime initiatives
1747755 we definitely have the talent and innovation here and there are excellent opportunities for southern california investors to support entrepreneurs in our own backyard however a clear gap exists when it comes to local support of early stage technology companies
1747756 when you break it down almost 10 percent of the vc funded startups in the united states are based here but we only have three percent of the venture capital the gap is made worse by the fact that southern california vcs tend to be later stage investors
1747757 by any measure southern california is a center of innovation we have some of the countrys top universities spending more than 4 billion a year on research and development and there are more patents issued annually in southern california than in almost any other region of this size the angel network groups have done a good job stepping in at the earliest stages of investment but there are very few groups there to back them up with that first institutional round of funding
1747758 from an investors perspective early stage funds have historically delivered the best returns 35 5 over the past 10 years in my view high net worth individuals family offices and southern california based firms should be looking at early stage investing in this region as a very attractive category
1747759 we are exposed to over 1000 new southern california companies annually and a very small fraction of them will find funding we believe we can do better for both entrepreneurs and potential investors

1747781 luckily between the blogs and the dedicated book review sites such as the short review and rain taxi and newpages where full disclosure im the book review editor there are plenty of places to get your book reviews especially those of independent or small press books also i presume the la times will continue their excellent coverage online both at the main books site and their own excellent blog for proof of how good it is check out their recent coverage of denis johnsons serial novel in playboy their print space may be diminished but i expect their work to continue online which is where most of us read the latbr anyway book reviews are far from dead and online reviews are capable of eventually reaching a larger and larger audience so beyond my sympathy for those who have lost their jobs to these shrinking sections i dont see an overwhelming cause for concern or alarm

1747790 the group has been facing the most challenging economic conditions for decades which has reduced operational performance and has restricted investment in its brands
1747791 these conditions have prevented the group raising the further financing it needed the sale of the business has secured the jobs of 300 of the groups employees
1747792 a reduction in the amount of disposable income as a result of escalating living costs and household bills have played a role in the food and drink groups current difficulties this has been further compounded by a period of wet weather which has failed to boost sales during the summer
1747793 we are constrained by inflation which is temporarily worsening on one side and by deflation which is also worsening on the other not a comfortable position
1747794 i think there is a very good case for raising rates and keeping them at a higher level until inflation turns down again
1747795 i do not see the need for a quarter point hike as a shot across the bows
1747796 wage growth remains muted on all measures and bargaining power should weaken further as demand falls
1747797 a hike would make the mpc look ivory tower and out of touch with the real world
1747798 the next move will be down but it is still some months away
1747799 only when inflation is clearly being tamed can the mpc consider cutting rates
1747800 which shows no sign of easing and may even be getting worse
1747801 until the banks recover their health and their nerve the economy will stay weak that is the main reason why the mpc has no need to raise rates and also why at some point its rate cutting may have to be quick and deep
1747802 although headline inflation remains high with an impending recession it is probable that wages will not respond materially

1747806 i dont see one single positive that tiger woods isnt on our team
1747807 i cant imagine how you can argue a team would be better off without potentially the greatest player who has ever lived certainly the greatest player of his era
1747808 as far as im concerned it really puts europe in an advantageous place it puts europe in a favorite role theres just no question about it
1747809 in the past when you looked at the teams on paper you could maybe say it would be close and it turned out the last two werent close at all but to argue that europe wouldnt be the favorite this time around would be very difficult
1747810 if europe beats us again then its time to say maybe they are beating us because they are just that much better they are great at team play and they seem to have some kind of chemistry that works really really well
1747811 any of those guys im happy with and theres none of those eight guys that know for sure they are going to be on this team
1747812 there is not a single sign of an unmanageable flood of traffic
1747813 i like the way the teams shaped up i couldnt be happier

1747815 my best ryder cup was my first ryder cup i had no experience
1747816 ive said this all along that to me experience is important but it also is overrated i mean experience now anyone who has played ryder cup in the last six ryder cups has experienced getting their ass beat
1747817 i feel like i want players that are playing well and that are hot i feel like were going to probably have seven rookies on this team unless an experienced player gets hot then ill pick him im not going to pick experienced guys simply because they have experience im going to pick players that are playing well and that are very confident
1747818 i dont see one single positive that tiger woods isnt on our team
1747819 i cant imagine how you can argue a team would be better off without arguably the greatest player potentially the greatest player who has ever lived certainly the greatest player of his era
1747820 it puts europe in a i would say without question a favorite role to argue that europe wouldnt be the favorite this time around would be very difficult
1747821 i think that the system thats a one year system produces a guy that plays well that year
1747822 its going to be impossible to make the team based on last years performance alone this year
1747823 i think thats exactly how they should look at it
1747824 i believe the players will be thinking about if they really want to be on this team
1747825 i dont see one single positive that tiger woods isnt on our team
1747826 i cant imagine how you can argue a team would be better off without potentially the greatest player who has ever lived certainly the greatest player of his era

1747836 if john mccain wants to meet me anywhere anytime to have a debate about our respective polices that is a conversation i am happy to have
1747837 if i sound confident and tough right now i can come up with an excuse not to meet mccain later i have no substance i hope my empty rhetoric will get me elected
1747838 so what they are going to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like those other presidents on the dollar bills
1747839 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist
1747840 i hope denying my obviously false and desperate allegation of racism will get me elected
1747841 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some white people to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work

1747957 besides the markets weve already established is to work on radio to get this record on satellite and college and internet radio there are a lot of midwest stations that are not part of clear channel or a big conglomerate if we can get in at a few of those stations it can start to grow
1747958 the major labels may be dead but radio is not
1747959 if a station has a listenership of 40 50 000 and you get even five spins a week who knows how many people may hear your song
1747960 five spins a week may not be much but there are still people that hear your song if they see your flyer and know the name theres a better chance theyll come to the show
1747961 these guys make commercial modern rock look good as much as thats possible though theyve been around for a few years theyre just starting to hit their stride and nows the perfect time to honor them with the up and comers award the skys the limit from here
1747962 we like to have fun and party but we also want to talk about shit that matters
1747963 the last record had songs like pass by and art of growth and rock bottom which all had a positive message to better yourself
1747964 with the next record weve expanded on that it might come off as political at times but thats only one facet of the social consciousness were trying to convey
1747965 brandon has a message and its nice to play with a singer who has a message and believes what hes saying
1747966 is a changing or a turning point an evolution or an emotion by putting my in front of it it just makes it more personal
1747967 one girl i met was a cutter and she told me she felt like one of the songs on the last disc helped her get through some things thats what this is all about its not my solstice its his solstice and her solstice and whoever else the music speaks to

1747971 america needs to listen to shaykh usaamah very carefully and take his message with great seriousness

1747981 if you read the stories of famous entrepreneurs and how they built their organizations you will find that it all comes down to the root of loving what you are doing
1747982 in year two entrepreneurs often find themselves still not making much money and the startup excitement has faded
1747983 the best way to make a lot of money quickly is to find a customer who has a problem and is willing to pay you to solve it and then you go out and build the solution
1747984 a great way to get a business going is to find out what other people have done to achieve success and implement those strategies into your own company
1747985 countless opportunities are generated by connecting with other young entrepreneurs and finding out what they are up to and how you can help
1747986 consumers who are still travelling are clearly hunting for bargains and the bargain hunting is best accomplished on the internet
1747987 there is also a combination of market share gain economy of scale in that were an online operator and our costs increase at a far slower rate than turnover and our effective customer service and marketing
1747988 nevertheless we expect profit growth for 2008 09 to exceed 12 per cent
1747989 the art and science of causing changes in consciousness in accordance with will
1747990 well substantiated scientific explanation of some aspect of the natural world
1747991 public discontent with classical evolution as an inclusive theory stems partly from an intuitive appreciation of its limits
1747992 evolution is just a guess so i dont have to believe it if i dont want to
1747993 falling vehicle prices and the negative equity it is creating continues to pressure sales trends
1747994 unfortunately for carmax we dont see any reason for a quick turnaround in those trends
1747995 while this is clearly a difficult environment for us we remain confident in our superior consumer offer and our long term growth opportunity
1747996 as a basic matter of fairness to all taxpayers the irs cannot allow lilo and silo deals to stand
1747997 i think we need to drop another 30 or 40 cents a gallon before we really see any change in driving habits
1747998 lets face it i didnt lay eyes on them and felt no lack of urgency
1747999 this partnership is the best of both worlds for me and my management team
1748000 we can keep control of our creative challenges and operations while accelerating our growth doing projects all over the world
1748001 were managing the firm to not have to access the government support
1748002 im tired of everyone else harping on 4 a gallon for gas
1748003 weve been paying that for four years when everybody else was paying 2 a gallon
1748004 we are taking care of the challenges we have in alaska on our own
1748005 if we had to go to the store and buy everything wed probably be on food stamps by now if we didnt have our land and sea animals
1748006 more and more our take home pay is going to be spent to buying gas to go get caribou to go get fish to go to our camps and gather our food
1748007 normally i run into six or more boats on the water this time
1748008 where i went on the kobuk i was the only one there im still wondering how many of us will be able to go hunting moose and caribou this year
1748009 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1748010 marks the next step in our strategy to develop a significant platinum business and add further scale and diversification to our portfolio
1748011 xstrata believes that lonmins operations are attractive but that a significant transformation of operating and management practices is required to return lonmin to its former growth trajectory over time
1748012 xstratas offer reflects the operational weakness that lonmin has seen which has made lonmin vulnerable
1748013 the share price fell to a level which i think does significantly understate the value of those assets if they are run properly
1748014 xstrata is easily big enough they can afford to buy lonmin certainly
1748015 the ecb has already warned that second quarter gdp for the whole euro zone may show a contraction

1748026 er pflegte den gesamten scha ban zu fasten er fastete alles au er einwenig von scha ban
1748027 ich habe nie gesehen dass er allahs segen und friede auf ihm einen monat ganz fastete au er den monat ramadan
1748028 ich habe nie den propheten allahs segen und friede auf ihm einen gesamten monat fasten sehen seit der zeit in der er nach medinah kam au er den monat ramadan
1748029 der gesandte allahs allahs segen und friede auf ihm fastete nie einen gesamten monat au er den monat ramadan
1748030 er allahs segen und friede auf ihm vollzog mehr freiwillige fastentage im scha ban als in irgendeinem anderen monat und er fastete die meisten tage von scha ban
1748031 das fasten im scha ban ist besser als das fasten in den heiligen monaten dhul qadah dhul hijjah muharram and rajab soorah tawbah 9 36 und das beste freiwillige fasten ist das was dem monat ramadan am nahesten ist vorher oder nachher
1748032 al sunan al rawaatib freiwillige gebete vor und nach den pflichtgebeten so ist das auch mit dem fasten vor und nach ramadan dieses fasten ist besser als ein fasten in irgendeinem anderen monat
1748033 scha ban ist ein monat dem die menschen keine beachtung schenken zwischen rajab und ramadan
1748034 die anbetung in der zeit der fitna ist wie die hijrah zu mir
1748035 wenn du morgens erwachst und du fastest dann benutze parf m
1748036 es ist empfohlen f r einen mann der fastet parf m zu benutzen damit es kein anzeichen daf r gibt dass er fastet

1748042 emphasized the key role of cheney the unpopular vice president in president bushs energy policy
1748043 this was the largest investment in alternative energy in history
1748044 you know who is in charge now the gestapo agents at the department of homeland security they are in charge
1748045 today is the day when my dream is coming true
1748046 at last i get to finalize the last chapter of my case
1748047 it really feels strange to think that i will see my father for the first time in my life
1748048 i cannot imagine what my father looks like now i will probably be speechless when i see him
1748049 i ask you therefore will you love her honor and keep her and be faithful to her so long as you both shall live
1748050 i bring the adventurous side out of darren he used to be scared of heights
1748051 i am stepping down from the volunteer role i recently agreed to take on with the obama campaign as arab american and muslim american coordinator in order to avoid distracting from barack obamas message of change
1748052 we need muslim americans to get excited about the campaign and theres a lot to get excited about
1748053 and of course there are added sensitivities with our faith given the
1748054 for a man his personality is his destiny if he becomes president his flaws become the nations dangers the voters must judge carefully both the personalities and the ideas of those who would be president
1748055 even so obama should have remained neutral says timuel black a historian and city colleges of chicago professor emeritus who lived in obamas state senate district
1748056 no we did not receive any money back from the obama campaign at any time
1748057 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza
1748058 and while hillary has agreed not to have her name placed in nomination that concession has yet to yield a definitive answer on what exactly her role will be in denver
1748059 if youre under 40 that was a long time ago man
1748060 we just want to celebrate hillarys accomplishments and what shes done for the country as a whole and women in particular
1748061 if the democrats are to have any chance at all of carrying this state it will only be because of a much larger than normal and completely united black vote
1748062 we challenged that because it could have a ripple effect across north carolina
1748063 some of the outside groups that will come in and register voters are not familiar with north carolina law
1748064 they dont have a lot of oversight from the democratic party
1748065 were going to be vigilant through the election cycle that all the rules are followed
1748066 almost every one of those provisions that have been sponsored at the state and national level have been sponsored by republicans and almost uniformly opposed by democrats
1748067 their tactics if theyre not properly punished will be repeated
1748068 the other side is going to throw everything they can to stop him
1748069 many people participated in the may primary and will not be susceptible to the smokescreens
1748070 there are going to be a lot of issues that spring up
1748071 the degree of caffeination of the lawyers involved in this at least on the democratic side is higher than ive ever seen it
1748072 he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills
1748073 indeed when i come to the children of israel and say to them the god of your fathers has sent me to you and they say to me what is his name what shall i say to them
1748074 thus you shall say to the children of israel i am has sent me to you
1748075 job is to think about the national security interest as a whole the generals job is just to get their job done in iraq
1748076 what can i do to save energy as an individual
1748077 at all she says she will vote ron paul i am just thrilled it is one less for the pig the tide is turning
1748078 mr asbahi has informed the campaign that he no longer wishes to serve in his volunteer position and we are in the process of searching for a new national arab american and muslim american outreach coordinator
1748079 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1748080 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1748081 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1748082 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1748083 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1748084 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1748085 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1748086 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1748087 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1748088 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1748089 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation
1748090 i have no idea why john mccain doesnt support it it hurts him in indiana and missouri and ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear
1748091 iowa minnesota wisconsin and perhaps indiana are very important states mccain is behind and hes in danger of falling further behind
1748092 el fin principal de la transfiguraci n era desterrar del alma de los disc pulos el esc ndalo de la cruz

1748106 its become an open secret within the medical community that philip has prostate cancer
1748107 if hed had a serious chest infection that was so worrying it required hospitalization he wouldnt have walked in and out of there smiling and been sitting up in bed replying to letters
1748108 i look at the indictment that was issued as a rather minor indictment because it doesnt indicate he caused any damage to state security
1748109 allows the organization to act without hindrance to recruit and run agents while using supposedly legitimate platforms like foundations and charities
1748110 greyhound knows how important it is to get these removed and we are doing everything possible

1748127 our results provide new insights into the emergence of dairying as a component of the domestication of animals they take the early history of milk use back to the seventh millennium bc early in the evolution of animal domestication and pottery production and use
1748128 processing milk would have had two important advantages providing a means of storing surplus milk as products that is cheese ghee and so on making them available throughout the year and providing a solution for any problems of lactose intolerance most lactose intolerant people have fewer problems with consuming processed milk products
1748129 the regional differences we found are also significant suggesting that early farming was not a fixed package but developed in different ways in different areas probably in response to different environmental conditions and to the different cultural choices of early farmers
1748130 escucho nombres doy besos estrecho manos intercambio palabras en voz baja soy el desconocido al que ellos aceptan como uno de los suyos porque vengo contigo y al formar parte de tu vida tambi n pertenezco a este lugar a la fatigada pesadumbre de quienes llevan muchas noches velando a una enferma a su luto anticipado por ella haber venido aqu contigo me une a ti de una manera nueva no solo a la identidad aislada de la mujer adulta a quien conoc hace no tantos a os sino a todo el tiempo de tu vida y a las caras y a los lugares de tu infancia y tambi n a tus muertos para los que esta casa a la que acabamos de llegar es como un santuario hay una foto grande de tu madre y otra de tus abuelos maternos remotos y solemnes como en un relieve funerario etrusco y sobre el anticuado televisor que probablemente es el mismo en el que ve as de ni a los dibujos animados est la cara sonriente de tu prima en una foto en color me gusta ser aqu unicamente tu sombra quien ha venido contigo mi marido dices present ndome y yo cobro conciencia del valor de esa palabra que es mi salvoconducto en esta casa entre esas personas que te conocieron y te dieron su afecto mucho antes de que yo te encontrara y al ver el modo en que ellas te tratan la familiaridad que establecen enseguida contigo a pesar del tiempo que ha pasado desde la ltima vez que viniste mi amor por ti se ensancha para abarcar esa amplitud de tu experiencia de tus v nculos de ternura y recuerdo conexiones capilares que tambi n me aluden y me nutren a m me agregan ese pasado tuyo que hasta ahora no me pertenec a

1748146 sa di essere al centro degli interessi di mercato di molte societ sportive vi confermo che la roma ha contattato il real per lacquisto del calciatore ma alla dirigenza blanca lofferta della roma apparsa inadeguata
1748147 le cifre sono quelle apparse sulla stampa italiana posso dirle che la cifra offerta dalla roma si aggira intorno ai 12 milioni di euro non posso dirle la cifra offerta al giocatore perch non siamo stati contattati n direttamente n ufficialmente
1748148 no ci sono state altre offerte ma nessuna stata giudicata allaltezza delleffettivo valore del calciatore che ricordo essere un titolare della nazionale brasiliana le ripeto che nessun esponente della societ giallorossa ha parlato direttamente con noi sappiamo dellinteresse ma n io n julio siamo stati interpellati in merito

1748169 a lot of companies seem to feel that tuition assistance programs are a staple of employee benefits one that is likely to influence future productivity engagement and retention
1748170 which is what makes the total lack of measuring the return on these programs such a shock while companies look at layoffs and other cost cutting measures they better focus their attention on measuring the effectiveness of programs where large sums of money are dedicated like tuition reimbursement
1748171 many of the best and brightest like it when their organization or boss pays attention to them and shows a willingness to invest in their skills knowledge and abilities

1748196 allowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction it is the opposite we believe it is a form of harm addition
1748197 i think its pretty embarrassing that he would attend an event that promotes the very things that he criticizes
1748198 he should not have showed up for the endorsement of the who document
1748199 safe injecting sites are not a new intervention but simply a repackaging of existing who recommended interventions such as needle exchanges etc
1748200 they enable known who recommended harm reduction interventions to be delivered and used in a safe environment with the aim of reaching the most marginalized and vulnerable of injecting drug users

1748205 by the time we got to woodstock we were half a million strong
1748206 the music artists and spirit of woodstock resonate as strongly today as in 1969

1748208 woodstock was more than just a concert it was an event it was a time for our generation to speak up and let everyone know we had a voice whether you were there or are discovering the film for the first time it still holds up 40 years later and now will speak to a whole new generation
1748209 50 moments that changed the history of rock n roll

1748215 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1748216 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1748217 for technical reasons these transactions are not currently permitted under law but as a policy matter they should be
1748218 if these transactions make retirees more secure and the pbgc more secure that sounds like a strong positive for the pension insurance system
1748219 theres not a lot of confidence in the capital markets right now

1748221 este es un gran descubrimiento con implicaciones enormes para el futuro y la prosperidad de la humanidad

1748254 the federal government passed a housing recovery act and colorado stands to receive some 250 million of aid which will continue to help us stabilize our housing market
1748255 thats one of the surprising things in the report some counties that were holding their own are now in the 40 percent increase range
1748256 if a person will sit down with a counselor four out of five individuals will be able to avoid foreclosure they can help maneuver the complicated process that most lenders have whether its a restructuring of their existing debt a refinance that works for them or maybe its a forbearance in which they can forgo payments until they get back on their feet
1748257 the effects of a protracted housing downturn declining consumer and business confidence and tight credit have clearly reached the nations commercial real estate markets
1748258 however strong job growth is helping our region weather the national economic downturn
1748259 governments communities and scientists must fully implement combination hiv prevention and the international community must mobilize all the support necessary for this effort
1748260 international institutions national governments and community activists must work together to build demand for hiv prevention
1748261 none of the successes in hiv prevention over the past quarter of a century have been easily won
1748262 many of the victims were not immediately given first aid treatment because of the inaccessibility of the place
1748263 we found out that the victims were afflicted with cholera

1748266 weve had people from around the world from africa from europe from fiji coming up to us and asking us about how we work
1748267 thanks to the unprecedented effort of the global community millions are now receiving life saving aids treatment
1748268 but for every two people we treat in africa this year five more are infected we urgently need innovation and invigoration of hiv prevention in africa
1748269 but even if it doesnt emerge we will advocate things that we believe in
1748270 stronger more visionary and outspoken language must come from the continent most affected by this epidemic
1748271 not everyone might be comfortable with it but we need to talk about hiv about stigma about our behavior because silence and inaction are fatal
1748272 politicians dont include indigenous people in their anti aids campaigns its as if were asexual or dont exist
1748273 they never talk to us about hiv or about sexually transmitted diseases
1748274 having hiv aids campaigns for indigenous peoples would be recognition of the historical debt towards native peoples
1748275 from a very young age we were sent out of our homes most of us dont have identity papers and that blocks us from many things
1748276 we know that the police dont respect this document that they throw it in the trash or trample on it but it has helped us to get closer to colombias hospitals
1748277 some are really sick and they go to the doctor but when their male name is called out in a hospital waiting room and everyone sees them as a woman they quickly take the antiretroviral medicine and leave

1748279 the problem is that politicians use religious ideas to manipulate people

1748341 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
1748342 not because of my own nostalgic feelings for the program but because i feel it is still such a special nurturing voice in the lives of children

1748344 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1748345 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1748346 in the past few years many women who are well educated and trained for career tracks have decided instead to stay at home
1748347 it says we make enough money that we both dont need to work outside the home
1748348 and especially with the recent economic pressures a stay at home spouse is often an extreme and visible luxury
1748349 if you told me years ago that i was going to be a stay at home wife i would have laughed at you
1748350 i was able to clip coupons do all the chores and make nice dinners
1748351 when catherine stays at home i feel the house is more together because she has the time to do things like in depth cleaning and can be more attentive to the garden
1748352 she also has more time to find good deals at secondhand stores garage sales and at grocery stores
1748353 over the past six months we have been keenly aware that in light of the unstable economic climate we have been assigning past due accounts to vwa far more frequently with aging receivables dated 90 days past due as opposed to the usual 120 days we have been working in partnership with vwa for three years and they are an excellent third party collection outsource provider for us on the average we receive approximately an 80 return on the receivables assigned to vwa
1748354 2checkout com has been working with vwa for eight months and to date weve seen substantial recoveries of our bad debt receivables
1748355 we go through a process internally trying to retrieve funds from clients with a negative balance the process involves email phone and mail contact in an effort to recoup the funds owed if we cant collect them in 180 days the receivables are sent to vwa in the past year we have had a significant increase in aging receivables prompting us to work with vwa to recoup funds and improve our liquidity
1748356 when a comparison is made of the second quarter 2008 to the same quarter in 2007 dollars placed for collection with ccaa members rose substantially by approximately 24 on a year by year comparison twelve months ending june 2008 vs twelve months ending june 2007 the dollars placed for collection rose by approximately 22 and the number of accounts placed rose by about 10 if the trend continues 2008 could be a record year for account placement
1748357 in a contracting economy receivables become a prime concern for many companies as they stumble on roadblocks when it comes to reconciling their outstanding accounts and when that happens keeping a close eye on cash takes center stage working capital is squeezed at both ends as the business looks to negotiate better terms with suppliers and at the same time guard against inevitable customer defaults
1748358 tough economies always result in increased bad debt or the need to cure slow paying customers
1748359 based upon close interaction with clients and the marketplace the increased activity is in line with our expectations we anticipate these levels to continue for both commercial and consumer debt through 2008 the majorities of our clients have begun to tighten their extension of credit and are looking to liquidate their own receivables earlier in the collection cycle to mitigate any potential risk of additional write offs
1748360 livevox has become a crucial component of our collection strategy
1748361 with no capital expenditures we can manage the increased volumes that come with a tough economy and maximize agent productivity with the virtually unlimited capacity of the livevox system we are no longer constrained by the limits of traditional dialers and our collectors love it because they are always on the phone
1748362 livevox is working with the credit and collections industry to transform the way it views dialer technology
1748363 during a tough economy collection organizations benefit from larger volumes but liquidation rates decline our hosted voip dialer enables companies to achieve their business goals without the limitations and expense of traditional hardware or hosted systems
1748364 we expect credit card receivables to grow in the high single digits for the year 2008
1748365 as credit card use increases issuers take actions to manage risk
1748366 we will continue to monitor revolving debt growth to see the impact on collateral performance in addition to the incentives present for banks to manage portfolio credit risk credit card abs transactions have structural features that allow issuers to add higher quality receivables
1748367 cti has partnered with css impact collection solution software inc located in woodland hills california as our collection software vendor of choice
1748368 we are pleased to form this alliance with cti and look forward to broadening our global reach because of our ease of use and international foreign currency capabilities we are a perfect fit for ctis world wide vision
1748369 we are delighted to have a person of mr mays caliber and stature exclusively assisting us in our turnaround efforts specifically his understanding of the credit card work product proficiency in devising workflow strategies and implementation of staff motivational techniques will prove to be extremely beneficial and invaluable as umc accelerates its entry into and fosters new relationships in these markets

1748398 coming off a two year period of exceptionally strong performance following the bankruptcy act of october 2005 card portfolios have some cushion before breaching historical performance levels
1748399 however economic pressure increased borrower debt reload rates and lack of alternative debt refinancing options are steadily chipping away at that cushion

1748415 il finale di arancia meccanica diverso da quello del libro
1748416 esistono due versioni del romanzo ma io ho letto quella che contiene un capitolo in pi solo dopo aver lavorato per molti mesi alla sceneggiatura sono rimasto sorpreso perch non cera alcun rapporto con lo stile satirico del resto del libro credo che leditore sia riuscito a convincere burgess a chiudere con una nota di speranza o qualcosa di simile sinceramente quando ho letto lultimo capitolo non potevo credere ai miei occhi alex esce di prigione e torna a casa uno dei ragazzi si sposa laltro sparisce e alla fine alex decide di diventare un adulto responsabile

1748422 theres a focus on attitude with each song we asked ourselves does this song have the attitude and aggression that we want this album to have
1748423 davids very guttural and powerful we wanted to get back to do what he did on the first record aggressive raps and fast vocals that hes so good at and hes still got the wide open choruses
1748424 david writes about a lot of things in his life as well as the state of the world he has a lot of relationship issues to get through hes the kind of guy who things can go right for him and it can go wrong for him at the same time theres a little black cloud over him he had his garage burned up he laid down his motorcycle in the year we were putting this album together i think he had plenty of inspiration to write he really put a lot of his personal issues into the material its probably vey hard but its the best way to write
1748425 theyre a powerful act p o d have some great songs some powerful hits its not just us being there and like whoever being the opening act the acts add value to the ticket its a full evening of music for everybody
1748426 it gives me great pleasure to see chrono trigger being released in europe and the pal territories

1748443 superficiellement le mythe l uvre est que chaque film a deux versions une bonne et une mauvaise en r alit il sous entend que chaque film a au moins deux versions une bonne et une meilleure
1748444 a failure but an endlessly fascinating one between making his only sf film
1748445 the come dressed as the sick soul of europe parties
1748446 at one stage we had the idea of making as many versions of v ronique as there are cinemas in which the film was to be shown in for example the film was to be shown in seventeen cinemas so we had the idea to make seventeen different versions it would be quite expensive of course especially at the last stage of production making internegatives individual re recordings and so on but we had very precise ideas for all these versions whats a film we thought theoretically its something which goes through a projector at the speed of twenty four frames a second and in fact the success of cinematography depends on repetition that is whether you project in a huge cinema in or in a tiny cinema in m awa or a medium sized cinema in the same thing appears on screen because the film passes through the projector at the same speed and so we thought why in fact does it have to be like that why cant we say that the film is hand made and that every versions going to be different and that if you see version number 00241b then itll be a bit different from 00243c maybe itll have a slightly different ending or maybe one scene will be a tiny bit longer and another a bit shorter or maybe therell be a scene which isnt in the other version and so on thats how we worked it out and thats how the script was written we shot enough material to make these versions possible it would be possible to release this film with the concept that it was so to speak hand made that if you go to a different cinema youll see the same film but in a slightly different version and if you go to yet another cinema youll see yet another version seemingly the same film but a little different maybe itll have a happier ending or maybe slightly the chance you take anyway the possibility was there but as always of course it turned out that production absolutely didnt have the time and that in fact there wasnt any money for it either perhaps the money was less important the main problem was time there wasnt any time left
1748447 of course i thought about the audience all the time while making v ronique so that i even made a different ending for the americans because i thought you have to meet them halfway even if it means renouncing your own point of view
1748448 because if orson were alive today im sure he would have done it himself
1748449 my effort has been to keep scrupulous care that this memo should avoid those wide and sweeping denunciations of your new material to which my own position naturally and sorely tempts me in this one instance im passing on to you a reaction based not on my convictions as to what my picture ought to be but only what here strikes me as significantly mistaken in your picture its sufficiently your own by now for me to be able to judge it on what i take to be your terms alone and to bring to that judgment after so much time away from the film in any form a certain freshness of eye
1748450 i ask you please to believe that what minimum criticism of that new material i am passing on to you is made in recognition and full acceptance of the fact that the final shape and emphasis of the film is to be wholly yours i want the picture to be as effective as possible and now of course that means effective in your terms
1748451 the directors cut the original cut of the futuristic adventure
1748452 i had to resign myself to coming up with a directors cut that was only a slightly modified version of the original theatrical release but it was better than nothing

1748494 what we have produced is new in terms of using fruit flavours and giving them a top note fibre is out there but fruit fibre isnt being used in this way
1748495 with the health benefits associated with them and the fact when the fibarome is in application it is fruit depictable and natural we feel this reflects the cost and be attractive to customers looking for clean labelling on their products
1748496 however as the appeal of fruit fibres grows i am sure more will become available

1748500 now im finding this extreme sense of urgency to cut to the core to get to the truth it strikes me that theres a real lack of protest songwriters out there what a real opportunity this is to write about what all of us are feeling collectively to serve the role artists have served historically
1748501 a wholly inspired creative environment for me a very prolific time
1748502 not to sound too harsh but with this record im not concerned who im going to lose or pick up
1748503 because everything felt more urgent the environment a war based on deception and in general across the board people in america have become comatose or dulled out by the immense amount of information thats out there i had to take a leap of faith that a lot of people are feeling the way im feeling
1748504 its either very sad or very telling but music has become commerce artists havent really stepped up and written as artists

1748514 as a political consultant and a newspaper publisher im familiar with spin but theres not really much way to spin this a few days ago tests revealed i have a cancerous brain tumor
1748515 we will wait for tomorrow and will abide by what the decision will be
1748516 we are simply trying to protect our interests that is all
1748517 we the p5 1 are very disappointed that iran has failed yet again to give us a clear answer to the p5 1 generous package
1748518 given the absence of a clear positive response from iran and its failure to meet the deadline set by the unscr 1803 the p5 1 are discussing the next steps in the unsc and beginning to consider the possible outlines of another sanction resolution
1748519 we certainly do not believe that it is a foregone conclusion that it the dialogue is not going to be successful
1748520 we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive given that we dont have a decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1748521 important not to break the chain of the negotiations or we will face a difficult dynamic not only with iran
1748522 we cant deny to the other party the right to pose questions if there are problems
1748523 the message at the end of the telephone conference will probably be an agreement for an explanatory mission and at the same time a firm message with the threat of new sanctions
1748524 while informal contact between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and irans chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili will continue we have no choice but to pursue further
1748525 the p5 1 major powers are discussing next steps in the and beginning to consider possible outlines of another sanctions resolution
1748526 we are very disappointed that iran has failed yet again to give a clear answer to the p5 1 generous incentives package the letter we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
1748527 iran has a clear choice engagement or isolation we regret that irans leaders appear to have chosen isolation if iran continues to refuse to come to the negotiating table the international pressure on iran will only grow
1748528 we regret that iran has once again chosen not to answer clearly despite all the efforts the six have made these past weeks to offer a framework for negotiations
1748529 we havent set any deadlines ourselves for their response and there is ongoing dialogue
1748530 certainly there is a matter which is going to be discussed by the ministers in september
1748531 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1748532 the more things change the more they stay the same
1748533 it highlights and accentuates the need to go back to a value proposition that consumers care about
1748534 what comes to mind when you think of performance and brand building
1748535 we are definitely behind which is why we were on an evangelization mission
1748536 obama is a politician trying to win an election not a professor of ethics
1748537 hillary clinton who sadly lost to obama despite her pledge to obliterate iran if they attacked israel the little gem
1748538 i dont think im being unfair at all if obama was called a jew or a buddhist i strongly doubt hed make a fuss about it even if he didnt appreciate being mistakenly called either
1748539 he seems to be positively going out of his way to assure everyone that not only has he never been muslim he sure as hell wouldnt want to be one
1748540 simple denial was all it takes thats what he would have done you might not like it but muslims are viewed with deep suspicion by much probably most of the us electorate

1748555 i do not see us facing a recession even if hte united states itself goes into a recession i dont see us doing that

1748898 israel displayed an excellent ear and fine false turn of phrase during the 15 or so months in the early 1990s when she sold hundreds of phony celebrity letters and a lot of filched real ones to about 30 different dealers now all these years later shes written a slender sordid and pretty damned fabulous book about her misadventures if i were a librarian i wouldnt let lee israel through the door but id certainly make sure i had her latest book on the shelves if i were an editor id sign her up to write a biography of louise brooks and not just to keep her out of trouble
1748899 the effect of this book on me was to make me like ammon shea and briefly to hate english what a choking god awful mash it is surely french is better then i recovered and saw its greatness afresh the o e d shea notes is a catalog of the foibles of the human condition shea has walked the wildwood of our gnarled ancient speech and returned singing incomprehensible sounds in a language that turns out to be our own
1748900 doris lessing once declared that fiction makes a better job of the truth than straightforward reminiscence and while that might well be true of her celebrated and semi autobiographical martha quest novels its an observation that doesnt apply at all to her latest book alfred amp emily an intriguing work that is half fiction half memoir the sketchy insubstantial first half of the book imagines what her parents lives might have been like if world war i had never occurred the potent and harrowing second half recounts the real life story of her parents and the incalculable ways in which the war fractured their dreams and psyches and left them stranded in the bush in africa eking out a meager existence on a tiny farm in rhodesia

1748903 this sly and discombobulating flight of whimsy by david deans is in a sense a book length joke and nothing drains the humor from a good joke as effectively as vivisecting it has comenius hallucinated his transformation and if so where did he acquire his knowledge of kafka and rilke of orpheus and lady macbeth is bob a good guy after all is he even out of town let alone in mexico and where is miss scarlett anyway mr deans may or may not provide the answers to these queries but the readers irresistible desire to know is evidence that hes pulled off a splendid joke
1748904 despite its specific american flavors travel writing seems most like a contemporary french novel such as those by christian oster and gregoire bouillier a book in which an atmosphere of established and almost enviable dailiness underwrites sophisticated narrative conceits truth matters less than the telling and that makes for a cool easy kind of fiction its not hemingway or borges or even dashiell hammett but its nice
1748905 have i raved enough i feel as if im barrys publicist or agent maybe shell give me a cut of the 2 million but i did love this book it didnt matter if i was in a bad mood or tired or had other things to do i wanted to read this book i wanted to be living in these characters minds hanging out in salem or on yellow dog island does the novel deserve the hype i certainly dont begrudge it
1748906 the now forgotten us immigrants to the soviet union in the early thirties were communist sympathisers or more often desperate victims of the depression at first they were feted waves of repression however ensured that they and their descendants ended up either in russias prisons or as inmates of the gulag this is a powerful important and highly readable book the gulag is no novelty but tzouliadis brilliantly links high politics to the torment of innocents adding devastating detail

1748910 la roma ha contattato il real madrid le cifre sono quelle apparse sulla stampa italiana posso dirle che la cifra offerta dalla roma si aggira intorno ai 12 milioni di euro ma la dirigenza spagnola ha ritenuto lofferta giallorossa non adeguata non posso dirle la cifra offerta al giocatore perch non siamo stati contattati n direttamente n ufficialmente

1748915 the closer you got the terminus the stronger the support was i think the petition puts to an end once and for all to the idea that medford is somehow divided on the green line it is not the green line supporters have presented overwhelming numbers in favor of the green line and the few opponents of the green line have not this is not to diminish in any way the abutters concerns which mgna has always said need to be addressed in a fair and transparent manner but the impression that medford is divided over the green line is false and our numbers prove it

1749095 there was a real dearth of expertise as voip technology was being deployed in 2003 so it was about getting that technology via service providers to customers in ways that were cost effective and worked well
1749096 its the idea of building adapters into the various systems and then allowing those adapters to have customized business logic defined by each service provider as they go to market
1749097 managed services is really the evolution of the systems integrator
1749098 a systems integrator would come in integrate systems and provide some kind of low level ongoing support we come in and its really an ongoing relationship were establishing with you but we start with integration
1749099 we get involved in the engineering part as well deploying the best of breed systems not just installing an oss around them or integrating them with an oss
1749100 we do everything from ordering sourcing rack and stack bringing it up into service training testing and ongoing support
1749101 traditionally you had two choices as you went to market as a service provider
1749102 you could go as a facilities based provider with huge capex up front and very substantial opex to run all the facilities and systems or you could go out as a reseller and a reseller lacks the real control of your destiny
1749103 then theres what we call on demand pricing per seat used so you could have a sylantro seat an auto attendant seat a unified messaging seat but generally at the lowest level its about 5 to 8 a month
1749104 having a large noc having a lot of resources and having 24 7 support coverage are really important when you have software as a service or any kind of managed application
1749105 we really have hands on 24 7 support were doing something like 40 tickets a day
1749106 a lot of our competitors offering voip managed services are pretty much at the mercy of if its broadsoft whatever the broadsoft system can do or if its sylantro whatever the sylantro system can do
1749107 not so with voip really what cortex can do can you integrate it with our web site sure can you present billing and messaging and the phone service in one window of course can resellers and agents sell our product sure under their logo sure so its really about giving them flexibility

1749148 since the collapse of the soviet empire many defenders of socialism have argued that dictators including mao stalin and pol pot were aberrations they took marxs ideas in the wrong direction they claim that nationalization of the means of production call it communism socialism or marxism and democracy can be compatible in the road to serfdom hayek showed that it cannot some 50 years later hayeks argument holds every socialist regime tends toward authoritarianism of some sort chavez reminds us of the anti democratic nature of socialism as such he is turning into a major embarrassment for many on the left who supported him unfortunately what the proponents of socialism again and again fail to realize is that it is the message not the messenger that is embarrassing

1749167 on january 12 2008 ultimatebet was alerted to allegations that a player with the online handle
1749168 we immediately launched an extensive inquiry involving an independent third party expert to review hundreds of thousands of hand histories all of which were promptly locked down and made available to this expert
1749169 ultimatebet is in regular communications and contact with its regulatory authority the kahnawake gaming commission kgc and will continue to cooperate fully with that body

1749171 its sort of a non stop thing these assets are very attractive to all sorts of parties whether theyre strategic financial or sovereign funds
1749172 ive got no idea really those ones in particular use the merchant banks to facilitate introductions
1749173 the banks say they have a mandate and you dont know exactly who it is
1749174 there is certainly interest from financial buyers fund interest and port operators interest
1749175 the board will keep an open mind of course for an offer of the whole company that reflects fair value
1749176 however our primary focus remains on delivering value to our shareholders through the execution of our plans and strategy
1749177 to gain a recommendation from the board and the right to conduct due diligence any proposal must recognise the value of our unique set of assets and must contain a sufficient control premium and this proposal did not reach the mark

1749184 we were pleased with the strong and balanced growth achieved by our global operations in the past quarter particularly the accelerated growth experienced in the us market
1749185 our industry received positive signals that it is poised for continued growth

1749187 we are particularly pleased to have been able to maintain our dividend
1749188 in the first half our steel business found it tough but we have done really well with our electronics business
1749189 its one of those results where if we didnt have the diversity we would have been exposed to a downturn
1749190 the results in the second half showed some improvement over the first half
1749191 kick a poker keeps its fingers on the pulse of the current state of the online poker world
1749192 online poker players are a massive target for hackers people play it with real money obviously so theyre a big target we were just investigating a case where a professional online poker player was attacked by someone he would play against regularly online and were talking about professional players and big money hundreds of thousands of euros on the table at a time
1749193 this went on for weeks and when we looked into it we realised that one of the other players at the table had sent him a tool a calculater to help optimise the poker playing or whatever and we found that the application included a trojan
1749194 which means that when he was playing online poker against these people who were in another country the guy could press a button and he would receive a screenshot of the targets screen
1749195 its a clever attack because the hacker could have just stolen the account and moved the money away but he would have been caught but this way the target was losing his money to someone else and he didnt realise it was a con i dont think many online poker players realise that those kind of attacks are being done
1749196 tariq al daour was sentenced last summer in london with two of his friends for using windows trojans
1749197 they set up new accounts with the stolen cards and of course they played against themselves losing on purpose this way they were able to launder the money again its pretty clever because if someone comes asking about all their money they can prove they won it at poker
1749198 they laundered close to about two million euros and the really weird part is what they did with the money they took the money back to online shops and bought really weird stuff like hiking boots tents knives gps devices radios
1749199 and then they would use couriers to ship those goods to iraq to help the insurgents there fight against british and american troops so what we have here is a link between online crime windows trojans etc and the funding of insurgents in iraq its quite an unusual case
1749200 mikko hypp nen the chief research officer at security software company f secure
1749201 all told al daour and other members of the group conducted 350 transactions at 43 different online wagering sites using more than 130 compromised credit card accounts it didnt matter if they lost money on their wagering winnings were withdrawn and transferred to online bank accounts the men controlled

1749432 critics will point out that the wind seems to stop blowing when you want electricity most on hot summer days and that is a problem however a study last year by stanford university shows that wind power from interconnected farms can be used as reliable base load electric power
1749433 as one might expect not all locations make sense for wind farms but legendary oilman t boone pickens says the united states should take advantage of the so called wind corridor stretching from the canadian border to west texas
1749434 energy from wind turbines built there could supply 20 or more of the nations power by 2030 according to a new report from the department of energy
1749435 u s electrical demand is expected to grow another 39 through 2030 so wind would help fill the gap and although wind is expensive costs per unit should come down with a larger scale operation besides with the cost of coal and natural gas rising wind is already becoming more competitive
1749436 unlike wind we tend to get the most solar power when most electricity is needed during hot summer months and the technology is working now there are two general forms of solar power
1749437 the first is pv or photovoltaic which converts energy from photons directly into electricity the second is thermal which uses the suns heat concentrated to heat liquids to transfer that heat boil water and turn a turbine
1749438 a rooftop photovoltaic system is fairly expensive about 35 000 to 40 000 though the cost can be reduced through tax incentives and rebates
1749439 solar thermal is also expensive though cheaper than pv based solar power the mojave desert in the southwest is home to the largest solar thermal system in the united states
1749440 this solar energy generation system has a total capacity of 354 megawatts and new technology allows for better cheaper storage of solar energy even when the sun isnt shining of course wind and solar arent widely used to power cars but that too can change
1749441 still i want you to know that there are workable solutions right now and not only can they help our country but they can reward investors too there are a bunch of great funds in the alternative energy space
1749442 here are two etfs one that focuses on wind the other on solar the tan holds a basket of 25 stocks in the solar space and it is a fund with a global portfolio as its name implies pwnd is a basket of 32 companies also worldwide that are focusing on wind energy
1749443 the risk of waiting for the right time to invest appears to be much greater than the potential rewards
1749444 we have great growing business there but just this is purely me im sorry im the more i read about investments in russia the less i like the feel of it the more successful wed be the more vulnerable wed be to have it stolen from us so there we sell now

1749457 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

1749462 embraces diversity in its entries and it is important to us that we remain open to the many styles through which artists engage with the subject area
1749463 the fact that he admitted he doesnt like my work shows that hes being subjective and close minded and not academic at all

1749466 when you look across the medal opportunities its been driven by the track but on the road we have nicole cooke shanaze reade who is the reigning world champion and in mountain biking we have liam killeen who was fourth in the worlds
1749467 we have a realistic chance for medals in 11 out of the 18 events its absolutely the best british team thats ever left british shores
1749468 everyone thinks were just going to show up and win it its going to be a close call
1749469 the danes have stepped up theyve been training at altitude theyve gone
1749470 we know across the board where we are at and we know more or less where the opposition is we know what sort of times we are looking to ride

1749477 mr bush wrote a two paragraph memorandum to the department of justice saying texas courts must obey the icj ruling and review mr medell ns conviction and sentence to determine whether his rights were violated because he was not allowed to contact his consulate
1749478 the u s supreme court rejected the administrations arguments ruling 6 3 that under the constitution the president did not have the unilateral authority to compel state officials to comply with an international treaty
1749479 human rights watch and amnesty international contend that executing foreign citizens in opposition to the court order could put u s citizens abroad at risk of being convicted and even executed for crimes without having access to u s consulates or embassies

1749481 anyone have a rough estimate of how many gannett papers have offered buyouts now
1749482 im in montgomery and we havent heard any talk of it but the recent rash of buyouts has many people nervous
1749483 every newspaper will face this in the very near future a reader here says
1749484 the loser papers those with publishers with the 60s mentality of 30 40 profit margins frozen in their brains are the first to be affected cincy is a classic example they have had 900 employees its a wonder they arent looking for 250 buyouts
1749485 we are thankful to the lookouts for helping us with our season ticket distribution
1749486 we think this will be a fun way for our season ticket holders to get their tickets and take in a lookouts game at the same time

1749505 the federal drug enforcement administration office in new york has confirmed that they have issued a subpoena that would force mary kate olsen to testify in front of a grand jury
1749506 though olsens attorney has rejected multiple requests from federal officials to talk to the actress she could face a grand jury subpoena to testify according to the post
1749507 unlike inquiry into ledgers death by the new york police department which was completed with olsens cooperation federal investigators are seeking information from the actress about where he got his drugs and medicines
1749508 it may not mean anything other than shes getting good legal advice
1749509 you dont know what the dea may suspect in this case and i think its a cautious way to proceed i think it would be wrong to assume shes done something criminal simply because shes invoking her fifth amendment against self incrimination

1749514 estoy muy contento porque entre las opciones que ten a de salir del levante la del betis era la m s interesante y el esfuerzo que han hecho para ficharme es para estar contento

1749526 large gender differences in the propensity to choose challenging tasks appear to be driven by gender differences in risk aversion and in confidence about the ability to perform a new and potentially difficult task
1749527 however the authors examine an environment in which women and men perform equally well and in which issues of discrimination or time spent on the job do not have any explanatory power

1749576 its a non bailable offence but it is normally granted except in the case of anwar

1749600 i wish to remind all quarters including supporters of anwar to abide by the countrys laws do not give vent to your emotions and let the police do their duty
1749601 police had carried out an investigation on a sexual crime involving intercourse against the order of nature involving anwar based on existing legal principles and procedures
1749602 the investigation papers had been handed over to the office for advice and a decision
1749603 pkr youth believes this action is reprehensible and cruel to prevent anwar from campaigning actively and contesting in the by election and we do not rule out political interference to prevent t anwar from getting to putrajaya
1749604 i hold the prime minister personally responsible for the damage that is about to be done to the nation and to the integrity and dignity of the malays
1749605 i have thus far constrained my criticism of the prime minister to his failed policies and general incompetence in leading the nation
1749606 but now it is clear that his vendetta against those who would seek his early dismissal from office knows no boundaries and will transgress all limits of the rule of law
1749607 this is a man under siege he sees no way out but to deflect the attention of the malaysian people with a sham trial against me he is now burning the forest to save his own tree
1749608 the real criminals will in their efforts to humiliate me and to derail the peoples aspirations for transformational change in malaysia hide behind a smokescreen created by the government controlled mainstream media
1749609 the evidence proves that the accuser lied in his initial report
1749610 other witnesses in this case have been threatened and harassed in order to fabricate evidence doctors appear to have been pressure to violate all norms of medical ethics
1749611 senior ministers in their comments about the case have demonstrated their consistent interference in the investigation

1749614 until today ive not seen the police report dated june 28 by accuser saiful and the medical report where is sanity and rule of law
1749615 if anwar is denied bail the very morality and legitimacy of the abdullah premiership will come under question nationally and internationally which will be a very sad end for a prime minister who had started his administration with such high hopes and great mandate from ordinary malaysians less than five years ago
1749616 are we a nation which deserves international trust and respect for our high and unquestioned regard for the rule of law and a judiciary of independence impartiality integrity and meritocracy
1749617 he dr koh just decided a short while ago to have the debate he is very excited to face up with guan eng who is also dap secretary general
1749618 guan eng has been holding the media limelight too long and has been misleading the people now its gerakans chance to counter the daps propaganda
1749619 we will let the public decide whether guan eng is just an empty vessel making a lot of noise
1749620 what the people want to know is about the land scam if you want to debate on other issues it will defeat the purpose
1749621 this is to ensure that nobody will abuse their position and government machinery during the umno elections it is up to the aca whether to take any action
1749622 it is not only umno members who want a fair election but also malaysians and especially the malay community want the same thing
1749623 i can only say that my report is against the powers that be who are the most powerful people in this country
1749624 if i were to run in kulim bandar baharu they would say i wanted my wife and daughter with me in parliament
1749625 now that i am running in permatang pauh they say wan azizah has cheated and wronged the people why dont they let the voters decide what is right or wrong
1749626 they asked me go to the hospital why im not sick but if i dont go they say i am not cooperating they asked me to strip if i refuse i am wrong they asked me to fill in a rape victims form as well
1749627 finally when i refused to have a picture of me taken naked they say anwar is not cooperative
1749628 why did they have to bring such a big team just one corporal wouldve sufficed
1749629 im not surprised but if they want to do it bring it down to rm2

1749631 we admit that money politics exists in the division but we have yet to take any action we will bring up the case to the umno secretariat for further action
1749632 all these are like cancer which could destroy umno we are fighting each other by using not only money politics but also outside influence and threats
1749633 hurling abuses and inviting outsiders to hurl abuses also are not right never have i seen things like these before
1749634 to pretend we can ever get hold of this without dealing with that the idea of unprotected sexual relations with unlimited numbers of partners i think would be naive
1749635 you can get the universal treatment the moneys there now if we spend it most effectively but we dont have the health care systems to reach out to people get them tested and diagnosed in a timely fashion get them on treatment and do the regular followups

1749642 it got to the point where no one wanted to wrestle him
1749643 i think we left that conversation with him saying no
1749644 he has a tremendous passion for wrestling he has a dedication you dont see in people that age and hes very coachable always eager to learn
1749645 my parents wanted me to be well rounded and they were afraid id get burned out if i did it year round but i didnt want to do anything else
1749646 hes the complete package he has intensity and smarts and he is such an analyst there were times in our wrestling room when we just shut down and watched him
1749647 i asked him do you believe jake has what it takes
1749648 and brandon said if hell listen to me hell never lose another match in the state tournament
1749649 when jake does something he does it with all his heart
1749650 he is so focused so disciplined nothing he does surprises me
1749651 there has never been a time when he said he was going to do something and he didnt do it
1749652 i looked at my wife and said get the credit card
1749653 hes still a kid his body is still maturing but hes grown up in the past three weeks and learned to compete with men
1749654 all our veterans love him i love him if he wrestles like he did at the trials he could surprise a lot of guys
1749655 some people asked why would you let her do this i could never tell her no and about six matches into her career word got out that she wasnt going to back down
1749656 i was flying back from a usa wrestling trip to new york right after the olympic trials when it hit me
1749657 only eight american women have ever had the opportunity to wrestle in the olympics it took a lot of hard work and there might be people who dont think girls should be doing this but ive gotten so much from this sport its definitely worth the fight
1749658 a lot of times in a smaller town something like this would not fly
1749659 but her mindset and the way she handles herself off the mat makes it easy to respect her
1749660 she never tried to prove a point she wrestled just because she enjoyed it she was just being ali
1749661 from the time my girls were in the womb i told them they could do anything they wanted
1749662 there was one match when i told ali that scoring one point could be her goal she looked at me like i was crazy she wanted to win
1749663 i knew it would be tough but when she heard negative comments they just fueled her thats the kind of person she is
1749664 pin her and pull her around the mat by her hair
1749665 i dont think youd like her to do that to your son
1749666 i think what got her through the guy girl part of this was that she is extremely mentally tough
1749667 she sets a great example for all kids with her work ethic and her passion for the sport
1749668 she never expected to be treated any differently from the guys to us she was just always part of the team
1749669 since january all weve done is train train train we might get out for a walk or a movie but shes dedicated herself to putting in the work
1749670 i knew in my heart she was going to make it when she did i had to go outside and take a few deep breaths it is an awesome thing

1749674 a small island in the often shrill sea of criticism of obama
1749675 mccain gained 20 and obama lost 16 among voters ages 18 29 obama still leads that group 49 38
1749676 obama is the talented salesman who seduced one state after another saying iowa this is our moment virginia this is our moment texas this is our moment and then tells europe people of berlin people of the world this is our moment how many times can barack obama sell the same moment to everyone before he becomes mel brooks in the producers
1749677 my stories are about modern life about city life what we learn from bulgarian literature classes at school is barely informative classic literature does not touch what we feel nowadays
1749678 i admired him for his internal honesty and his willingness to stand up very intensively for his own views
1749679 of course nothing is eternal but i hope every generation will have a person such as him
1749680 you get the impression that the younger generations know nothing about him
1749681 i may have read something by solzhenitsyn in school but i dont remember
1749682 i dont know him so why should i go and pay last respects to him
1749683 if you are either obama or mccain you want to get over the 50 percent line with women
1749684 although women credited hillary with clearing the path for future aspirants theyre much less certain it will be her or when that will be
1749685 many of these women intuit that whoever wins this election will be a one termer but it may also be a function of the feeling that hope springs eternal
1749686 we know the sanitary district has the infrastructure in place to be able to support the development
1749687 it is infrastructure well have to buy our way into
1749688 pretends he is an american citizen saying that he was born in vermont but was when a child taken back with his parents to ireland where he was educated
1749689 deliberately procuring an assembly of people with the determination of subverting the government of the united states
1749690 a willful disregard for the health and safety of those using the facilities
1749691 the three universities have identified the repairs that are critical for the health and safety of the students faculty and employees
1749692 i have read that asu plans to use its funds to address all of its identified fire life safety issues shockingly the u of a and nau plan to address only some of their critically needed repairs
1749693 there will be no students threatened in any way because of a lack at any of the three universities taking care of their deferred maintenance
1749694 i find it audacious for the speaker to raise concerns about the priorities of this spending when he voted against the entire package and opposed anything going to these three funds including health and safety
1749695 that means ua isnt fixing 17 million of life safety issues
1749696 the speaker is saying we just gave you a billion dollars
1749697 life threatening but we dont want it to get to that point
1749698 these are issues the legislature has been aware of for years and has refused to fund
1749699 examined all deferred maintenance needs and education needs and there will be no fire and life safety issues that wont be addressed
1749700 although there is a lot of commotion about europe right now in our seven years we have produced 5 times more nba players than any other professional basketball league in the world including any of the top european leagues
1749701 i can sit here and spill out all kinds of stuff injuries or what have you brown said for the reasons his career has stalled
1749702 an interesting tidbit about the heats waiver claim of swingman bobby jones because jones doesnt begin to collect salary until the start of the season and because his guarantee date is not until aug 15 jones essentially is currently a member of the heat at absolutely no cost he however cannot be immediately dealt because of the nbas 30 day rule after waiver claims
1749703 with the opening ceremony of the games only two days away there still needs to be some sorting out at the point position team usa is still playing three point guards all of whom are used to having the ball in their hands and running an offense at the nba level i dont think that can last it will be interesting to see who gets the bulk of the minutes at that position the ability to defend quick penetrating point guards will be a key patrick mills got in lane yesterday and carlos arroyo hurt team usa on penetrations in the past

1749729 he was convicted of five counts of providing material support for terrorism specifically that his personal services to al qaida included driving and acting as a bodyguard for a man he knew to be the leader of an international terrorist organization
1749730 the charges he was cleared of on wednesday two of conspiring with al qaida to attack civilians destroy property commit murder in violation of the laws of war were the only charges against him in the first prosecution attempt
1749731 after the 200 im i felt like someone just kicked me in the stomach
1749732 i hate to lose i hope to correct that i still have a month to train and beijing is going to be a lot different
1749733 when i get in the water with him the last three or four times you know its going to take a world record to win im fortunate to be able to race him he makes me race even faster
1749734 it could have gone either way im glad he swam the race he did because it helped me out
1749735 i think we can expect more than we did a few months ago and thats exciting
1749736 we feel like weve been an underdog since the last olympics and through the world championships on the ladies side we still feel like that we have a lot to prove when we get there and we have to get better but weve had some great swims
1749737 these are some of our fastest times ever as a whole
1749738 it sets up hopefully to have one of our best olympics there are a lot of countries that are going to step up because its an olympic year hopefully we can be the best and fastest team ever
1749739 were very excited to come out of our last game of this tournament with a win and playing with a lot of heart and fight berg 28 said after the grand prix defeat of china
1749740 thats what well need in the olympics everybody on the team contributed we will take this into the olympics and fight every match
1749741 i was jumping wheelbarrows at the barn as a kid said the mendota heights resident who was named to her first olympic team last month
1749742 someone gave me a pamphlet about the u s combined training association i was hooked
1749743 im surprised at how excited everyone is for me im amazed at the support
1749744 ive been saying my goal is to make the finals ill be tweaking the technical part of my jump during training so i can put myself into position to do well at the olympics and then whatever happens happens
1749745 i think it will take a jump of 47 6 to make the final on aug 17
1749746 i dont feel like i had a great jump at trials i think i can go a few inches farther
1749747 i always act like i won but ive never ever won goucher said unembarrassed by her glee
1749748 winning was a huge accomplishment for me said goucher who plans to compete in both the 5 000 and 10 000 in beijing
1749749 four years ago was probably ground zero for me it was a low time but obviously something was still there i never stopped believing
1749750 inner monologues that made her mind as fragile as her body
1749751 i ate a lot and i gained a lot of weight she said
1749752 there were times when i asked myself am i crazy
1749753 i learned to appreciate my running so much more because of that there was always a little hope in me i never completely flamed out my first year working with alberto when i ran 15 17 which seems so slow now i was like theres still a fast girl in there somewhere
1749754 it proved to me i can compete with anyone on any given day but this is like im an olympian this is the childhood dream
1749755 shes been a starter ever since i was very young said torres now 41
1749756 i looked at her and smiled and said here we are again
1749757 i was very anxious very nervous torres said after clocking a time of 54
1749758 i wasnt expecting to be that nervous it felt like my first olympic trials
1749759 age is just a number i have great coaches and great people around me im able to recover and at my age its all about recovery
1749760 i told officials i wanted to be an open book said torres who has had 12 to 15 tests since march
1749761 you can dna test me blood test me urine test me whatever you want to do because i want people to know i am doing this right i am clean and i want a clean sport
1749762 i swam against swimmers who were dirty my entire life its just something i wouldnt do its a real pain but i asked for this and i want to prove im clean i need to prove that a 40 year old is doing this clean and doing it the right way
1749763 im really proud of her the way shes handled herself the hard work shes put in shes earned this
1749764 i talked to her after the olympic trials and told her nobody can ever take this away you are representing the united states at the olympics i dont think it will even hit her until later
1749765 it wasnt in the cards for us to take jakes two sisters said deitchlers father jason
1749766 the coaches called us up and said well do whatever we can to help the support weve gotten from so many people is really humbling
1749767 we couldnt go to the olympic trials so we watched it on the internet said kathy koob one of the founders of the ali cats
1749768 pretty soon 20 people showed up at our house and huddled around the computer to watch it with us weve watched ali since she was a little girl and we know how much she loves wrestling and the blood and sweat and tears shes put in were all cheering for her

1749771 het gebruik van het teken was duidelijk vanaf het begin toen ik te horen kreeg dat de militairen het konden gebruiken op spannende momenten
1749772 i met a very nice girl there who worked at one of the stands at the tournament that sell puzzles she was quite interested in the cubing tournament and i felt pretty attracted to her
1749773 so instead of waiting nervously for your next solve and over focussing i was a bit distracted by something else the result was no more nerves for the competition
1749774 i have to say the last step where you usually take about 12 moves to finish the last part of the cube was only two moves on this solve but its almost impossible to break the world record without this luck nowadays
1749775 i couldnt really believe it before the competition it actually looked like i was a bit out of form
1749776 getting the world record back again is unbelievable after the last record was broken twice i thought i couldnt catch up with the faster guys
1749777 with a good and lubricated cube most people would be able to do quite some turns in one second

1749784 this work helps connect our psychological understanding of why we like some things and not others with the genetic mechanisms that define our range of behaviors
1749785 in the ongoing discussion about how much the environment versus genetics determine behavior this study points to how the interaction between these factors influences our judgment and decision making
1749786 we were surprised to see that variation in the creb1 gene would account for more than 20 percent of the difference in how healthy participants weighed different options and expressed specific preferences
1749787 our previous studies and the work of other groups suggested that variation in this gene could be important for judgment and decision making by the brain but we needed to connect this to a measurable decision making effect in both behavior and brain activity
1749788 this study connects quantitative measurements across three levels of observation brain activity genomic variation and the expression of preference we now are investigating the potential role of other genes and will go on to assess how this relationship across three levels of observation may be affected by conditions such as depression and addiction
1749789 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
1749790 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1749791 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1749792 a husbands job is to earn income a wifes to take care of the children
1749793 a change in attitude is not the same thing as a change in behaviour but attitudes do matter
1749794 women particularly mothers can experience considerable strain when attitudes reinforce the notion that employment and family interests conflict
1749795 if we are to make progress in devising policies that encourage equal working opportunities for women we need to know more about what gender roles people view as practical as possible and as fair
1749796 plays a key role in understanding how electronics work how all sorts of interesting materials behave how light behaves during communication by optical fibers
1749797 when you look at all the technology governed by quantum physics its not unreasonable to assume that if one can apply chaos theory in a meaningful way to quantum systems that will provide new insights new technology new solutions to problems not yet known
1749798 this type of common behavior has been a signature of classically chaotic newtonian systems mostly studied using a computer but it never had been observed in an experimental system that only can be described by quantum mechanics
1749799 when you have a chaotic system that is characterized by extreme randomness it paradoxically can produce ordered behavior after a certain amount of time
1749800 there is strong evidence that is happening here in our experiment
1749801 when things get atom small our notions of being able to put a specific particle in a specific place with a specific speed at a specific time become blurry
1749802 although they are held in place in the crystal structure the spins can interact with each other and change the direction in which theyre pointed in much the same way that magnets interact with each other when brought close together
1749803 somehow despite the fact these spins have very complicated interactions with each other and started out in completely different orientations they end up all moving in the same way after several milliseconds
1749804 thats never been seen before in a quantum mechanical system these guys are dancing together
1749805 the basic principles behind neuro eye therapy are similar to those of physiotherapy following a stroke if muscles are affected following brain injury patients are asked to repeat a pattern of limb movements in order to improve their mobility
1749806 in the same way after daily use of the vision rehabilitation programtm over a six month period patients have reported an improvement in their sight as well as a range of other benefits including being able to get about more easily both inside and outside their homes and finding reading much less of a struggle
1749807 the device used in neuro eye therapy is simple to set up in the home or office and requires no prior expertise or experience of computer use
1749808 the daily task involves looking at a computer screen and deciding whether or not an image is presented within the blind area by pressing a button initially patients can only guess whether the image was presented but over time patients experience an improvement in their vision
1749809 the output is a very clear understanding of what the system should look like the project has developed an entire system concept and a related reference design for a future air interface this can be used as input for the standardisation process that is now starting
1749810 no one had anything to lose and therefore we could start a joint development of a new system where everyone could bring in their ideas
1749811 we started more or less from zero so everyone could gain something
1749812 our industry partners went to the lte standardisation and many organisations have taken winner results because we already achieved some consensus there these kinds of projects are supporting consensus building
1749813 basically youll get in a wireless system a similar experience as in your office or your home
1749814 in europe this may not happen before 2015 though in some countries it could be earlier
1749815 it really depends on conditions in different countries and also on market needs of course
1749816 asia is still growing fast but in ten years they will also have a saturated market the need then will be to improve the capabilities of systems from an industry perspective we have to offer innovative solutions in order to stay competitive in the global market
1749817 i think we have to work hard of course but there is a good chance because we have the people the know how and the means for this kind of co operation
1749818 what industry has to do is invest in research and development in order to stay inventive
1749819 technology is always moving its always improving we can decide either to be in the group which is improving and innovating or we are not in that group i think its better to be in the group thats improving
1749820 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
1749821 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
1749822 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
1749823 weve got to get out of the habit of thinking that we only need to focus on improving the technology that we can invent our way out of this situation
1749824 weve got to do everything we can think of including reducing the size of the task by real conservation
1749825 that last task is very important because unless youve got lots and lots of vehicles with the better technology the impact is limited
1749826 the need to bring better technology into production and build up volume inevitably makes the time frames for technologies to make a difference long optimists want to move faster but its not clear we can really do it much faster
1749827 transitioning from our current situation onto a path with declining fuel consumption and emissions even in the developed world will take several decades much longer than we had hoped or realized
1749828 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
1749829 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
1749830 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him

1749844 were looking at fundamental science fundamental mathematics that in many ways are a mess of jumbled data
1749845 we try to give them a structure because as humans we make these inferences so much better when our data has structure
