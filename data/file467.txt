4670000 you take money from the oil company and youre a friend of big oil
4670001 something like this where you could have graphic photos involved can be very very tricky its certainly something that wouldnt sell well in the bible belt
4670002 im very proud of my son and what he was doing
4670003 he went from high school straight into the marine corps his grandfather was a marine and joining the corps was a desire of his for a long time
4670004 my fathers grandfather was sitting in the seats where ted williams hit the farthest home run so as a present to his grandfather daniel wrote the red sox and asked to sit in those seats they invited the whole family to fenway and put daniel and my parents in the luxury box
4670005 he was brave smart and kind and didnt deserve to die so young
4670006 he could have accomplished a lot in his life had he been given the chance its a comfort to know that he died fighting for something he believed in
4670007 i really pushed him to think about college first but we were at war and he really wanted to do this he wanted to serve his country
4670008 he was very honorable a kind gentle spirit quiet but with great strength he would have been a fabulous teacher
4670009 from there you are within five to 10 minutes of downtown
4670010 you can probably save up to two hours by using that airport instead of pearson
4670011 over the next six months or so we plan to add another two or three destinations and boston is definitely one of those destinations we hope to get to in the short term
4670012 its one of the locations that has a high volume of traffic between the two cities
4670013 the fbis fingerprint technicians brought science to bear where mere suspicion had prevailed
4670014 the reason why is because of what we did last year as a whole unit we are going to try and come out and put points on the board that is what we are coached and asked to do
4670015 the expectations and bar are set so high here not by you all media or the fans but just by the coaches and the team we have high expectations for this offense and this team as a unit with what we did last year i dont think we can live and dwell off that because that was last year like i said before there is a little bit of nervousness because of how high the bar is set here
4670016 i like the camaraderie around here especially in the locker room and on the field they have a great group of guys in the locker room i think that is all you can ask for coach bill belichick understands football and understands his players he puts us together as one and we come together as a team that is something you can respect playing in this profession and in this league
4670017 the good thing that i can say about our offense and i am speaking for myself is that you have guys who came in a little late last year with jabar gaffney myself chad jackson was hurt last year and wes welker came in last year
4670018 for us to have a whole offseason and training camp under our belts to really understand the offense is scary that is why i say i am nervous because there is really no telling what we are going to do the bar is set high and we will see what happens
4670019 they were giving the other guy a hard time seeing that he is a rookie i dont think i have to do a whole lot they took care of the dirty business but ill take care of him ill take him out to dinner or something
4670020 im from san diego so in offseasons and whatnot id run into rodney a couple of times
4670021 weve always admired each others play its going to be great to be able to play with him
4670022 i dont know how exactly it went down but i was obviously flattered when there was an interest
4670023 this was a place where it nearly happened four years ago when i went to denver i was extremely impressed then and i have always admired this organization from afar you come out here and you have star players all over with randy moss
4670024 to me the thing that has always impressed me the most is the way they play the game i think they play it the right way they embody the sense of a team as well as anyone that has led to their success and i think everybody in the league wants to be part of that never did i think denver would be my last spot but things happen and i am happy to be here
4670025 i think if you produce things like that happen that is what i will do i will just try and come out here and be the best that i can be and see where that leads us
4670026 if you have played football long enough it is all very similar concepts just different names for it
4670027 that can be hard because old habits die hard you go through a translation and see the defenses and say ok this is that they did a great job of getting me up to speed i didnt get a whole lot of sleep last night but i came out here and pulled it off for the first day it was good
4670028 we missed out on the fa cup final last season so this time we will try to win every trophy
4670029 we have the ability so we will try to develop and achieve even better results than we did last season
4670030 i believe we can do it because even though we have no new signings we havent lost any players either which is the most important thing

4670035 i know carlos very well and i know the way that he plays im looking forward to trying to put one over on him on sunday its an exciting prospect
4670036 for me personally i dont consider it a risk playing at old trafford because ive got to play my first match somewhere so why not sunday
4670037 i admit that i am not inordinately shocked at the idea of foreigners voting in county and city elections from the moment they pay their taxes respect our laws live on our territory a minimum amount of time for example five years i do not see in the name of what reasoning we could prevent them from voicing their opinion on the way their daily lives are organized

4670142 this is such a horrific incident it is hard to believe that a 7 year old would do this or could do this
4670143 but our investigation is pretty complete the investigators have no doubts in their minds that this is what occurred
4670144 its doubtful a small child could do that kind of damage
4670145 there is no evidence at this point that indicates anything other than what we reported occurred
4670146 we looked at it very carefully and consulted with the district attorneys office the medical examiners office
4670147 the way the evidence stands at this point everything points to the 7 year old including her admissions and the observations at the scene

4670160 i have found something at last that has and is proving itself organizationally and materially i could hardly believe the advance sfi commission checks being sent to me after only the first few weeks after joining the program the sky is the limit

4670210 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4670211 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4670212 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could
4670213 im thrilled with the way im playing but you cant relax until sunday night
4670214 i knew at the beginning of the week it was going to be a low scoring week

4670216 and i expect him to perform the same way i mean we wouldnt be friends you know me i dont get along with people who dont go after it it just doesnt work well
4670217 we dont have a weakness but if a team comes out and plays better than us or if we dont come out and play like we know how to play then we can lose
4670218 the problem is that once people have paid those upfront fees they have to decide whether to cut their losses and move
4670219 the thrift savings plan is a terrific retirement vehicle and it has very very low cost investment options
4670220 ive never had an easier race contrary to what people say
4670221 we come here for the edge and we love the edge but this is ridiculous
4670222 the place was so young and there was a lot of nut cases but they werent in charge
4670223 i expect us to have for the first time in 28 years at least one democrat in the congressional delegation
4670224 i expect stevenss chances of survival are better than those of young
4670225 i think the employees at that particular location should be congratulated
4670226 i think no doubt whats happening at gatineau will be encouraging
4670227 our priority is to continue to run an efficient operation to ensure that we can fulfill our commitment to provide customers the everyday low prices they expect from wal mart
4670228 u s workers continue to wait to get the same respect from wal mart
4670229 if higher wages better benefits and fair treatment are incompatible with way of doing business its time for the company to change which is what wal mart watch has been saying all along
4670230 theres not just horses out there theres other critters from the desert turtle in the south to the bighorn sheep in the north

4670235 the boom of the last four years mesmerized them to live beyond their means
4670236 in the past ten weeks i am getting five to six new patients every week with financial worries about mortgages loan repayments and credit card bills all in the age group of 25 to 40 they exhibit anxiety helplessness and depression some even contemplate suicide
4670237 the monetary policy actions that have been taken during the past 12 to 18 months following the financial crises in the west have dampened the overheated land markets
4670238 some effect on consumer credit and related purchases of durable goods is also to be expected the 93 percent rise in oil prices has however made it extremely challenging to manage inflation and growth
4670239 the indian middle class is now deferring purchase decisions because they are locked in the rising mortgage trap from multiple loans they did not anticipate this cash crunch they thought indias growth story would only go up up and up
4670240 they are no longer eagerly replacing their television sets washing machines refrigerators and cars for newer models in the market
4670241 fda has concluded that an adequate margin of safety exists for bpa at current levels of exposure from food contact uses
4670242 fda is the premier agency responsible for the safety of our food
4670243 fdas thorough analysis confirms that food contact materials containing bpa can continue to be used safely
4670244 clearly their effort was to minimize people being concerned about this
4670245 it just seems that whenever there is an opportunity to look at a new important issue they just seem to be siding with industrys point of view
4670246 if it doesnt get much more dramatic quickly i will extricate myself from the process

4670249 there is no credible evidence that airborne products will reduce the severity or duration of colds or provide any tangible benefit for people who are exposed to germs in crowded places
4670250 its important to note that this is a settlement over older advertising and labeling and has nothing to do with public safety
4670251 weve offered a money back guarantee for our products since 1997 and we have millions of satisfied customers a class action lawsuit sparked this matter were just one of many major consumer brands across america that are under assault by class action lawyers
4670252 the fact they got away with it for years is not a reason they should not be held responsible for it
4670253 even if airborne isnt doing anything for you believing it helps
4670254 i cant tell you the last time i had a cold
4670255 it is pretty much impossible to prove that it didnt prevent a cold if you dont get a cold
4670256 you work hard you get ahead and you dont stop
4670257 there is a job to be done and it is a good job because it pays it doesnt really matter what my education was at home the opportunity is here and you take it and you do it and it will work out
4670258 with many immigrants there is this sense that they made this hard choice to leave their homelands and they are going to make it under any cost
4670259 i think theres a tendency to see the positive even under the most dire circumstances because so much is at stake theyve left family family members are counting on them and they want to make this work
4670260 it depends how simple it is to use these online tools
4670261 most physicians right now are on a hamster wheel they have trouble keeping up if it means extra work and its not a time saver theyre generally not interested
4670262 its not like financial identity theft where someone steals your social security number date of birth where you live you can fix that it takes time and its a nightmare but it can be corrected
4670263 there isnt any way to fix a violation of your sensitive health records

4670322 trying to send 20mp raw files back to the us through the communist internet out there
4670323 i heard the tv ratings are the highest back home for people watching the olympics and watching swimming
4670324 my goal of raising the bar in the sport of swimming is coming along nicely but its still going to take time for me to really get it to where i want it to be
4670325 this is the one time every four years where swimming really gets a lot of exposure
4670326 people who have no knowledge or interest in swimming get caught up in it ive seen it at work co workers know of my involvement in swimming and they ask me about it
4670327 were having a clinic right now and the kids are coming in in the morning and theyre talking about staying up late and watching the events the night before
4670328 the rest of the time swimming is not so much of a spectator sport but its not televised either its hard to find a lot of times kids find swimming on the internet and they come in and tell others they saw someone break a world record
4670329 and it gets them excited about getting back into the pool
4670330 were televising them whenever theyre on all day and late into the night
4670331 the customers definitely want it on people ask for it gymnastics and swimming have been the biggest so far the main gold medal events we put on the big screen
4670332 i prefer the summer olympics because you get a good mix of events swimmings been the highlight this year but its all fun its part of the whole get behind america again michael phelps is doing great and its nice to be part of it
4670333 would i go out of my way to watch swimming any other time of the year no unless it was the swedish bikini team aside from that im not going to watch swimming except in the olympics
4670334 i havent met them but ive been right next to them
4670335 the ones who know about us swimming at 5 oclock in the morning before school and all the crazy hours we put in other people dont know but its growing now especially in the u s most of my friends they ask me questions about it i feel like swimmers are getting more respect the olympics every four years thats what everyones swimming toward even if its for two weeks every four years its cool when people take interest in it
4670336 but im so glad its still going to be here i couldnt do without it
4670337 this was easier to walk into a place with inventory and customers in place
4670338 we like the neighborhood the foot traffic and we definitely dont want to lose the charm of this place
4670339 bittersweet but i want to take it easy for the first time in my life ive been doing this grocering since i was 12

4670350 this is such a horrific incident it is hard to believe that a 7 year old would do this or could do this
4670351 but our investigation is pretty complete the investigators have no doubts in their minds that this is what occurred
4670352 its doubtful a small child could do that kind of damage
4670353 there is no evidence at this point that indicates anything other than what we reported occurred
4670354 we looked at it very carefully and consulted with the district attorneys office the medical examiners office
4670355 the way the evidence stands at this point everything points to the 7 year old including her admissions and the observations at the scene
4670356 if there is new evidence uncovered of course well look at it
4670357 unfortunately everything points to the 7 year old as of this point there have been no new developments
4670358 this was described as rage for a kid to be enraged like that there would have to be obvious signs either previously or that day
4670359 i found due to the severity and nature of the injuries that she could not have been the one responsible
4670360 there were 13 instances of blunt force trauma on the head
4670361 to me the adult to be the individual who did it is easier to believe
4670362 the child belongs in the one stable environment she knows
4670363 my client is pretty much the only constant in her life
4670364 somebody is responsible and were suffering every day ever since june 6 while whoever did it is living their everyday ordinary life
4670365 i wish there was something i could do to bring them comfort
4670366 i guess there are questions but i dont have any answers for them

4670370 to visit the shuman juvenile detention center as soon as possible to view and re inspect the progress we have made
4670371 we want to impress upon them that we take this seriously
4670372 do not feel that issues that are brought to administrative staff attention are being addressed
4670373 im very optimistic about the direction that shuman is going
4670374 she was there all day every day for the whole spring up until the primary she would come in the morning stuff envelopes go home to eat and come back to manage our phone banks at night
4670375 shes a real nice lady and a hard worker its just that i guess she was supposed to be working someplace else
4670376 i dont think anybody knew she had another job she was supposed to be at she couldnt have had another position somewhere else and still campaigned as much as she did
4670377 i was there a lot and she was there at least as much as i was
4670378 this book is a blatant attempt to discredit barrack obama the author has made no bones about that
4670379 i told the president about six months before the soviets entered afghanistan that in my judgment i thought they would be going into afghanistan and i decided then and i recommended to the president that we shouldnt be passive we werent passive

4670382 the fire from jet fuel does not burn hot enough to produce the physical evidence that hes produced so when youve got science that the hypothesis doesnt explain evidence then the hypothesis doesnt stand anymore it doesnt mean theres a new hypothesis youve validated it just means the governments explanation of the jet fuel fire is not a sufficient explanation to explain the evidence of these spheres these microscopic spheres that steven jones has proved existed within the wtc dust

4670451 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
4670452 it looks to be an external sort of backup device a fail safe in it is stored all of the information of the timetrap but without the artificial speed and energy collecting capabilities its just memories really just dreams from a dream world
4670453 you introduced me as jane when we were in the past didnt you
4670454 its possible that the fail safe contains everything that was once all around us and everyone and its possible that having met him for the first time in the past this is how your memories were created and retained by mr urbina its possible javis that hes in there waiting for you
4670455 1957 a good enough year the wars are over for now you two will no doubt have quite an enjoyable life together
4670456 you wont itll be moments for us but a lifetime for you congratulations miss nine
4670457 youll get to do what not many of your kind get to do live more than once
4670458 doctor why are you doing this that man he was a bad man wasnt he
4670459 just a confused young man who wanted to help who would do anything to make the world a better place weve all been there weve all wished for it but there is no changing the way of things
4670460 you knew he was going to kill himself didnt you
4670461 i knew he was going to die i didnt know how
4670462 i i was there i lived it doctor i lived a life so many years how long have i been gone
4670463 but thats impossible all of this is impossible i i grew old i died and then i came back through the door and im me and here and thats not its gone now isnt it
4670464 but yes the energy is gone now that world is gone now

4670472 the world had caught me pleasure greed and indifference and finally even the vice that i had always despised and derided as the most foolish of all craving for possessions
4670473 the best things in life come from your own happiness
4670474 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
4670475 girl you better get back to your seat cos im fixin to write you up
4670476 mommy why is that man eating that other mans face
4670477 because you are my help i sing in the shadow of your wings
4670478 while it sounds very erudite for the authors to refer to withdrawing futile care in their population what exactly this means is neither defined by them nor is there a generally accepted meaning of this term in medical or medical ethics circles
4670479 as a result of these problems this paper is more disturbing than groundbreaking perhaps that is because in fact the ground it breaks the elephant in the room if you will is the elephant of taking vital organs from living patients so that others may live
4670480 once it is determined that it will be acceptable for a family to have artificial life support discontinued not using viable organs wastes precious life saving resources
4670481 using the organs to preserve life has to be ethically better than wasting them particularly when it costs the lives of other babies
4670482 the best things in life come from your own happiness
4670483 first reported that the animal was shot by a former felon and the men followed it into the woods
4670484 they found a family of bigfoot in north georgia mountains
4670485 the two were hiking and stumbled upon the corpse with open wounds

4670489 i like solving puzzles using visual elements to answer questions but it lacked the human touch
4670490 archaeology combined what i like physics people traveling outdoors and teaching
4670491 east timor is untouched by any archaeologists as it has been ravaged by years of war against indonesia for independence since i am always interested to explore different places i went for it
4670492 all tensions were resolved and this indicated that the people trusted us
4670493 even though i am an archaeologist i must ask the people what their concerns are and tell them what we are doing all the time
4670494 its something i dont like to do because im shy but funding for research and securing exhibits come from them
4670495 that is something people do not know about museum curators they associate our job with dinosaurs fossils
4670496 its so painful i have to force myself to sit down and write it and the worse thing is i am a procrastinator
4670497 we had a small and stupid museum budget task due the next day and he was annoyed about having to do it he decided to go sailing that afternoon he ended up burning the midnight oil
4670498 i dont work on weekends anymore but it is hard because my job demands 50 60 hours per week and i love all my projects and work so much i dont want to give up any well except for the meetings
4670499 we have group meetings once a week during which he listens to our activity reports then develops a summary that is humorous and concise these summaries make us seem like we are working as a tight happy team even though we mostly work on projects individually
4670500 i have to be 100 percent prepared and fully engaged as students depend on me for information and pay for me to do a good job
4670501 not an easy grader and always gave plenty of readings but he is not unreasonable
4670502 he is focused on helping students develop their own ideas and opinions through discussions instead of lectures
4670503 im sorry but i cant baby sit isabel down with a flu
4670504 i am interested in how early humans looked and how westerners have depicted foreigners in the past
4670505 when i drive down the viaduct i am always amazed at the changes that happened and try to imagine the earthquake that dropped seattle 35 feet and a tsunami that ate whidbey island
4670506 i will be praying please dont let that happen now
4670507 i want to become a boat builder a journalist or open a restaurant
4670508 i need change in my life to stay interested and engaged

4670511 he knows youre nervous man he knows you have stage fright and hes probably laughing inside
4670512 those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat it
4670513 aw nah man who does this punk think he is talkin to us like that look at him with him nasty hair lick and his salami shoes
4670514 oh man sorry reuben i dont really have any cash to go to lunch i think we just better get back and go home
4670515 well thats okay i can just pay for you i dont mind
4670516 aw no man i cant let you do that cause i cant really pay you back and i would feel bad
4670517 well i thought we were going out to lunch and i want to go and im the one thats been driving around town all day we are going to lunch

4670523 if larrikins do not respect inoffensive people they must take a hint from maces pupil
4670524 when you develop a new test for something it usually has to go through a fairly rigorous examination does it really do what it claims to do
4670525 bruce like most people in the lab derived most of his strains from outside sources
4670526 you have less confidence in how much the fbi is really sharing and how accurate this might be
4670527 to know what challenge youre defending against is terribly important
4670528 if top fbi officials knew in 2005 that the anthrax used in the attacks came from dr ivins lab then why didnt they clear dr hatfill until aug 8 either they were unsure of the scientific evidence against dr ivins or they knew long ago that dr hatfill was not the killer
4670529 i dont want it to reside in the court of public opinion then well end up with something like the lee harvey oswald case
4670530 there will be too many people in whose minds the case is never closed
4670531 the fbi try to confirm their hunches whereas a scientist tries to refute his or her own conclusions
4670532 the whole point of science is to publish it so that other people can tear it apart
4670533 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer
4670534 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
4670535 it was later proven that tamiflu was in no antidote for h5n1 and its side effects were sometimes very severe
4670536 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it calls the inevitable bird flu pandemic which they say could kill half or more of all americans and similar numbers of people around the globe
4670537 one of the highest rates of injury and illness of any industry
4670538 dangerous chemicals blood faecal matter exacerbated by poor ventilation and often extreme temperatures
4670539 an experiment mating h5n1 avian flu viruses and a strain of human flu in a laboratory produced a surprising number of hybrid viruses that were biologically fit a new study reveals
4670540 the work suggests that under the right circumstances and no one is clear what all of those are the two types of flu viruses could swap genes in a way that might allow the h5n1 virus to acquire the capacity to trigger a pandemic
4670541 terrifying biological weapons capable of killing only people of specific ethnic groups
4670542 the u s government is taking steps to minimize the need to make vaccine allocation decisions by supporting efforts to increase domestic influenza vaccine production capacity
4670543 two injections given 28 days apart may provide limited protection if a pandemic occurs
4670544 if h5n1 does mutate it is unclear if vaccines developed now would still work against a pandemic strain
4670545 three polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a number of homeless people died following medical trials for a vaccine to the h5n1 bird flu virus 15
4670546 the spanish flu influenza virus that killed 20 40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction
4670547 the 1918 spanish flu was highly infectious and in comparison to contemporary flu viruses killed a very high percentage of those infected including many younger people
4670548 despite the very dangerous nature of the 1918 virus efforts to reconstruct it started in the mid 1990s when dr jeffrey taubenberger from the us armed forces institute of pathology in washington dc succeeded in recovering and sequencing fragments of the viral rna from preserved tissues of 1918 victims
4670549 but after partially unravelling the genetic sequence of the virus the scientists went a step further and began bringing the spanish flu back to life unnoticed by the public they succeeded in creating a live virus containing two 1918 genes that proved to be very lethal in animal experiments
4670550 a resuscitation of the spanish flu is neither necessary nor warranted from a public health point of view
4670551 were tempted to say that nobody in their right mind would ever use these things
4670552 sanofi pasteur the vaccines division of sanofi aventis group announced today that the us department of health and human services hhs has accepted h5n1 bulk vaccine antigen to produce approximately 38
4670553 donate 60 million doses of h5n1 vaccine to the world health organization who over 3 years for the establishment of an h5n1 vaccine global stockpile
4670554 the h5n1 virus is currently circulating in some of the poorest regions of the world and an outbreak of pandemic influenza would most likely hit populations living in areas with limited access to vaccines this donation of h5n1 vaccine aims to address the needs of those most vulnerable populations in addition to supporting the efforts of governments
4670555 it is essential that industry collaborates with international organizations such as who the bill and melinda gates foundation and other global health players

4670557 the transformation of poultry production in asia in recent decades is staggering in the southeast asian countries where most of the bird flu outbreaks are concentrated thailand indonesia and viet nam production jumped eightfold in just 30 years from around 300 000 metric tonnes mt of chicken meat in 1971 to 2 440 000 mt in 2001 chinas production of chicken tripled during the 1990s to over 9 million metric tons per year

4670561 its my passion its like candy for me i love it
4670562 we are now positively identifying the man arrested in boston as clark rockefeller as the man known as christian karl gerhartsreiter
4670563 detectives have learned the male arrested in boston using the name clark rockefeller is the same person known as christian gerhartsreiter and used
4670564 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4670565 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4670566 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4670567 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4670568 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4670569 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4670570 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4670571 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4670572 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4670573 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4670574 quer amos dar una imagen perfecta y pensamos en lo que ser a mejor para la naci n
4670575 era una cuesti n de inter s nacional la ni a ten a que aparecer ante las c maras deb a ser expresiva
4670576 lin miaoke es excelente para todo eso pero en cuanto a la voz yang peiyi es perfecta todo el equipo estaba de acuerdo
4670577 my friends we have reached a crisis the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war this is an act of aggression
4670578 the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
4670579 i used to think i needed to make time to go on the stairmaster now if i have just 20 minutes ill jump on and get it done i feel better afterwards
4670580 i thought denver would be my last stop but things happened and here i am
4670581 the thing thats always impressed me the most is the way they play the game
4670582 he is a guy i have admired for a long time his playing style and his production he has been a great player with different organizations and with nine pro bowls
4670583 im kind of nervous the reason why being what we did last year as a whole unit
4670584 were going to try and come out and put points on the board because thats what the coaches ask us to do the expectations the bars set so high here not by you all and not by the fans but the coaches and the team we have high expectations for this offense and this team as a unit but what we did last year man i dont think we can really live and dwell off that
4670585 it has a drop ramp and it can be locked
4670586 the doors approached by mr gibbs were shut and locked
4670587 gibbs fleeing from court officers pulled on the entrance doors several times with all his weight and using extreme force caused the wooden doors to be forced open
4670588 i just want to be able to work and get off on the right foot lets stop wasting the taxpayers money
4670589 i hope this is the end i just want to run the police department
4670590 the suit alleges at least some of that difficulty was caused by intentional decisions by the town and people working on its behalf
4670591 take over a meeting and publicly castigate the chief in a demeaning and threatening manner
4670592 ive been eying that location for years and finally i said its time we do it
4670593 its time to kind of kick it up a notch
4670594 i think its kind of been a long time coming
4670595 you come off a series against texas where it feels like youre scoring 12 runs a game
4670596 but he did a good job a real good job he came out of nowhere and put us on the map
4670597 i tried to help a little bit but i cant
4670598 so im pretty much done for the year ill help them out a little bit throw some bp and help out the guys in the bullpen
4670599 hes been trying to fight through it the last three weeks
4670600 weve tried to fight it in so many different ways but the only way to do it is through rest
4670601 its sad but youre not always going to win the championship every year
4670602 weve had to deal with a lot of injuries here as a team its not easy
4670603 with his knowledge weve got a lot of young pitchers on our staff hes been helping anyway so thats a good thing
4670604 he tried to pitch through it a couple of times but you could tell you could see it because he uses his legs a lot
4670605 he said it depends how my body reacts as to when he returns he said it usually takes two or three weeks but were going to wait a week get treatment and see how i feel i hope i can come back earlier than two weeks
4670606 hes going to give it a week but weve only got about two weeks of the season left
4670607 we might have to bite the bullet its not something where hes going to injure himself permanently but if its painful then obviously he cant do it
4670608 and if he cant do it well just have to go with what weve got weve got a lot of young pitchers and a lot of young hitters too we dont have the experience a lot of these other teams have
4670609 i dont need to push him i want to get him healthy well see
4670610 many municipalities have gone to a four day week its practical and in some communities it reduces energy costs by 10 percent ive heard
4670611 its certainly worth looking into id rather go to a four day workweek than cut services or raise taxes
4670612 i would say anything we can do to save the taxpayers money reduce costs is worth looking into
4670613 i dont think the cost of energy is going down precipitously
4670614 we should look at every opportunity to maximize savings improve service levels nothing should be off the table particularly today
4670615 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4670616 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4670617 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings
4670618 for this to come out on a friday afternoon just before california takes action it definitely raises some eyebrows
4670619 members of our armed forces traveling on official orders should not have to bear any cost whatsoever associated with that official travel
4670620 our men and women in uniform deserve our utmost respect and gratitude not additional unnecessary paperwork
4670621 while we have not seen an official letter from senator clinton we have responded to the vfw commander advising him that the majority of ata members have re evaluated their baggage policies for military personnel on active duty orders
4670622 its the opportunity to pitch a couple of times before the end of the season
4670623 were pushing for a major league opportunity an affiliated opportunity he obviously needs to pitch
4670624 too many people trying to tinker with his mechanics and not let kyle jackson be the pitcher he is and he had too many roles it was just difficult
4670625 hes a local kid and we made every attempt to get him into a pride uniform we wish him the best
4670626 he was the first person to call me asking about jacksons availability
4670627 the red sox organization is stacked for him to be on the 40 man roster for two years is quite an accomplishment
4670628 gerhartsreiter is at the center of the longest con ive ever seen in my professional career
4670629 as prosecutors we need more than a photo and a fading memory to walk into court and amend a complaint
4670630 the fbis fingerprint technicians brought science to bear where mere suspicion had prevailed
4670631 it was the most ridiculous press conference ever the familys already identified him
4670632 when youre in an airplane you dont want your fuel to start solidifying
4670633 so we have a bit of a chicken and egg problem
4670634 were looking for something that is so correct in its performance that it can be interchanged with petroleum based kerosene
4670635 from a distribution standpoint from a technical standpoint it needs to fit without modifications or special handling
4670636 it can be grown anywhere you can have a pool of water and expose it to sunlight
4670637 if anyone is below 50 a gallon id be stunned
4670638 we have a pretty good idea on how to grow algae the biggest challenge is in the harvesting and how to extract it from the water
4670639 you arent going to find a fuel thats pennies on the dollar than what we find today
4670640 even if we were to double the volume we were to make in biofuels every year for the next 10 years were still looking at maybe this will impact 15 percent of the overall fuel supply
4670641 realistically for anything to be happening at scale enough to actually impact an airlines bottom line were years away
4670642 in some cases these people lost their homes everything they owned including their memories
4670643 i am asking fema to include merrimack county and strafford county in the disaster declaration based on the concentration of damage in those communities
4670644 ill also be asking fema to reconsider extending individual assistance to the families who suffered considerable damage to their own homes
4670645 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4670646 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4670647 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4670648 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4670649 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4670650 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4670651 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4670652 all you ever read about is that at six weeks you have your check up and then youre good to go
4670653 it never occurred to me that i could have permanent damage but i think i do
4670654 shes never treated it like it was anything unique it was just par for the course
4670655 it was a year post partum and she didnt seem to think it was weird that i had any pain
4670656 nobody ever tells you that you can sustain massive damage in a vaginal birth its apparently fairly usual in a labour like that for there to have significant damage
4670657 its not like my situation was unusual which was surprising to me
4670658 i could say your bladder could prolapse you may have painful intercourse forever but i dont think thats really appropriate if theres an individual case that veers from the norm then you have to sit down with the patient
4670659 some will still have problems with pain and difficulties with their bowels bladder and intercourse that may go on for a longer time its variable
4670660 a lot of it depends on what they go into their delivery with what kind of shape they are in if they are overweight how stressed they are their anxiety levels those kinds of things will slow them down
4670661 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4670662 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4670663 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4670664 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4670665 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4670666 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4670667 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4670668 you know a lot of times voters have to depend on what politicians want them to know politicians control their message you know through pollsters they use attack ads you know and the idea with vote smart is that you can get unbiased unpartisan information and not worrying about weeding through it and whether or not you can trust the information
4670669 we interpret agecroft as a house of the landed gentry rather than the aristocracy
4670670 that date between 1485 and 1660 and the furnishings are all of this period
4670671 one of my favorite things in the house is the series of romayne panels carved with faces
4670672 theyre all at eye level in the wainscoting on the west wall of the great hall and im really enamored of them they give us such an intimate glimpse into the people who lived then
4670673 its just lovely and i enjoy working here very much
4670674 it may be said quite simply that no other house of the mid seventeenth century in new england has survived in such unbelievably unspoiled condition it is extraordinary that so early a structure should preserve such a high percentage of original features
4670675 it was common to move the kitchen out to the lean to
4670676 we dont have that here because the hall is incredibly intact and was used for cooking the whole time
4670677 i can only assume that the dresser was used for storage and thus survived
4670678 its interesting that through the hall we can trace many of the changes in the technology of cooking over the years and we actively interpret these
4670679 we plan to be very cautious about how we handle it
4670680 most of the wattle and daub is still behind the paneling
4670681 i know for a fact that there is movement in the house because i see things in the collection that are adjusting as they vibrate
4670682 vibration can only have a negative effect on any early building
4670683 here at fairbanks house im the first preservation professional that has ever taken care of the house
4670684 it wouldnt be here if generations of fairbanks hadnt preserved it
4670685 we are a museum and the last descendent in 1904 was living with things from the 1600s 1700s and 1800s
4670686 our interpretation looks at the additions to the house over time
4670687 we have a very rich point of view that scrutinizes the children the men the women and what kind of work each performed
4670688 from experience and from his passion for sailing he knew what to look for when purchasing paintings for his collection
4670689 ive watched people in the field stand before glens collection for the first time
4670690 it was a great privilege for me to be sponsored by such a well respected yachtsman and even further to receive glens encouragement in 1991
4670691 when i was asked to join the clubs fine arts committee of which he was a member
4670692 ive been boating for many years at least a few decades now
4670693 it was my wife janice who took me sailing for the very first time
4670694 glen and i spent a lot of time together in new york and when he visited new england he would stay with janice and me
4670695 we were close friends and we frequently socialized outside the business
4670696 we would speak at least three times per week about things coming to the market
4670697 we always discussed whether great pictures were right for his collection
4670698 many of these pictures brought world records purchases like these cant be done arbitrarily
4670699 it was the barn and land that attracted him to the place
4670700 the house was in poor shape structurally and was furnished in the style of the 1950s
4670701 and supplied us with the pictures of both the house and barns
4670702 i am particularly attracted by the beauty of an object its craftsmanship and history
4670703 gone from a stage of barbarism to one of decadence without achieving any civilization between the two
4670704 the most fashionable as well as pleasant way in the present day to entertain guests is to invite them to evening parties which vary in size from the company sociable soiree to the party par excellence which is but one step from the ball
4670705 should be furnished with a view to convenience richness and comfort
4670706 in writing an invitation for a small party it is kind as well as polite to specify the number of guests invited that your friends may dress to suit the occasion to be either too much or too little dressed at such times is embarrassing
4670707 for a very pleasant social affair the rule is not to have the company when seated exceed twelve in number none of them should be conspicuously superior to the others and all should be from the same circle of society
4670708 be dressed and ready to receive your quests in good season as some in their desire to be punctual may come before the time appointed it is better to be ready too soon than too late as your guests will be embarrassed if you are not ready to receive them
4670709 for the early part of the evening take a position in your parlor near or opposite to the door that each guest may find you easily
4670710 as each guest or party enters the room advance a few steps to meet them speaking first to the lady or if there are several ladies to the eldest then to the younger ones and finally to the gentlemen
4670711 do not leave the room during the evening to see a hostess fidgeting constantly going in and out argues ill for her tact in arranging the house for company with well trained waiters you need to give yourself no uneasiness about the arrangements outside to the parlors the perfection of good breeding in a hostess is perfect ease of manner for the time she should appear to have no thought or care beyond the pleasure of her guests
4670712 bread should be cut in thin slices and laid on a napkin on the left of each plate place glasses at the right of each plate
4670713 commence dinner with raw oysters then a choice of one or two soups
4670714 no more than two vegetables should be served with each entree and potatoes should not be offered with fish
4670715 i like that you can channel that aggression toward being a racehorse then you just have to be lucky and hope she can be fast
4670716 if i lose to her im losing to a good filly and if she loses to me she knows shes losing to a good filly
4670717 ive always had a fondness for what is commonly called national league ball or smallball but here at coors field that style of play hasnt worked working closely with the manager were trying to make the team over into a power hitting club
4670718 if you were president what would be the first thing you would do
4670719 you dont have to wait until youre president to do that you can come over to my house and mow pull weeds and sweep my yard and ill pay you 50 then ill take you over to the grocery store where this homeless guy hangs out and you can give him the 50 to use toward a new house
4670720 why doesnt the homeless guy come over and do the work and you can just pay him the 50
4670721 donations may be made at the lower ground level of the medical city in the name of francis magalona

4670724 pull those pants up flint is setting up expensive video cams to watch
4670725 our legal counsels have been studying the ruling and weve decided to take the conservative side and implement it
4670726 its not something we collect for western union but we pass it to the government
4670727 they ofws could go to their mayors and congressmen to lobby for them to be exempted from the dst
4670728 we are constantly reviewing our pricing it depends on the efficiencies of the market
4670729 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
4670730 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
4670731 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
4670732 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
4670733 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4670734 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4670735 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4670736 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4670737 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4670738 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4670739 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4670740 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4670741 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4670742 well i went to baclaran church with my friends and i lit a number of candles praying not just for this cover but also for other things and to give me the strength to go on with this project
4670743 actually kinakabahan ako kasi pag pasok ko palang sa imperial suites hotel i feel like im walking to the valley of death but probably its just on my mind
4670744 naging comfortable eventually magaling kasi si jun de leon eventually i became comfortable because jun de leon is a good photographer
4670745 they dont have violent reactions and i explained to them the reasons why i did it
4670746 i am happy tama na yung iyak iyak sa mga nakaraan di ba
4670747 parang im just so happy with myself and im celebrating it its like im so happy with myself and i am celebrating it
4670748 i know that winning against de la hoya is going to be tough but i have full confidence in what i can do and i know i can score an upset
4670749 theres going to be lots of money involved but i also have to settle something personal with de la hoya
4670750 the registration of the e jeepneys is much awaited and smooths the way for the full implementation of the climate friendly cities project particularly when we start scaling up e jeepney fleets around the country the full implementation of the project will hopefully steer the philippines starting with pioneering cities away from harmful fossil fuels and toward climate friendly sustainable renewable energy based transport
4670751 the problem of global climate change and worsening air pollution are a result of really bad environmental decisions made in the past the e jeepneys represent the range of technologies now made available for us to choose a cleaner low carbon development path spiraling diesel and gasoline prices prove that fossil fuels are not the energy choices for the future the e jeepneys represent the revolution toward clean renewable energy alternatives that must be implemented now and in a much larger scale by the national government

4670903 did you see the gift that guy from china just got
4670904 you never see anyone come back in this olympics and this guy was down three or four points
4670905 por mi mentalidad considero que soy m s un jugador de equipo que individual desde peque o me gustaba ver deportes de equipo lo que siento cuando juego para m pa s en copa davis o ahora es completamente distinto a lo que siento cuando juego para m aunque nunca dejas de representar a tu pa s
4670906 no tengo m s que palabras de agradecimiento a todos los espa oles de la villa me lo estoy pasando muy bien llegu muy cansado porque nunca hab a estado tanto tiempo seguido fuera de casa y todo me ha resultado m s sencillo con los compa eros
4670907 un partido importante contra un rival muy complicado en esta pista
4670908 ser un partido muy duro porque est sacando bien con una derecha incre ble
4670909 estar es esta final es muy importante para m despu s de la temporada que he hecho ganar una medalla ol mpica me hace muy feliz
4670910 robinho es muy buen jugador pero no s lo que ocurrir no es mi trabajo es un trabajo de la directiva de los hombres que manejan el dinero es un fant stico jugador que puede jugar en cualquier club del mundo pero estoy feliz con los jugadores que tengo
4670911 si perdemos contra el portsmouth no ser porque no est robinho ser porque no jugamos bien
4670912 i think the kids came out today and really wanted to send a statement
4670913 shawn has such an excellent floor routine i think shell let it out in the finals
4670914 tenemos que tener personalidad no va a ser diferente porque sea el madrid tenemos que tener nuestra identidad y no dar bandazos en funci n del rival
4670915 el madrid tiene una gran plantilla y tenemos que intentar parar sus cualidades pero el 30 por ciento de la atenci n va a estar centrada en el rival y el 70 por ciento en nosotros lo que nosotros seamos capaces de hacer que seguro que va a ser lo que se va a imponer
4670916 en las mejores condiciones para sacar el m ximo rendimiento
4670917 procuraremos estar acertados y buscar su desacierto creo que ser importante el hecho de que el primer partido sea en casa y buscar el plus de nuestro p blico
4670918 no vamos a llegar al cien por cien porque la supercopa llega en una fase de pretemporada en la que seguramente no estamos en el punto que queremos pero luego est la faceta mental y ah tenemos muchas ganas jugamos en casa y las piernas van a ir al l mite
4670919 no puedo haber miedo ni a jugar ni al rival ni a uno mismo tiene que haber m ximo respeto pero tenemos que tener personalidad confianza y una actitud positiva
4670920 nadie va a estar al cien por cien pero el que est en condiciones de jugar jugar
4670921 cuento con ellos en referencia a villa y joaqu n y creo que pueden seguir creciendo en el valencia y el equipo con ellos si se tienen que ir por circunstancias que son beneficiosas para todos se tendr n que ir pero a d a de hoy cuento con ellos y creo que van a estar defendiendo el escudo del valencia
4670922 es muy dif cil luchar por el podio en condiciones de seco y no sabemos c mo responder en mojado existe la previsi n de riesgo de lluvia para el s bado y domingo ahora lo que me interesa es quedar entre los siete primeros objetivo que veo factible

4670924 un vuelo controlado bajo la presi n de la luz solar
4670925 se deber an crear barcos y velas adecuadas para el aire celestial
4670926 la presi n de los fotones jug f tbol orbital con una pelota el mismo echo 1 hecha de una delgada pel cula mientras el sat lite se encontraba en rbita la luz solar arroj los fragmentos por todas partes
4670927 el a o de trabajo dedicado al dise o preliminar demostr que de hecho la navegaci n llevada a cabo utilizando una vela solar era una t cnica viable para la propulsi n de naves espaciales
4670928 algunos afirman que znamya 2 era una vela porque estaba hecha de un gran reflector liviano y se despleg de la misma manera que se podr a desplegar una vela solar
4670929 de hecho si me pidieran demostrar la tecnolog a de las velas solares y tuviera la restricci n de desplegar una vela solar desde una gran nave espacial dise ar a una vela como znamya
4670930 cosmos 1 fue una nave espacial impulsada por una vela solar desarrollada en su totalidad cuyo objetivo era volar nicamente bajo la influencia de la presi n solar con el fin de controlar la rbita de la nave
4670931 si todo hubiera salido como se plane la sociedad planetaria de estados unidos trabajando conjuntamente con rusia podr a haber sido la primera en hacer volar en el espacio una vela solar completamente funcional aunque limitada desde el punto de vista de su rendimiento
4670932 esta podr a haber sido la primera vela solar estabilizada por rotaci n en vuelo libre en el espacio
4670933 el dise o de estas velas es lo suficientemente robusto como para poder desplegarlas en una atm sfera o en un ambiente con gravedad y se lo puede aplicar a escalas para producir velas solares de tama o mucho mayor quiz s hasta 150 metros de cada lado
4670934 para el a o 2010 es posible que la nasa lleve a cabo un vuelo de prueba
4670935 nuestro principal objetivo es demostrar el exitoso despliegue de una vela solar de muy escaso peso en una rbita baja alrededor de la tierra
4670936 si y esta es una condici n de vital importancia ellos pueden medir la presi n solar habr n demostrado que la presi n solar es un medio fundamental de maniobra orbital
4670937 la rbita que tenemos disponible en esta oportunidad de lanzamiento es muy baja quiz s no podamos permanecer en rbita el tiempo suficiente como para que los efectos de la presi n solar se acumulen en un grado que se pueda medir vamos a tener que observar muy de cerca los datos del vuelo para ver si podemos realizar esta determinaci n
4670938 el xito ser a enorme para el futuro de la exploraci n espacial
4670939 las velas solares son el nico medio conocido para lograr vuelos interestelares pr cticos
4670940 nuestra esperanza es que el primer vuelo con velas solares estimule el desarrollo de la tecnolog a de las velas solares para que este sue o pueda hacerse realidad

4670970 the reason why is because of what we did last year as a whole unit we are going to try to come out and put points on the board that is what we are coached and asked to do the expectations and the bar are set so high here not by you all the media or the fans but just by the coaches and the team we have high expectations for this offense and this team as a unit

4670991 in the u s we have moved into a knowledge economy and the main tool is your brain the best possible aid to that tool is a vacation
4670992 the company doesnt have to give the employees any extra time off and it allows office workers much more flexibility
4670993 ok so its not ideal but if you want time off its the easiest way
4670994 if you can afford to do it id recommend it unfortunately many employees think its a bit strange if they dont have their nose to the grindstone all the time especially if they are funding the vacation themselves

4671013 i understand the working class people might need a raise to keep up with the cost of living but for senior executives its hard to swallow
4671014 i dont see any reason to penalize this very small number of employees simply because they are not in the union
4671015 given the state of the economy i dont think its a good time for any public servant to seek raises
4671016 its 9 percent over a three year period they shouldnt be penalized for not being part of a union

4671019 whenever wed have a reunion wed ring a bell at the mention of those who were gone and ill bet we rang that thing for frank at least a dozen times as years went by
4671020 believing he was dead i was tempted to ask exactly where are you calling from but i wasnt sure it would go over well at that moment anyway at our next reunion after all those years of ringing the bell for him you should have seen the faces when frank walked into the room
4671021 we ended up having dinner together what a delightful guy he was he enjoyed every minute of that reunion the only one he ever made and we enjoyed every minute of it with him

4671025 the roosevelt party ran on economic issues and didnt care whether voters were in favor of sex or against it on principle as long as they supported the new deal the mcgovern party by contrast has made social issues its litmus test economic conservatives have had a home in the mcgovern party as long as they support abortion rights and affirmative action but social democrats and populists who are pro life or anti affirmative action are not made nearly as welcome
4671026 beginning with its namesake george mcgovern in 1972 the mcgovern party has been trounced repeatedly by the nixon party not because of its economic agenda which the public actually prefers to the alternative but because of its unpopular stands on issues like race based affirmative action illegal immigration crime and punishment and national security
4671027 in fact the majority of americans including many social conservatives never ceased to support new deal policies which from social security and medicare to the g
4671028 note that almost all of the policy proposals that excite the american public are exactly the sort of old fashioned
4671029 a newer deal party that ran on this economic agenda could attract southern baptist creationists as well as marin county agnostics
4671030 id rather move to canada than share the democratic party with those people
4671031 unfortunately the upper middle class left with its unerring instinct for political suicide is probably incapable of seizing the moment and bringing more baptists and catholics into the democratic party because it has developed an almost superstitious distaste for religious conservatives
4671032 there would have been no progressive era without the followers of william jennings bryan and no new deal without the support of ancestors of many of todays protestant evangelicals and traditionalist catholics social conservatives having lost the culture war should be offered not only a truce but also an opportunity to join a broad economic campaign for a middle class america as many of them did between 1932 and 1968 when pro choicers and pro lifers unite in cheering the public investment and living wage planks at the convention of the neo roosevelt party we will know that the political era that began in 1968 is truly and finally over

4671043 self service kiosks have become a creative and effective means of reaching a range of consumers with a cost effective set of financial services
4671044 tools like these extend the capabilities of those selling financial services now the race is to see who really picks them up
4671045 with extol we have a lot more capabilities than other companies as a result were easier to buy from
4671046 what they do is send orders via spreadsheets attached to e mails in the past our clerks had to manually re key the spreadsheet data into our applications this was a very time consuming and error prone process
4671047 plus we have the benefits gained from accuracy and the fact that the data are available in near real time
4671048 in the past customers would send us their spreadsheets and two people were dedicated to manually inputting the data into our systems
4671049 now that we use extol to automatically create the forecasts from the spreadsheets a full half day is shaved off the process also this automated process eliminates a lot of typos
4671050 conservatism has been an intellectual home to people like burke and buckley the gop is the party that gave us lincoln and reagan it seems to me that its leaders ought to make it clear that they find what dr corsi is doing to be both wrong and repellent to have their movement and their party associated with such a figure would be a terrible thing and it will only help the cause of those who hold both the gop and the conservative movement in contempt

4671054 having spent several years trying to identify and serve the particular needs of the imaging industry we have become extremely familiar with the importance of specialized tools and were positive that customers of vertus and imagenomic will be very pleased with the pairings of these different programs they will have access to multiple powerful applications and all at a discount that will make the investment that much more feasible
4671055 photographers and art directors are relying on advanced imaging software tools to help provide a cleaner faster and more compelling photography deliverable for their clients and imagenomic is pleased to be a popular solution for many of these creative pros
4671056 we are very excited to work with vertus to bundle our software suite with fluid mask 3 there are distinct advantages to using these tools together as such weve created a super suite that truly enhances the workflow for creative and visual pros

4671059 warner bros decided to push the movie release from late 2008 to july 2009 so we asked ea about whether the game would also suffer a delay various sources claimed they were surprised by the news while the producer said the announcement came at an inopportune time indicating the game would also have to be pushed due to overlapping story lines outside of the already released book
4671060 first time we were down this path we felt like that was an objective of ours to have 50 to 80 hours of gameplay we ended up just making s t up so we could fill that model now i think our range for the player will be somewhere in the 15 to 25 hour experience
4671061 weve got multiplayer we think is fun that feeds back and forth
4671062 weve also got a strategy game you could replay this thing in really different ways its not a linear game by any stretch of the imagination we felt like that was a much more fun thing to do for a player i also feel like when i look at most customers most of them dont have 80 to 100 hours to dedicate to anything id rather have more people enjoy the game
4671063 the hospital in question brought this matter to the attention of the proper authorities for this investigation to begin
4671064 the case itself was investigated by the ohio board of nursing
4671065 this hospital should be complimented for doing everything they could to make sure this type of activity does not occur
4671066 this is a matter for the prosecutor who brought the indictment but we have safeguards in place
4671067 the hospital is just like a bank they have people who handle money and we have people who handle drugs
4671068 we just hope that our people do right and if they dont then our safeguards are there
4671069 its always a last minute thing so we really wont know until school starts
4671070 it takes that long for people to straggle in especially this month from a first indication it looks like we are in good shape and will be up the new school and all it has to offer is attracting students to our area
4671071 but with this new building and its capabilities and what our teachers can provide for our students we are always looking forward to getting started
4671072 open enrollment really impacts our schools because of the way we are funded
4671073 its really our only source of revenue based on the current numbers i dont see any difference in them we had approximately 100 leave and158 come in so there were 60 or so more coming than leaving obviously we have to watch our numbers they would be higher if we didnt have to close out some grades because we are full we can only accept so many
4671074 usually we have about the same numbers but you never know
4671075 we have a high mobility rate in our area some kids move or dont show up so it takes a week or so for us to get a solid fix on our enrollment

4671081 the graffiti and the condition of that bridge which sees 60 000 cars over the course of a day is deplorable
4671082 and its deplorable that csx refuses to do anything to improve its aesthetic value
4671083 i understand theres going to be a level of excitement which is great
4671084 its great to have that and thats prep for the regular season sometimes you look out in the stands and tumbleweeds it would be nice to have that energy level
4671085 as this thing gets rolling the newness wears off and it gets down to playing
4671086 ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason people can say what they want yeah there were discussions before i came here about going elsewhere and all that stuff i am happy to be here i really am
4671087 you cant shy away from that theres going to be a big crowd out there
4671088 the excitement that is being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come saturday
4671089 if we let down at all he could still throw the ball and the plays that he does know hell know how to execute them
4671090 hes only going to be in there for a bit so the fun the festive like atmosphere will be over very quickly im getting ready for a game and our players have to do the same
4671091 you obviously cant be unaware that brett favre is there youd be insane to say that
4671092 but what youre looking at every day doesnt change wed be fine just going along and working below the radar thatd be fine with us anyway we have some things that we really have to improve
4671093 and what im expecting is for us to improve from our last preseason game
4671094 most of the things were running are plays that hes run before

4671112 you can improve your gas mileage by around 3 3 percent by keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure under inflated tires can lower gas mileage by 0 4 percent for every 1 psi drop in pressure of all four tires
4671113 keeping your cars tire pressure at the optimal level is a small and easy eco tip that would help save a lot of precious oil if everybody did it the principle is simple an under inflated tire adds rolling resistance so the engine has to work harder to move the car best way to understand it is to imagine pedaling on a bicycle that has almost flat tires so its easy to see why we strongly recommend that you buy an inexpensive tire gauge and make sure to check once in a while if your tires are at the recommended pressure
4671114 fuel efficiency goes down one percent for every three psi of under inflation so driving on weak wheels will cost you at the pump as well ive tried to check my pressure every few months and have observed a difference in my mpg after i reinflate my tires
4671115 operating tires at lower than recommended operating pressure further degrades a vehicles fuel economy
4671116 there are a number of driving hacks which allow hypermilers to increase their milage ranging from over inflating tires to extreme drafting behind large vehicles its incredible really to think that by changing your driving habits you can get better mileage in a standard car than is typically advertised for a hybrid

4671153 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally

4671198 when the spiritual teacher and his disciples began their evening meditation the cat who lived in the monastery made such noise that it distracted them so the teacher ordered that the cat be tied up during the evening practice years later when the teacher died the cat continued to be tied up during the meditation session and when the cat eventually died another cat was brought to the monastery and tied up centuries later learned descendants of the spiritual teacher wrote scholarly treatises about the religious significance of tying up a cat for meditation practice

4671623 being a graduate student is like becoming all of the seven dwarves in the beginning youre dopey and bashful in the middle you are usually sick sneezy tired sleepy and irritable grumpy but at the end they call you doc and then youre happy
4671624 what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure
4671625 at the start you may have to do tasks specifically related to the funding contracts
4671626 graduate school is not primarily about taking courses you will take classes in the beginning but in your later years you probably wont have any classes
4671627 your success in graduate school and beyond depends a great deal upon your ability to build and maintain interpersonal relationships with your adviser your committee your research and support staff and your fellow students
4671628 since academia is a type of business you will have responsibilities that you must uphold you will be asked to greet and talk with visitors give demos show up to meetings get projects done on time etc if you are not well organized you will have a difficult time meeting those obligations there are many different time management and organization skills arrange the tasks in priority and you can find many books on those at your local bookstore
4671629 communication skills both written and oral are vital for making a good impression as a ph d student and as a researcher unfortunately not all graduate students receive training in giving presentations or writing technical documents which are different from english essays these are skills that can be learned its not easy but its well worth the investment if you need practice try giving informal talks at research luncheons joining toastmasters and studying good speakers to see what they do
4671630 confidence is the key to giving a good presentation and the way to gain confidence is to give good presentations here are a few basic points organization counts within the first few paragraphs or first few minutes tell me why i should read your paper or listen to your talk make it clear where we are going and what we have already covered make the text in your slides large enough so that people sitting in the back can read them for large presentation halls this usually means no more than 6 7 lines per slide and 28 point type minimum youd be surprised how many experts on visualization especially tenured professors give presentations with unreadable slides variety retains interest vary your pace tone and volume emphasize the important points look around the room throw in some video pictures or live examples dont stand in front of the screen and block everyones view youd be surprised how often people do this without realizing it point out the limitations of your work that helps your credibility similarly give credit where credit is due make friends with the a v crew running a v is a thankless negative reinforcement job if everything runs smoothly well thats what was supposed to happen so nobody says anything but if anything goes wrong the entire audience looks back at the control room help the a v people help you always check in early and test the equipment tell them what you are going to do in your presentation e g im running 3 video segments make sure you know how everything works long before you come up to the podium and thank the a v crew for their help after you are done writing papers and getting them published is vital for ph d students who want to get jobs in research after graduation your ability to write well significantly improves the chances that your paper will be accepted finally dont forget to communicate with your professors and your teammates keep your committee appraised of your progress one thing i do which few others do is write short 1 screenfull status reports which i religiously e mailed to my professors and team members on a weekly basis these serve as an efficient way of keeping everyone up to date on what im doing they are also a good way for me to record my progress if i need to remember what i got done during a six month period i have plenty of old status reports that i can read youd be amazed how appreciative professors and managers are of this simple practice i also throw in a different humorous quote at the end of each weeks report to reward people for reading it when you are working in the lab and you reach a milestone or achieve a result let people know about it bring in your professors and fellow students and show it off thats a win win situation it lets others know that you are making progress and achieving results and you get valuable feedback and advice
4671631 your adviser must be someone who can cover your area of specialization and someone you can get along with and if circumstances change to make another professor a more appropriate match to your needs dont be afraid to switch if that is an overall win
4671632 it is important to have a network get yourself noticed by other professors and industry people

4671634 terrorist groups often try to legitimize their actions by associating them with religion using words such as jihad
4671635 however a jihad also has peaceful and positive meanings and it is unfortunate if the authorities repeat it and strengthen the extremists use of the word

4671664 i have to warm up before i tune up thats something i never used to do
4671665 before games my pregame ritual takes so long i was talking to defensive line coach todd wash and he was like man i watch you warm up forever is that how you prepare for the game its torturous youre not tired
4671666 i have to get warmed up before i can really exert myself
4671667 there are some things in my minds eye i can still do and i see myself doing it and executing it but its not quite there
4671668 i have to be a little more mindful of special moves or things that i want to do its not quite as automatic as it used to be
4671669 kevin has already been in the wars hes been in the trenches for years he knows how to prepare for each year he doesnt have to do what second year defensive end gaines adams has to do
4671670 gaines has to learn that perspective learn the different moves and other skill oriented things
4671671 once you have that down you just perfect it you dont have to do it over and over you will wear yourself out once you learn it you condition you rest and you keep going
4671672 i eat baked chicken grilled fish things to keep me energized and not weigh me down i used to have one day a week when i would eat anything its kind of a hard habit to break
4671673 when its game time you definitely eat the pastas doing the things to make sure my body is where it needs to be on sunday
4671674 youve got to put your best stuff on film and im no different than anyone else
4671675 i have to prove myself just like every other guy on the team im fighting for my nfl life and a roster position it drives me to do the best that i can
4671676 we all have the ability to leave whenever we want to but when you dont feel like getting up and getting ready for a season anymore then its time to go
4671677 ive had a close experience with that and it seems like most people who retire like warren sapp say the same thing they didnt want to get ready for it again then you know youre done im not there yet
4671678 every day getting up on time and eating on time making sure youre dressed and ready and give yourself plenty of time to accomplish what you need to accomplish
4671679 when i was younger i walked in the gym and just did big movements bench squat do a bunch of big stuff and just get out and i was fine these days i do big lifting with a bunch of finite lifting i do a lot of balance and proprioception exercises i do functional strength stuff i do so much just to play this game still

4671687 nuevamente ha quedado al descubierto que violentar esa norma no tiene relaci n alguna con la pedofilia o la pornograf a infantil y nuestro estado debe hacer algo respecto siendo la nica salida la derogaci n de esta homof bica ley
4671688 s lo el prejuicio y la ignorancia puede ver delitos en relaciones homosexuales consentidas toda vez que ello no ocurre en el caso de los heterosexuales
4671689 the biggest driver well see in the market next week is the price of a barrel of oil

4671691 there will be some stragglers on the retail side but in general most companies are through
4671692 i dont think it matters what they say on the earnings front the broader issues for retailers are energy prices in general every time weve seen energy prices sell off the group rallies even when one retailer reports a negative number
4671693 every week we get some news that is not on the calendar but the tone seems to be improving within the financial sector
4671694 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4671695 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4671696 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4671697 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4671698 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4671699 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4671700 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4671701 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4671702 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4671703 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4671704 what better way to mark our 20th anniversary than to celebrate filipino talent no
4671705 we have had several meetings already thinking of how to celebrate differently and then we hit on this idea
4671706 i never imagined i would be standing side by side with these big stars
4671707 with more scholars in schools and families in the community were establishing our niche
4671708 were working on contingency plans but right now there are not any really good answers were going to have to pull something out of our hat
4671709 our concern is that this off the shelf program was being used as a band aid to cover up the inability of our own programs to teach basic reading
4671710 to end it now is going back to the behavior of before where we start up and stop philosophically i dont think we should be knee jerking this around
4671711 they have taken advantage of the olympics to persecute their foes
4671712 the biggest driver well see in the market next week is the price of a barrel of oil
4671713 unless we get some crazy m amp a activity on monday the only monkey wrench i see is some skeleton falling out of some financial closet or something heats up in georgia
4671714 its been on everyones calendar for years and nobody paid much attention
4671715 there will be some stragglers on the retail side but in general most companies are through
4671716 i dont think it matters what they say on the earnings front the broader issues for retailers are energy prices in general every time weve seen energy prices sell off the group rallies even when one retailer reports a negative number

4671718 give me everything you got and get the expletive out of the car
4671719 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4671720 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4671721 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles a year
4671722 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4671723 its going to be a big shock because never in history has taiwans team lost to mainland china in international play
4671724 for a long time we thought we had an advantage
4671725 i think in todays game at the most crucial moment chinese taipei perhaps the turn of events really rattled them mentally and that took them from heaven to earth and they didnt know what to do
4671726 you must help us these whores are demanding birth control and it violates our first amendment rights to prescribe it because it kills babies
4671727 wir haben sehr stark begonnen es dann aber vers umt das dritte tor zu machen nach dem anschlusstreffer des hsv haben wir nicht mehr den druck entwickeln k nnen

4671734 i love my kids and no one is more surprised than me

4671736 she was there all day every day for the whole spring up until the primary she would come in the morning stuff envelopes go home to eat and come back to manage our phone banks at night
4671737 shes a real nice lady and a hard worker its just that i guess she was supposed to be working someplace else
4671738 i dont think anybody knew she had another job she was supposed to be at she couldnt have had another position somewhere else and still campaigned as much as she did
4671739 i was there a lot and she was there at least as much as i was
4671740 i was up half the night with a 2 way mass evacuation of my gastrointestinal system

4671935 hizo una apuesta fuerte por m y tengo que retribuirle la confianza con buenas actuaciones
4671936 estoy entusiasmado porque el t cnico hace una apuesta fuerte por mi y tengo que retribuirle la confianza que me da con buenas actuaciones
4671937 esa fue una etapa rara en un pa s donde se juega con mucho rigor f sico fui para tener continuidad pero tambi n me sirvi en lo humano y en lo deportivo toda experiencia siempre suma
4671938 es cierto que el arranque no fue el ideal porque la idea era ganarle a defensa y justicia
4671939 hay que ganar en casa para cosechar los primeros tres puntos en el torneo
4671940 m s all de que se quedaron muchos chicos de la base del plantel anterior tambi n se sumaron muchos nuevos y el nuevo los andes ir apareciendo de a poco con una mezcla de todo lo bueno que hay en el grupo

4671945 we in higher education are out there fighting the fight but it is really the students fight
4671946 this is not my problem this is their education at stake ive got mine
4671947 no im not advocating riots or fires or shootings but i do think students should be out protesting and letting the legislators know how unhappy they are about this
4671948 they should do it in a very civil way but they have to do something
4671949 were going to have a good number of people at that meeting
4671950 its a little tougher to do because a lot of people are gone for summer but were making a real effort to get as many students as we can out there
4671951 obviously the governor and the legislature have some tough decisions to make in spreading out the limited resources they have
4671952 but at the end of the day i think students and their individual stories will show how important higher education is in the state and how budget cuts can hurt the future of these students their career goals and the contributions they could make to society
4671953 i think they are a little afraid sometimes to speak out to authority figures but they need to let the governor and the legislators know where they stand
4671954 they are the ultimate customers and the ones most affected its important that the legislature knows how they feel
4671955 years ago a student body president led this big procession of students and they went through two days of comments but it only turned the legislators against them
4671956 i support what the chancellor says but we need to coordinate what we do and it has to be in good taste
4671957 dumping pennies on the capitol lawn is that more for the media i think talking to our state senators and assembly representatives will go a lot further than a media stunt
4671958 thats not to say once the legislature starts meeting that were not going to get people fired up and go down there
4671959 but we have to communicate our message without turning anyone off

4671964 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
4671965 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
4671966 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
4671967 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
4671968 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
4671969 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
4671970 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
4671971 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
4671972 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
4671973 its not is too much information bad its how do you manage within an environment that does provide all information and will continue to provide all information
4671974 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
4671975 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
4671976 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
4671977 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
4671978 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
4671979 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
4671980 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4671981 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4671982 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4671983 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4671984 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4671985 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4671986 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4671987 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4671988 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4671989 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4671990 can you believe that shes got seventeen tattoos and she sings about the blues and shes suburban
4671991 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4671992 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4671993 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4671994 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4671995 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4671996 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4671997 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4671998 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4671999 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4672000 who are open to doing something on the production side
4672001 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4672002 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4672003 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4672004 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4672005 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4672006 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4672007 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4672008 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4672009 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4672010 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4672011 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4672012 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4672013 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4672014 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4672015 a character building guide for you and your ministry team
4672016 during little sufferings pray by making the invocation mary and
4672017 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4672018 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4672019 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4672020 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4672021 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4672022 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4672023 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4672024 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4672025 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4672026 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4672027 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4672028 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4672029 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4672030 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4672031 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4672032 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4672033 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4672034 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4672035 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4672036 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4672037 and it is essential that america and other free nations ensure that an embattled democracy seeking to stand with us remains sovereign secure and undivided
4672038 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4672039 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4672040 cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes
4672041 there will be a time and a place to deal with what the repercussions of all this is
4672042 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4672043 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4672044 at least 9 out of 10 on her triage story scale
4672045 well i have a reputation to uphold or these other male ives will jump all over me and eat me for dinner just for the fun of it
4672046 awe dont worry my dear you worry too much you re going to give yourself a heart attack

4672055 we have some lobster too which i was going to cook for dinner also
4672056 oh good because ive developed a terrible appetite in the last half hour
4672057 so have you found any evidence to follow up on from the crime scene that would help us hon asked sandy
4672058 well the staff did find a piece of material that looks like flannel or near something to it but it hasnt come back yet and we re hoping to find some dna
4672059 but i will let you know as soon as we get the lab tests back ok
4672060 great in the meantime i think that you detective ros should take a little time off and not worry so much about this homocide
4672061 have you forgotten that there was a fire next door and it ruined all of my clothes and all of my stuff in my apartment
4672062 well all the more reason for you to take some time off ive seen how you work and you never take any breaks or time off ever even if youre sick
4672063 oh you have all the answers now dont you chief sandy
4672064 well it would give you some time to buy new clothes and try to fix your place up again and you can always stay with me until your place is livable again

4672066 i can help you hon i dont mind and i do have some time left yet myself
4672067 are you suggesting we both take a vacation during an important homocide investigation
4672068 well not a vacation but you could use a day or two
4672069 well i guess you are right i have to get my place cleaned up and get rid of that horrible smoke smell
4672070 well only if you are really going to help me and not use it as an opprotunity to play more with me
4672071 aww now you are ruining my opinion of you my dear
4672072 that you are a smart enterprising young woman of course
4672073 why thank you chief sandy i will forever be endebted to you then
4672074 if you want to get to glen ellyn you should probably use 290
4672075 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4672076 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4672077 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4672078 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4672079 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4672080 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4672081 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4672082 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4672083 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4672084 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4672085 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4672086 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4672087 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4672088 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4672089 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4672090 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4672091 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4672092 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4672093 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4672094 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4672095 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4672096 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4672097 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4672098 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4672099 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4672100 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4672101 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4672102 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4672103 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4672104 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4672105 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4672106 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4672107 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4672108 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4672109 huh so thats what my friends were like when they were kids
4672110 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4672111 i hope you are having a good time little dolphins i am having a good time i hope you are having a good time
4672112 thats the good thing about being a reliever youre going to get another chance
4672113 it feels good to go out there and nail down the victory
4672114 pedro did everything we could ask of him given the stage of his career hes in
4672115 for me its all about executing a game plan and making sure i have a good command of my pitches
4672116 with the mets theyre the type of team that can get on you and before you know it things can snowball
4672117 5 se ales que indican que no deber as estudiar dise o gr fico
4672118 thats a little more pressure and im old enough to be able to handle it
4672119 i think it might be the most exciting 100 meters ever
4672120 has gotten the label now of someone who does not show up when the race is really on the line
4672121 if he gives those guys too much at the start hell never reel them back in
4672122 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008
4672123 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4672124 do unto others as they would have you do unto them
4672125 i cant smell your faith tonight friend where is it
4672126 disappearing like the middle class you ever gonna wash your face
4672127 he made a strange contortion with his cheeks as if he were gargling mouthwash then wagged his tongue at me glistening on the tip of his tongue were several razor blades he then rollled his eyes back in his head and with a gulp the blades were gone
4672128 you think i give a fuck about your parlor tricks you geek

4672130 i always like to remind the contestant whats behind door number one
4672131 ah someone loves someone doesnt someone laughs someone cries its a lifetime movie of the week whaddaya want from me
4672132 as he waved the razor blade to and fro as if he were some morbidly creepy gameshow model
4672133 about the envelope oh about the face thing oh were all the same friend underneath yes you and all your contemporaries
4672134 hey if you ever want some quality company on a friday night click your heels and say theres no place like hell
4672135 a mans fate is a mans fate and life is but an illusion
4672136 i dont think im the best forward in the world im just here to do a job for the team
4672137 he may be human but hes from a different planet
4672138 i want to change the sport of swimming i want people to talk about it think about it and look forward to seeing it
4672139 ive been able to accomplish my lifetime dreams and goals i always wanted to be an olympic gold medallist a professional athlete a world record holder and bob has taken me to all of those
4672140 i dont think im the best forward in the world im just here to do a job for the team
4672141 believing that for russia to sit at the top table it needs to re establish its imperial traditions and resurrect its influence over its neighbours what it calls the
4672142 in most of the rest of the world college football is a game and they love it
4672143 im happy because the worst thing that can happen is im going to have all the medals
4672144 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4672145 i will try to be very clear over the situation
4672146 we cant continue to perform this way late in the game
4672147 these were the ghostbusters girls that one i grabbed her ass cause i wanted to see what her reaction was
4672148 whats policy and method of dealing with complaints about harassment
4672149 but what im asking is more hypothetical and informational if there is a set comic con policy on harassment and physical and verbal abuse on con attendees and exhibitors and if so whats the specific procedure by which someone should report it and specifically where should they go
4672150 comic con has zero tolerance for harassment or violence against any of our attendees or exhibitors please report instances to a security guard or the con office in room xxx
4672151 it was very clear there was no doubt whatsoever that first arrival was michael phelps
4672152 everybody can say oh if peyton manning isnt playing the colts are a
4672153 i dont think anybody here believes that is it easier to win without peyton no its going to be tougher but if it happens well believe we can get it done
4672154 i think the bottom line is that i expect peyton to be back ive been with him everything is going like we expect it to
4672155 do i wish everyone was 100 percent healthy of course but in this business you have to be able to fight through it you have to be able to deal with injuries and go forward
4672156 i dont worry about that i leave that stuff up to the training staff
4672157 everybody has confidence in each other so we dont worry about that stuff
4672158 she has all the physical tools to continue to progress to higher and higher levels
4672159 shes tall has long arms and legs and has great explosiveness
4672160 although it may not be as obvious because she is a goalie she also has great swim speed and an extremely strong throwing arm
4672161 we fight for the front seat all the time but i dont always win
4672162 i dont think many african americans would just notice me playing on this level but hopefully i can get better so that it would bring more attention to it
4672163 i think if other african american people saw me playing then maybe they would try it out
4672164 its kind of like this old wives tail in swimming also that african americans had never been taught how to swim when they were little
4672165 beforehand coach bob bowman said it would be good for me if i lost
4672166 wen he said that i was fired up i said im going to go for it
4672167 i came wanting to win as many races as i could getting as many personal bests i could
4672168 i have seven out of seven so far i dont know what to say
4672169 it was just a great race to be a part of just a spectacle
4672170 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4672171 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4672172 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4672173 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4672174 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4672175 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4672176 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4672177 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4672178 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4672203 the demand for electricity is showing indications of slowing down
4672204 maybe this year well end up with three percent growth
4672205 possibly were getting the same output with a smaller use of electricity
4672206 the slowdown in demand for electricity is coming mainly from industry last year industry reported zero growth in electricity consumption
4672207 we do have the capacity to meet demand for electricity in the country and there is no immediate threat of power cuts of course there are critical periods especially in the latter half of 2010 and in 2011
4672208 sri lanka has no blackouts when almost the entire south asian region throughout summer had severe blackouts even now india has blackouts but sri lanka has not for the last six and a half year
4672209 we do have electricity supply no blackouts but electricity comes at a price
4672210 we are not the most expensive but compared with our competitors in asia electricity in sri lanka for manufacturers is the highest
4672211 they have rescued us war there has begun saakashvili it an aggressor
4672212 i would not be surprised if some ethnic minorities in china were offended by this but they are also accustomed to it
4672213 in the west we are obsessed with authenticity in such matters but its different in china id guess many chinese would not have a problem with it
4672214 i see nothing wrong exactly with where the children are from it is a tradition in china in terms of giving a performance
4672215 i think the fear for many is does harmony and unity ultimately mean assimilation and surrendering their own identity and autonomy
4672216 just sort of dont do that most of the time
4672217 on my honor i will do my best to do my duty to god and my country
4672218 citys dems turn left endorse ultra liberals for supervisor races
4672219 live and vote as we tell you because we know best
4672220 it is a trust based on broadly shared civic and religiously based principles concern for our parents for our neighbors and for the legacy we will leave for our children and those who follow
4672221 ive had second thoughts believe me ive been really nervous all the jokes from friends involve death
4672222 youre going to actually sit on my lap is that ok
4672223 are you going to ask me what i want for christmas
4672224 seventy eight percent of the car washes in new york city did not follow minimum wage or overtime and 86 percent failed to keep basic records
4672225 i worked 60 hours a week and i was only paid for 40
4672226 in the philippines the number is even bigger because virtually every internet user here has a friendster account
4672227 this would mean integrating portal services such as instant messaging and e mail and the addition of personalized start pages with non user generated content to create stickiness and greater engagement
4672228 at least 63 percent of their profits come from internet value added services while another 24 percent come from mobile clearly mobile social networking is going to be big as more startups are trying to target this
4672229 in 2003 they said that social networking would be a fad that would go away quickly but five years later it is still here and getting stronger there has to be an evolution in advertising that would create a two way conversation with the consumer companies have to be a part of the user experience and foster social interaction with their target audience
4672230 everyone thinks that if we automate the elections then all our problems will go away however if you look at the experience of the united states and other countries who have automated their elections the old problems still persist and new problems crop up
4672231 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
4672232 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
4672233 one that is continuing even after he admitted last week that he had an affair with ms hunter but denied that he fathered her child
4672234 emerged through public records and interviews with people close to mr edwards and ms hunter which suggested that their affair went on longer than mr edwards admitted and that the effort to conceal it by mr edwardss inner circle was much more extensive than has been reported
4672235 is significant because its source was edwards oneamerica political action committee whose expenditures are governed by u s election laws willfully converting money from a political action committee for personal use would have been a federal criminal violation
4672236 george bushs administration is promoting interests of candidate john mccain
4672237 defeated by barak obama on all fronts mccain has one last card to play yet the creation of a virtual cold war with russia bush himself did not want a war in south ossetia but his republican party did not leave him any choice
4672238 we never use cluster bombs there is no need to do so
4672239 cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw
4672240 russias use of this weapon is not only deadly to civilians but also an insult to international efforts to avoid a global humanitarian disaster of the kind caused by landmines
4672241 we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains
4672242 the old records seemed as fragile as glass bottles in the water cube
4672243 i wasnt that keen on swimming but now i switch to the sports channel every morning at 10 a m to see phelps swim
4672244 it is difficult since we dont even have a track in afghanistan
4672245 if we have a track like this i can also win an olympic medal its my dream to compete with asafa powell and tyson gay
4672246 my parents were born in the mainland and went to taiwan in 1949 it was their lifetime dream to come back to their ancestral home
4672247 we often play basketball together and yao has always been our idol
4672248 todas las acciones dirigidas a quebrar a la polic a nacional estar n destinados a fracasar porque tiene el pleno respaldo de las autoridades de gobierno
4672249 el comandante obleas le dijo al prefecto rub n costas que se deb a a su mando nico nacional y ese tema renuncia no pod a ni siquiera discutirlo en ning n momento el comandante se retir de su cargo hubo un cuarto intermedio en sala en la reuni n pero eso no significa que el cnl hubiera hecho renuncia a su cargo
4672250 i am touched by the overwhelming support it is no longer just a by election it is a lot more than that
4672251 this is not just any by election it is about the next malaysian leader
4672252 permatang pauh voters have a heavy burden they are deciding the destiny of the country
4672253 iraq weapons of mass destruction and the growing crisis of global security
4672254 not to assume that he is developing long range missile capabilities at work again on building nuclear weapons and adding to the chemical and biological warfare weapons he concealed during the unscom inspection period
4672255 boasted of being involved in the transport of wmd warheads to syria
4672256 the iraqis and my team had no doubt wmds were hidden in these areas
4672257 it is even useful to have positive accomplishments misperceived as failures to throw foreign governments and rogue organizations off the scent
4672258 we are indebted to the physicians and caregivers at peking union medical college hospital who have done such a wonderful job providing barbara with the medical care she needed
4672259 we are also extremely appreciative of the support we have received from people here in beijing the united states new zealand and around the world the prayers and support have been a source of strength for our family during this difficult time
4672260 sen mccain was raised in a family that understood the value of the word and i believe his testimony comes through in his actions and he doesnt need to wear his spirituality on his sleeve
4672261 we pray that you give sen obama peace of mind in this world of attention and activity
4672262 josh is a great friend and has really led the way for democrats in terms of faith outreach
4672263 the grassroots conversations weve held across the country our landmark evangelical meetings are helping to change our nation person by person
4672264 abortion is certainly a deeply moral issue but so is struggling to afford decent health care for your family or straining to put food on your table
4672265 the company also made new citiassist loan commitments of 1 8 billion down 1 compared to last year due largely to the shift in volume to the graduate plus loan product which was introduced last year
4672266 the signature student loan funded by rbs citizens n a is available to all qualified students attending schools within the states citizens bank has branch presence including connecticut delaware illinois indiana massachusetts maine michigan new hampshire new jersey new york ohio pennsylvania rhode island or vermont
4672267 ei siin paljon ehtinyt ymp rille katsoa kun oli niin v h n aikaa suorituksiin
4672268 joskus nuorempana halusin jo suunniteltua aiemmin uimaan mutta nyt siell saa olla niin paljon kuin sielu siet
4672269 uinti oli jo tuskaa jalkoja s rki mutta on hienoa kuulla kansallislaulu
4672270 olen niin onnellinen hermostutti ennen kisaa silti uin parhaan uintini ikin unelmani on ollut ett jonain p iv n olen olympiavoittaja ja nyt se on totta
4672271 kun l in k teni sein n tiesin olevani voittaja
4672272 on aikoja jolloin haluat vain ajaa kotiin tai istua altaassa ja voit vain toivoa ett jokin taikavoima veisi kotiin nukkumaan vihdoin palkinto kovasta ty st tuli
4672273 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4672274 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4672275 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4672276 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4672277 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4672278 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4672279 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4672280 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4672281 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4672282 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4672283 the deans secretary was back in about five minutes with a xerox copy of an ibm printout of terry orchards schedule
4672284 read it and think about how on every single page something incredible happens
4672285 of course if the numbers are overwhelming thats all going to be out the door
4672286 if were inundated with a bunch of civil unrest it doesnt matter how well we prepare if we get severe numbers its going to take us forever
4672287 its just ridiculous the thing looks like a dog pound
4672288 even if you only put dogs in there people will be complaining about it i think you ought to have the red cross and amnesty international come take a look at this thing
4672289 the city does not anticipate the need for widespread arrests
4672290 we had hoped the operator would comply with the moe order and clean up the exterior of the properties
4672291 at this time its critical for the city to do whatever is necessary so that these residents can resume some sense of normalcy in their neighbourhood after this traumatic event
4672292 i can confirm that there were two babies transferred up from the lethbridge regional hospital but flesh eating disease is a specific diagnosis and the organism was not isolated in either baby
4672293 they were both transferred up with significant infections but to say they are symptoms of flesh eating disease thats just alarmist kind of language
4672294 our involvement from the ministry is to see what is going on and theres been nothing to suggest a breach of proper infection control measures
4672295 we havent been able to find any reason why these babies developed the infection
4672296 will republicans turn out for mccain when a lot of republicans are libertarian
4672297 i am not as concerned about the returns on my investment as i am the return of my investment
4672298 we will do what we want we dont have to listen to what you say
4672299 there are concerns however that tinkering with the language in the law would lead to an undue expansion in the numbers of people admitted to hospitals
4672300 rosario brings a particular cache to this project because in addition to her big screen work shes also a known comic book fan
4672301 im going overseas for a year and hopefully ill be able to come back and get picked in the nba draft
4672302 this was hard because i was working out with the team every day and getting ready for the season
4672303 i violated ncaa rules and what happened went over the coaches heads a lot of people thought it was because of grades but i go to class every day
4672304 candice michelle had surgery on her twice broken collar bone and has been working out in tampa at florida championship wrestling raw is lucky to have the gorgeous candice who is a wisconsin tom boy at heart i hope randy orton follows suit and has his twice broken clavicle surgically repaired so that randy doesnt have reoccurring issues with it in the future from what i hear orton is lucky to be around to tell the tale of his recent motor cycle accident thank goodness for helmets
4672305 i have no idea what hbk is going to tell us sunday at summerslam but i hope it is that he is staying active at least on a part time basis the wwe and the wrestling business needs shawn michaels more than hbk needs to wrestle shawn makes everyone around him better and is still the best in the business for my money especially when it comes to performing in a major match
4672306 another tough week for some wwe talents who got news that they were being released i know that there are some really good human beings who will be soon looking for work and i sincerely hope that none of them stop chasing their dreams perhaps the cuts of the past two weeks indicate that several of the young talents from florida championship wrestling are on the verge of being called up
4672307 i have failed to convince some of my fellow board members and the administration of the injustice of the ib program but mostly this experience has revealed to me the depth of the moral relativism that exists in the world today continuing my position on the board would lend affirmation to that viewpoint and that is something i cannot do
4672308 were very optimistic youre going to see a permanent license in the very near future
4672309 this will go through the typical process well inspect and write up a report of any deficiencies found once we have that report drafted well determine what the status of the facility is and what licensing action we should take
4672310 to visit the shuman juvenile detention center as soon as possible to view and re inspect the progress we have made
4672311 we want to impress upon them that we take this seriously
4672312 do not feel that issues that are brought to administrative staff attention are being addressed
4672313 im very optimistic about the direction that shuman is going
4672314 but im so glad its still going to be here i couldnt do without it
4672315 this was easier to walk into a place with inventory and customers in place
4672316 we like the neighborhood the foot traffic and we definitely dont want to lose the charm of this place
4672317 bittersweet but i want to take it easy for the first time in my life ive been doing this grocering since i was 12
4672318 i saw my dad work his whole life he was here on the day he died
4672319 from every place i lived for the last four years
4672320 old salem is primarily a living history museum but if we can afford some environmental stewardship in this way we will do it
4672321 ginny really this isnt right lets find a legitimate spot
4672322 this makes me very uncomfortable and i wont want to ride with you again if you do this
4672323 the patient likely has resistant bacteria it is really important that we wash our hands after every encounter
4672324 my religious education did not take i can barely remember a word of hebrew i cannot pray
4672325 because scientific theories are true religious beliefs must be false
4672326 i believe this will be the great hunger of the 21st century
4672327 a faith that doesnt require suspension of the intellect but draws upon it while at the same time remaining a faith in which gods presence is experienced
4672328 in recent years the practice has crept in of pronouncing the god of israels proper name
4672329 as an expression of the infinite greatness and majesty of god the name was held to be unpronounceable and hence was replaced during the reading of sacred scripture by means of the use of an alternate name adonai which means lord
4672330 churchs tradition from the beginning that the sacred tetragrammaton was never pronounced in the christian context nor translated into any of the languages into which the bible was translated
4672331 i mean would you like me to help you move in
4672332 its a whole entire life packed into a very small space
4672333 how can you sit at your table and eat a product packaged by a pregnant woman has been standing on her feet all day
4672334 the younger generations of modern orthodox jews are seeking new meaning to their religious expression going beyond survival and anti assimilation and just text study
4672335 there have been countless individuals who have felt estranged from the orthodox community who have been in touch with us were getting hundreds of e mails saying that this has filled a gap
4672336 the conservative movement has hauled the orthodox establishment out in a way they hadnt anticipated
4672337 were not looking to horn in on the business were looking to expand the envelope so the kosher consumer can buy things that they feel good about
4672338 if the whole country keeps on praying we can bring down prices even more to even less than 2
4672339 god just impressed me to take them over to the pump and the rest is history
4672340 congress as usual is divided lord what else can we do
4672341 im not one to criticize anyones faith and i applaud everyone who has strong faith in anything however i think this is absurd
4672342 hey have you heard about this group called prayer at the pump theyre a prayer group that sprang up and they go to gas stations and they hold hands and they pray for lower gas prices otherwise known as the bush energy plan
4672343 this isnt political at all there are people here for mccain for obama there are people who are libertarian
4672344 its better to trust in god than to trust in princes
4672345 hes a guy whose message has met the right moment
4672346 you know that i never endorse nor campaign for political candidates neither is it my role to give political advice but i am a cultural observer and i do understand the unique stresses and responsibilities of public leadership so i try to help leaders when asked
4672347 for many evangelical leaders rick warren is either a little too naive or a little too shrewd
4672348 he is threatening to water down the essential message of evangelical christianity
4672349 and that is what causes people to grow a little insecure and concerned and maybe even disconcerted
4672350 the purpose of your life is far greater than your own personal fulfillment your peace of mind or even your happiness if you want to know why you were placed on this planet you must begin with god
4672351 has that gift of being able to popularize ideas that are in some ways commonplace
4672352 just a regular guy who may be americas most influential pastor
4672353 were finding more families who are coming into our churches and saying this is where the rest of my family wants to be now what are you going to do for my child
4672354 in years past a family would come in find out there was nothing for their child and leave
4672355 i would say that the majority of our parishes do address the special needs of people and certainly try to do all they can to welcome them
4672356 my sense is that if its a really easy way to include someone with a disability churches are generally open
4672357 if it involves educating the congregation if it involves the congregation needing to be tolerant these are the areas where i think we have a long way to go
4672358 where they can come out and socialize where they can come and feel accepted where they can come and know the lord
4672359 uma pol tica mais r gida de fiscaliza o de quem desobedece s leis da imigra o
4672360 a menos que trabalhemos juntos nos pr ximos seis meses n o teremos outra op o a n o ser introduzir um regime de vistos para o brasil
4672361 que permanecem al m do permitido e ou trabalham ilegalmente no reino unido
4672362 the deal is solid its happening its just going to take a day and a half instead of one day and unfortunately theres saturday and sunday in between so it wont be finished until midday monday its just logistics
4672363 she was there all day every day for the whole spring up until the primary she would come in the morning stuff envelopes go home to eat and come back to manage our phone banks at night
4672364 shes a real nice lady and a hard worker its just that i guess she was supposed to be working someplace else
4672365 i dont think anybody knew she had another job she was supposed to be at she couldnt have had another position somewhere else and still campaigned as much as she did
4672366 i was there a lot and she was there at least as much as i was
4672367 this is such a horrific incident it is hard to believe that a 7 year old would do this or could do this
4672368 but our investigation is pretty complete the investigators have no doubts in their minds that this is what occurred
4672369 its doubtful a small child could do that kind of damage
4672370 there is no evidence at this point that indicates anything other than what we reported occurred
4672371 we looked at it very carefully and consulted with the district attorneys office the medical examiners office
4672372 the way the evidence stands at this point everything points to the 7 year old including her admissions and the observations at the scene
4672373 if there is new evidence uncovered of course well look at it
4672374 unfortunately everything points to the 7 year old as of this point there have been no new developments
4672375 this was described as rage for a kid to be enraged like that there would have to be obvious signs either previously or that day
4672376 i found due to the severity and nature of the injuries that she could not have been the one responsible
4672377 there were 13 instances of blunt force trauma on the head
4672378 to me the adult to be the individual who did it is easier to believe
4672379 the child belongs in the one stable environment she knows
4672380 my client is pretty much the only constant in her life
4672381 somebody is responsible and were suffering every day ever since june 6 while whoever did it is living their everyday ordinary life
4672382 i wish there was something i could do to bring them comfort
4672383 i guess there are questions but i dont have any answers for them
4672384 tight inventory controls and a renewed focus on low prices that is attracting financially squeezed shoppers
4672385 i think everyone has to find a way to the middle i dont think posting black lists is right nor do i think badgering bloggers is right
4672386 be genuine think openly write down any and all ideas keep an open mind and be respectful of other peoples thoughts ideas and opinions
4672387 bloggers need to be clear about their preferences for companies that want to share information
4672388 i promise not to spam you and will treat you with respect
4672389 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4672390 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile

4672395 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4672396 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4672397 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile

4672407 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4672408 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4672409 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4672410 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4672415 i would not be surprised if some ethnic minorities in china were offended by this but they are also accustomed to it
4672416 in the west we are obsessed with authenticity in such matters but its different in china id guess many chinese would not have a problem with it
4672417 i see nothing wrong exactly with where the children are from it is a tradition in china in terms of giving a performance
4672418 i think the fear for many is does harmony and unity ultimately mean assimilation and surrendering their own identity and autonomy
4672419 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4672420 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4672421 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4672422 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4672423 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4672424 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4672425 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo

4672427 as though whitton and dyer had fabricated the entire event
4672428 this georgian bigfoot expedition has come under fire for good reason doubt is growing among the media and the number of fake reports are increasing there are reports of staged bigfoot sightings the situation is ripe for parody
4672429 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4672430 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4672431 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4672432 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4672433 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4672434 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4672435 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4672436 the world has enough women who are tough we need women who are tender there are enough women who are coarse we need women who are kind there are enough women who are rude we need women who are refined we have enough women of fame and fortune we need more women of faith we have enough greed we need more goodness we have enough vanity we need more virtue we have enough popularity we need more purity
4672437 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4672438 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4672439 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
4672440 the jobs that china is creating are low priced jobs
4672441 thats not the kind of jobs we want for our citizens
4672442 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4672443 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4672444 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4672445 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4672446 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4672447 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4672448 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4672449 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4672450 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4672451 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4672452 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4672453 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4672454 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4672455 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4672456 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4672457 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4672458 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4672459 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4672460 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4672461 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4672462 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4672463 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4672464 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4672465 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4672466 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4672467 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4672468 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4672469 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4672470 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4672471 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4672472 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4672473 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4672474 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4672475 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4672476 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4672477 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4672478 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4672479 i could not believe how comfortable i felt wearing this undergarment i had no chaffing or rubbing it just worked perfectly and for the first time i was warm
4672480 ill take you there if you willing to visit me here
4672481 he really was different from the others he was tall and heavy black skin curly hair
4672482 barack ran somewhere they went he ran somewhere else they followed
4672483 my hand would hurt when i hit it it was like iron that head
4672484 sometimes wed say barry do you want a chocolate and wed give him a chocolate the next day wed give him a chocolate again the third time wed give him terasi fermented shrimp paste wrapped up like chocolate
4672485 charlie brown claims that he puts the needs of american families first
4672486 he can prove that by joining me to demand that pelosi and congress finally act to develop american oil on american land right now
4672487 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4672488 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4672489 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4672490 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4672491 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4672492 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4672493 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4672494 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4672495 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4672496 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4672497 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4672498 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4672499 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4672500 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4672501 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4672502 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4672503 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4672504 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4672511 have you ever pondered as to why vampires are so breathtakingly beautiful
4672512 edward i feel so much you are my heart and in my heart is a lock that only your love can open our souls are so perfect when they merge in heavenly love why do you like me im so plain and unattractive and weak while you are so beautiful and perfect in every way
4672513 when you are near i actually know what contentment is every silence speaks a million words and the simple touch of your fingers makes me understand why we are here who we are and how we can truly live but why oh why would you ever want to stay with me i am ever so worthless and pathetic while you are a god of amazing proportions your every movement is blessed by your immortal greatness
4672514 hold me close to your cold skin that is so hard and cold and filled with cold heat of hardness let me feel your lips an inch away from me because we never actually kiss ravish me with your eyes because we never you know actually do anything remotely physical or anything probably because you know im so repulsive and you are disgusted by my very sight
4672515 what sorry i wasnt paying attention i was brooding about inner turmoil stuff based on how good you smell

4672519 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4672520 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4672521 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4672522 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4672523 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4672524 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4672525 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4672526 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4672527 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4672528 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4672529 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4672530 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4672531 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4672532 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4672533 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4672534 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4672535 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4672536 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4672537 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4672538 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4672539 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

4672543 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4672544 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4672545 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

4672550 if the foot seems too snug the whole sock will be too small
4672551 when a large company purchases a small company with no employees other than its founders typically to obtain some special talent or a cool concept
4672552 you take great talents and you put them in this big company and they get drowned out by all this policy stuff
4672553 putting a small company in a big company kills what was good about the small company
4672554 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4672555 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4672556 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4672557 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4672558 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4672559 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4672560 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4672569 so how did you end up being called lys dexia i mean is that a real impediment ive never heard of it and im pretty up on that particular subject
4672570 yes i imagine in time that your mamma glands might suckle a good many young
4672571 although my breasts are exceedingly fulsome for my age im actually referring to my singing voice it saved my life until i came here i used to singly nightly for my uncle frapflap hes with the extermination board
4672572 its time to get your drawers off boy and go boulder bouncing

4672617 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4672618 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4672619 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4672620 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4672621 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4672622 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4672623 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault
4672624 many had traveled in their nightclothes on rocky roads through the mountains and gave bloodcurdling accounts of georgian atrocities i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire alisa mamiyeva 26 a teacher in tskhinvali said from the safety of vladikavkaz in north ossetia
4672625 russia failed to back up its claims of georgian atrocities
4672626 coverage in the u s and europe is leaning heavily toward reports on the georgian casualties of russian bombing over the weekend few details are being given about the thousands said to have been killed when georgia attacked tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia on thursday and friday
4672627 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
4672628 one woman told how a family of four including two children tried to flee from a georgian tank but it fired on their car and they were all burned to death said angela who like all the refugees only gave her first name
4672629 she saw the georgian tanks roll into tskhinvali the soldiers shouting hail saakashvili who is the president of georgia they destroyed the city added inna 33 who said she could not understand how the georgian troops could do that to civilians
4672630 you see your friends home burning and theres nothing you can do you just watch and cry its a genocide inna said an old woman among the refugees said all she had left was the dress she was wearing my house is destroyed she said
4672631 i can just hear mccain barnstorming the country in 08 denouncing russian imperialism and demanding that we stop putin in the caucasus before russian troops cross the bering straits

4672633 it does only silver or wooden stakes or the weapons of the gods have any permanent affect if youre fortunate enough to possess them and we dont have either stakes or silver swords or those blessed by the gods
4672634 any living soul who doesnt pause in the face of these creatures is either a fool or already dead
4672635 in what belongs to the deeper meanings of nature and her mediation between us and god the appearances of nature are the truths of nature far deeper than any scientific discoveries in and concerning them
4672636 why the future of business is selling less of more
4672637 punish russia by moving the 2014 winter olympics out of sochi
4672638 the prospective host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
4672639 it is premature to make judgments about how events happening today might sit with an event taking place six years from now
4672640 all our efforts here in china are spent on learning from these wonderful beijing games so that we can enhance our offer for the olympic movement
4672641 at sochi 2014 our focus is to deliver an excellent and innovative games that will inspire the world we are on track to achieve this

4673015 if the chinese do not take steps to help stop the genocide in darfur and to respect the dignity security and human rights of the tibetan people then the president should boycott the opening ceremonies
4673016 i am also deeply concerned about chinas failure to support efforts to halt the genocide in darfur regarding the beijing olympics this summer a boycott of the opening ceremonies should be firmly on the table but this decision should be made closer to the games
4673017 in our policy toward china we have not been consistent enough and tough enough in pushing them to deal with tibet properly but also on their continued support of sudan a country that has been engaging in genocide against the peoples of darfur
4673018 its very hard to tell your banker that hes wrong

4673041 i have yet to see him offer any alternatives that would help the county
4673042 i read it three times because it was so unbelievable its almost an act of terrorism using the word chanjacked i will not vote for anyone associated with it please do not run it in the island park news
4673043 that ad while i agree with the message is lets say strong i am going to have to give some serious thought as to how i express my opinion on this election i think i am going to take your advice and stay away from any more ads you wont be getting an ad buy on this topic
4673044 i think the ad is further proof of a transplanted utah developer trying to inject himself into county politics and feather his own nest its also an example of what we can expect in the future by developers intent upon finding ways to further their own interests loosli and a few of his vocal supporters have constantly pushed the notion that it is i who has been suing the county and causing the commissioners to spend thousands of dollars in legal fees to uphold an illegal ordinance this of course is simply not true
4673045 im proud that smart growth coalition who represents the wishes of a large segment of fremont county voters reluctantly took steps to protect the people of fremont county
4673046 it was done only after it became clear that the commissioners would not follow the very astute advice of our county prosecuting attorney karl lewies the result to date the county has spent 85 000 in needless legal fees and as they continue to ignore the advice of our prosecuting attorney and support their illegal ordinance it will go much higher and lets not forget who is a primary beneficiary of the illegal ordinance none other than its author stephen loosli now ive been slammed by a phantom group led by this transplanted out of state developer who obviously believes that the voters of fremont county will believe him what is also obvious this group has wormed its way into county government and is working hard to influence the updating of our comprehensive plan and development code in such a way that our county will be filled with growth financed by the taxpayers as county commissioner i will continue to listen to my constituents and lead the battle to protect the best interests of all fremont county voters
4673047 in poor taste but good taste in political advertising is unusual if not an outright oxymoron the ad also happens to be factually accurate atchley did testify that he would sue the county if it persisted in breaking the law

4673146 were going out there and treating the preseason too much like the preseason
4673147 were going out there and thinking everything is just going to come when the regular season begins and were just out there playing snap for snap getting our timing and not playing up to the level were capable of playing at i dont feel thats ok
4673148 you go out there and have two teams run the length of field on us three times out of four series hell yeah thats concerning
4673149 i feel like our base defense is enough to do what we need to do

4673151 when youre not tackling you got to play basic football
4673152 its not just going to snap around and just come soon as september comes
4673153 you got to go out there and play these preseason games like its a real game no matter how long youre in there and i dont feel like were doing that right now
4673154 were going out there and getting our timing getting our plays in and getting out were not playing or coming out with the same attitude we come out with in the regular season
4673155 you got to show something in the preseason thats why we play the damn games
4673156 evidently theyre going to try to figure it out after they break down this game

4673165 its not something you expect to get you have to earn it and i guess my teammates felt like i did and im not going to let them down
4673166 but with his leadership he really stepped it up this summer when all the guys were together and i think thats what the kids recognized its a peer vote the coaches had nothing to do with it that says a lot about him being just a junior to be able to do that
4673167 thats just the way i play football ive always been like that if i played any other position on the field id still be like that
4673168 but i learned a lot from jo lonn and im not saying that to sound like every other guy
4673169 the kid played football the way it was supposed to be played thats the best way i can put it

4673216 it shouldnt be a partisan issue this is a fascist issue people who dont want voting and want fascist control and people who think theyre voting
4673217 theyre lying theyre lying diebold is lying there is no electronic system in the world that cannot be hacked there is no system in the world none that cannot be hacked i cant make it any clearer than this you cannot have secure electronic voting it doesnt exist if you had complete transparency in the process theres no reason not to use optical scanning you have a paper ballot people mark it you scan it very quickly into a system now at that point those need to have random sampling to compare the way the computer has actually recorded things to the handcounted paper ballots
4673218 i think theyre brilliantly designed theyre designed to steal elections there are backdoors in the tabulation machines which is what the us cert warning is about theres a backdoor communication that allows secondary computers to talk to the electronic tabulators electronically from a distance
4673219 im a republican i worked on giulianis campaign i worked on bloombergs campaign i worked on john mccains campaign ive been a lifelong member of the party this is not a democrat republican issue this is not a partisan issue this is a democracy issue if you actually care about a constitutional democracy in which each person votes that vote is validated and the people who end up in office are reflected on the basis of the way people voted you care about this issue
4673220 i certainly know that in all statistical information it seems that in every single bizarre circumstance where exit data polling data or informational data swings it has all been in favor of republicans but not the sort of republicans who i want to see in office at all these are people are people who lie and people who cheat this is not the conservative way conservatives conserve things we are respectful and we are constitutionally based

4673330 just as nightfall does not come at once neither does oppression in both instances there is a twilight and it is in such a twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air however slight lest we become unwilling victims of the darkness
4673331 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
4673332 you know a long time ago being crazy meant something nowadays everybodys crazy
4673333 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
4673334 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
4673335 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
4673336 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
4673337 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
4673338 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
4673339 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
4673340 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
4673341 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
4673342 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing
4673343 we are all born ignorant but one must work hard to remain stupid
4673344 a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise
4673345 living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do
4673346 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
4673347 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
4673348 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
4673349 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly

4673352 this appalling act was carried out by those opposed to the peace process
4673353 it is designed to wreck the process and everyone should work to ensure the peace process continues
4673354 it is possible and probable that they carried out this attack

4673358 im kind of nervous the reason why being what we did last year as a whole unit
4673359 were going to try and come out and put points on the board because thats what the coaches ask us to do the expectations the bars set so high here not by you all and not by the fans but the coaches and the team we have high expectations for this offense and this team as a unit but what we did last year man i dont think we can really live and dwell off that
4673360 any money that retirees take out of their portfolios or that they lose in market declines in the first five years of retirement has a higher cost because its money that wont be invested to earn returns in succeeding years when the markets recover
4673361 and the less they have invested after a bear market the less potential they have to benefit from the compounding of any earnings in subsequent years
4673362 thats a self imposed discipline that retirees would be wise to adhere to
4673363 there are a lot of folks who want to get a divorce and the house is an impediment because nobody wants it
4673364 its in inventory with homes that are just like it
4673365 id like to see you write a follow up on who should take advantage of this credit
4673366 being that its a loan it obviously isnt going to be economical for everyone
4673367 i am not in any way struggling to pay my mortgage and i dont have credit card debt
4673368 sure i need a lawn mower and i wouldnt mind the boost in my savings since my down payment wiped me out but is this tax credit really economical if i dont really need the money for anything except immediate gratification
4673369 dont miss what could be the opportunity of a lifetime to get into the home of your dreams
4673370 the nations home builders are confident that a new temporary 7 500 tax credit for first time home buyers will get buyers back into the marketplace and help end the current cyclical downturn in the housing industry
4673371 if someone knocked on your door and said hey i have 7 500 to lend you at zero percent interest and you can pay me back over 15 years would you take the money
4673372 probably not unless i had something specifically i needed the money for
4673373 when you point out that this is debt no matter how you slice it and that you are responsible for that debt i see it another way
4673374 of course i care about the issues in adoption i saw juno didnt i
4673375 hey yeah its not funny and its not funny when serious movies pull this shit either
4673376 there is no greater sorrow on earth than the loss of ones native land

4673387 even with respect to facebook users the beacon program did not obtain any consent prior to the communication of identifying transactional information to facebook
4673388 i think facebook is still trying to make beacon work and the roots of what they are doing make sense
4673389 but if people keep thinking that their privacy is being violated facebook has to listen to its users because without users there will be no facebook

4673527 i will survive with another sizeable hit the track subsequently took on a life of its own it remains popular in dance clubs and has appeared on countless movie soundtracks and dance disco compilations
4673528 few vocalists could match the sultry unfettered eroticism summer brought to many of her best recordings which seemed to embody the spirit of the disco era perfectly the total package made summer the ultimate disco diva one of the few whose star power was even bigger than the music
4673529 sir youre not supposed to be here your seats are up on the 3 rd floor
4673530 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4673531 you are dealing with a people who despise anything human
4673532 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4673533 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4673534 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4673535 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4673544 when youre a small child and you want to get your allowance you dont make daddy mad if you want to get your allowance
4673545 weve got a very low tax rate in cumberland county
4673546 its a wonderful place to live but you have to pay for the services you need to provide and weve not necessarily done that
4673547 everyone loves our community the community loves each other just because decisions get made thats not the general thought process of the people who live here

4673558 it is an extremely harsh and stark environment to detain people seeking asylum while their applications for protection are determined
4673559 the very expensive security systems of the facility are quite unnecessary for the population who may be detained there

4673567 physicians assistants will extend the capacity of our highly skilled medical workforce
4673568 we need to provide the best possible training for junior doctors and for doctors to gain experience they must have opportunities to see patients and do procedures
4673569 we are concerned if physician assistants are increasingly used they could be substituted for doctors in some of these roles and the training of junior medicos compromised
4673570 there were people at capcom who told me not to make this game
4673571 we have made an official protest its first place it is very important
4673572 i heard the tv ratings are the highest back home for people watching the olympics and watching swimming
4673573 my goal of raising the bar in the sport of swimming is coming along nicely but its still going to take time for me to really get it to where i want it to be
4673574 this is the one time every four years where swimming really gets a lot of exposure
4673575 people who have no knowledge or interest in swimming get caught up in it ive seen it at work co workers know of my involvement in swimming and they ask me about it
4673576 were having a clinic right now and the kids are coming in in the morning and theyre talking about staying up late and watching the events the night before
4673577 the rest of the time swimming is not so much of a spectator sport but its not televised either its hard to find a lot of times kids find swimming on the internet and they come in and tell others they saw someone break a world record
4673578 and it gets them excited about getting back into the pool
4673579 were televising them whenever theyre on all day and late into the night
4673580 the customers definitely want it on people ask for it gymnastics and swimming have been the biggest so far the main gold medal events we put on the big screen
4673581 i prefer the summer olympics because you get a good mix of events swimmings been the highlight this year but its all fun its part of the whole get behind america again michael phelps is doing great and its nice to be part of it
4673582 would i go out of my way to watch swimming any other time of the year no unless it was the swedish bikini team aside from that im not going to watch swimming except in the olympics
4673583 i havent met them but ive been right next to them
4673584 the ones who know about us swimming at 5 oclock in the morning before school and all the crazy hours we put in other people dont know but its growing now especially in the u s most of my friends they ask me questions about it i feel like swimmers are getting more respect the olympics every four years thats what everyones swimming toward even if its for two weeks every four years its cool when people take interest in it
4673585 i was a split second from not even having an arm and football being over to sit here and look at my arm the only time i dont think about it is when im on the field thats my peace being out there on the field when i dont have to think about it
4673586 i was finally in a groove and starting to have fun
4673587 hes been through some adversity and has had to persevere
4673588 anytime someone battles through injuries and comes out on top i think it makes you not only a better person but a better football player
4673589 it makes you a little hungrier at times i look in his eyes at practice now and ive never seen him so focused and so hungry he has a purpose this year he has a different look in his eyes a different swagger
4673590 hes under the radar until theres a deep crossing route and he makes a big hit people who play us know who eric thatcher is i know the media likes to talk about some of our other guys but hes a leader back there
4673591 at that position there is so much that goes into it from a mental standpoint hes the quarterback of the defense he makes the calls get us lined up we need a guy like that back there and were very fortunate to have him
4673592 its a position where you dont always get the accolades because youre not going to have 120 tackles or 15 sacks
4673593 youre going to be the guy who lines us up and gets us in the right position because of that we make the right play someone else might get the tackle or get the pick but it wouldnt happen without him
4673594 eric has improved and this could be a breakout year for him having said that i thought he had a really good year last year if he keeps doing those things were going to be a great defense
4673595 damn how did she stay sane through all of that
4673596 and i will ask the father and he will give you another counselor to be with you forever the spirit of truth the world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows him but you know him for he lives with you and will be in you
4673597 but the counselor the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name will teach you all things and will remind you of everything i have said to you
4673598 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you for everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds and to him who knocks the door will be opened
4673599 if you believe you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer
4673600 when an evil spirit comes out of a man it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it then it says i will return to the house i left when it arrives it finds the house unoccupied swept clean and put in order then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself and they go in and live there and the final condition of that man is worse than the first that is how it will be with this wicked generation
4673601 the seers will be ashamed and the diviners disgraced they will all cover their faces because there is no answer from god
4673602 you will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart i will be found by you
4673603 i am absolutely right and they all are wrong about god
4673604 i had a notion that somehow besides questing i was being pursued
4673605 night after night feeling whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work the steady unrelenting approach of him whom i so earnestly desired not to meet i gave in and admitted that god was god and knelt and prayed perhaps that night the most dejected and reluctant convert in all of england
4673606 i am the light of the world he who follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life
4673607 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father but through me
4673608 i have loved you with an everlasting love therefore i have continued my faithfulness to you
4673609 god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
4673610 behold i stand at the door of your heart and knock he who hears my voice and opens the door i will come into him or her
4673611 jesus thank you for dying for my sins you know my life and that i need to be forgiven i ask you to forgive me right now and come into my life i want to know you in a real way come into my life now thank you that you wanted a relationship with me amen
4673612 i know them and they follow me and i give them eternal life and they shall never perish and no one shall snatch them out of my hand

4673638 russian and georgian media reported several days ago that israel decided to stop its support for georgia after moscow made it clear to jerusalem and washington that russia would respond to continued aid for georgia by selling advanced anti aircraft systems to syria and iran

4673684 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4673685 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4673686 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4673687 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4673688 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race

4673690 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4673691 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4673692 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4673693 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4673694 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak

4673726 no its not so shocking so many of my expatriate friends tell me the same thing being here makes them lazy
4673727 when they first come here they like the sun so much they spend all their time in the swimming pool then they get fed up and try to look for other things but there is nothing or they say there is nothing everything is so sensitive except shopping
4673728 yes yes yes but why do you become lazy is it the weather or is there something in the drinking water or is it the air or
4673729 i dont know except that when i am in london i will have plenty of time to write when i was in singapore i used to help out in the national museum like many other expatriate wives they gave us six months training but here they are not interested in us i had so much to do in singapore
4673730 but that still does not explain why one becomes lazy when one comes here
4673731 well here everyone is satisfied with small things if they go for pottery classes they are happy if they can make a little pot for themselves they are not interested in finding out more in improving further for excellence there were many pottery classes before now most of them are shut when it comes to shopping they want the best they dont mind spending twenty bucks on a cup of coffee or a few hundred on a dress so they can look good but they do nothing to improve themselves they write a small story they are happy they make a small film they are happy direct a bad play and they are happy

4673737 m ore than other artists from the arts creative writers have brought more joy to nigeria with literary giants like chinua achebe and wole soyinka to mention a few winning international renown and prizes having their bestsellers translated into many foreign languages and thereby promoting our cultural heritage compared to the nigerian musician or actor the nigerian writer despite his intellectual edge is taking the backseat as far as financial fortunes are concerned
4673738 nigerian publishers are not helping matters too for most of them their work stops at the point when the books are rolled out from the press they do little or none of promoting and marketing their authors a few of them who attempt doing this only rely on book reviews on newspaper arts pages instead of advertising their books as is the norm in the western world
4673739 our writers are not making money is due to the fact that publishers themselves are not making money
4673740 judging from the foregoing the creative writer in nigeria is only a few steps removed from becoming an endangered species
4673741 i filed for divorce from return of the reluctant citing irreconcilable differences im a different person now when something stops being fun its pretty easy to become decisive

4673748 its a familiar sight at the entrance of every celebrated bookstore in the city you are assaulted by international bestsellers or new indian arrivals many of them mediocre works if you ask for something else youll hear sorry were out of stock

4673759 the novel s soul morality is knowledge a novel that fails to reveal some hitherto unknown bit of existence is immoral
4673760 the novelist unlike the poet or the musician must learn how to silence the cries of his own soul the writing of a novel takes up a whole era in a writers life and when the labour is done he is no longer the person he was at the start
4673761 i have long seen youth as the lyrical age that is the age when the individual focused almost exclusively on himself is unable to see to comprehend to judge clearly the world around him
4673762 every reader as he reads is actually a reader of himself the writer s work is only a kind of optical instrument he provides the reader so he can discern what he might never have seen himself without this book
4673763 i often think tragedy has deserted us and that may be our true punishment
4673764 its the failure of the series to expand and cultivate a writing culture among malaysians that killed the series off

4673766 why not if they sell why dont you publish them
4673767 we are not interested in that kind of stuff thats all they are mostly badly written in any case anyway there are other publishers who do that
4673768 but i want her to write something that will sell
4673769 look if you are thinking about your daughter taking up writing for money i think you should forget about it right now if your daughter wants to write she should write not for the money but because she wants to and if she does happen to make money good for her anyway a survey shows that authors of most bestsellers are in their fifties she is still young
4673770 unless you are deaf dumb and blind everyone knows how much money jk rowling makes
4673771 so the chances of your daughter becoming another jk rowling is one in several billions now if you go downstairs and buy a lottery the chances of you winning the first prize is one in three million wouldnt that be much better anyway your daughter has not even started writing
4673772 what advice will you give her if she wants to write
4673773 but what does she have to do if she wants to write
4673774 but i wouldnt advise it for her now not yet she has to start reading first she has to start reading widely all the classics all the modern masters
4673775 she cant spend all her time reading now and start writing only after she is fifty
4673776 whats going on here there are so many major issues all over the world and people here are only interested on who did what to whom
4673777 indian writers in english iwes are responsible for creating a body of literature in exile mainly written by writers and read by readers living abroad yes i know european and american readers like this shit it confirms their stereotype and ignorance and writers make a lot of money
4673778 whats an appropriate draw down rate what about inflation how do i budget for inevidable medical costs

4673782 youve got to pay taxes on those assets on the way out
4673783 two percent is bulletproof 3 is probably safe and 4 is the absolute maximum
4673784 youve got to pay taxes on those assets on the way out
4673785 its a bit blue sky to say that two and two are four so im planning for five
4673786 its a bit blue sky to say that two and two are four so im planning for five
4673787 whats an appropriate draw down rate what about inflation how do i budget for inevidable medical costs
4673788 give them enough that they can do anything but not enough so they can do nothing
4673789 how many people actually read reviews and why do they read them
4673790 but dont worry i will think of something to write
4673791 they havent stopped congratulating themselves after that one published short story yet and it will be ten years soon
4673792 keep your ear to the ground because there are some very talented young writers here and they are going to do very well
4673793 to say nothing of in house editing and a literary agents and publishers stringent perusal
4673794 to what do i owe the honor of this occasion
4673795 that and i just had to kiss you or go completely insane
4673796 i just couldnt wait any longer to enjoy your company
4673797 we really must stop ive a meeting with the aforementioned mr stetler in ten minutes regarding a similar situation between calleigh and her latest flame luis alvarez hed be awfully suspicious if i were to attend it flushed from our delightful diversion sigh i so want to just but we both know that isnt possible now
4673798 its far more possible than you know maam ive tendered my resignation effective in 30 days just so we can live happily ever after i know its not that simple it never is but i just cant take the constant tug of war between my love for you and miamis need for my services calleighs more than ready to step in and take the helm when ive gone ive spoken with chet about it and hes graciously made her immediate ascension possible
4673799 oh dear i didnt realize youd taken things that far and all for lil old me
4673800 im deeply honored that youd do that for me but is it wise
4673801 i could think of nothing wiser than my immediately disappearing from miami love since about half of her population wants me dead im leaving a fantastic group of csis to take up the slack people whove been waiting for their shot at the brass ring for a very long time i just didnt understand how important a good woman was to a fulfilling life until we met and married honey
4673802 it doesnt matter how good or bad the product is the fact is that people dont read anymore forty percent of the people in the us read one book or less last year the whole conception is flawed at the top because people dont read anymore
4673803 it is very obvious that amazons kindle is a huge flop in six months of travelling i am yet to see a single person on any bus train or plane with a kindle in their hands contrast that with the ipod or iphone or even the sansa where people can actually be seen using them everywhere
4673804 i still have not understood why anyone would pay us 350 for a device that needs to be powered up all the time to be in use just to read a book which otherwise costs us 15 on an average and its not like the e book is free on kindle you have to shell out an average of us 10 per book
4673805 attempting to sell people something for gbp400 that merely enables them to read something that they wont buy at one hundredth of the price seems to me a thankless task
4673806 donald graham chief executive officer of washington post co travels almost every week and says he hardly ever leaves home without his kindle digital book reader from amazon com inc

4673808 its reasonable to assume books will go the way of music or the dvd at some point with the majority being sold digitally
4673809 as microsoft backs away from digitizing old texts some worry that a single company could privatize world knowledge
4673810 should a single company be left in charge of putting all of the world s books online

4674006 it is beyond dispute that kennedy left the border station about 5 a m sunday nov 25 1979 approximately 29 hours before the body was found if the victim was killed after 5 a m kennedy could not have been the killer
4674007 this would put the time of death at somewhere between 6 a m and 9 a m monday nov 26
4674008 her killer is still free he is out on the streets he will strike again

4674017 indias commitments under the current terms of the proposed arrangement do not justify making far reaching exceptions to international non proliferation rules and norms

4674019 it will create a dangerous distinction between good proliferators and bad proliferators and sends out misleading signals to the international community with regard to npt norms

4674022 if nuclear testing is to be deterred meaningful penalties must be available if nsg states do agree to supply fuel for indias civilian nuclear sector they must avoid arrangements that would enable or encourage future nuclear testing by india otherwise you and your government may become complicit in the facilitation of a new round of destabilising nuclear tests

4674029 the plan was to go in and put everything on the line and see what i have to go home with im about to throw up im excited to hear the anthem play and for everyone back home to hear it it is such a relief i am so excited i am thrilled with the time im really loving what im doing im swimming fast
4674030 im very pleased obviously im a little disappointed everybody goes into the race wanting to win but its an improvement on my bronze in the 100
4674031 if it was up to me i would drop the protest
4674032 i dont want to fight this it is a gold medal at stake and it is a difficult thing to lose but i went into this competition to win bronze and i didnt win bronze i won silver this is what the electronic board showed i have mixed emotions about it if i had lost by a tenth it would be different but with a hundredth i will have people saying i won and that makes me feel good but i am completely happy
4674033 immediately after we got a protest from serbia questioning the arrival of their swimmer to be first
4674034 the serbian team was satisfied and agree with comments of the referee
4674035 if you are not happy you have room to appeal to the jury but they were very happy with the decision we made and accepted the decision
4674036 when i took that last stroke i thought i lost the race there but it turns out that was the difference im just lost for words
4674037 you know when i did take that extra half stroke i though id lost the race i think that the biggest thing is when someone says you cant do something it shows that anything is possible when you put your mind to it i feel a bit of everything relief excitement everything i had to take my goggles off first to make sure the 1 was next to my name thats when i sort of let my roar out
4674038 perhaps i was the only person in this competition with the ability to beat phelps one on one
4674039 this is a new situation for me i have never been under this pressure and i am very proud of myself keeping myself together and my stress level down it is frightening racing michael phelps and i know a lot of people had money against me i expected he would go a world record time it was a real honor for me to be able to race with michael phelps and be in a situation where all eyes were on me as the one person who could do it
4674040 if we got to do it again i would win it
4674041 i didnt realize she was here i would love to meet her
4674042 and i never knew it was going to be like this i just got in there and did my best its absolutely amazing ive worked so hard and its paid off i knew i could have swum faster but to get the world record it certainly paid off its so exciting i absolutely cant believe it its amazing to win gold and break the world record i cant believe i broke it
4674043 i wouldnt be here without bill furniss ive been with him since i was 12 or 13 i wouldnt have been able to do this without him
4674044 after yesterdays semi final when i broke the olympic record
4674045 i thought i could bring it down further i spent all day thinking about this but finally i stopped and was able to sleep well but it is difficult to have super swimmers around me like these two here but today was my lucky day the sun shone for me today

4674168 defamation law in the united states is much less plaintiff friendly than its counterparts in european and the commonwealth countries due to the enforcement of the first amendment
4674169 the supreme court suggested that a plaintiff could not win a defamation suit when the statements in question were expressions of opinion rather than fact in the words of the court under the first amendment there is no such thing as a false idea
4674170 the supreme court also established a mens rea or culpability requirement for defamation states cannot impose strict liability because that would run afoul of the first amendment

4674185 anti falling physicists have been theorizing for decades about the electromagnetic force the weak nuclear force the strong nuclear force and so called force of gravity
4674186 and they tilt their findings toward trying to unite them into one force but readers of the bible have already known for millennia what this one unified force is his name is jesus

4674200 that was the best moment for me in the match
4674201 that game where i was broken i missed every first serve and he took advantage
4674202 he played really well that third set he deserved to win that one ive just got to bear down when im cruising
4674203 i knew i couldnt play much worse than i played in the first set
4674204 at first i was too nervous and made too many mistakes
4674205 ill have a chance to play another semi so i want to enjoy this moment
4674206 hes playing like hes top 10 as hot as he is
4674207 i thought if i was moving when he served it would disturb him a little bit

4674216 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4674217 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries

4674247 its also about the immortality of the soul thats the main subject for us since we started to play and release albums weve always talked about the same thing the soul
4674248 this albums got a more dramatic feel to it and some of the lyrics are almost cynical
4674249 usually with my lyrics im always positive but on this album im so pissed off with the situation on earth right now how were abusing so much and we take everything that we can take from the ocean and we kill off endangered species so in some of the songs its almost like a requiem for the earth this record is a lot darker like a lot darker i would say the music is darker and more violent
4674250 i think that probably some people will be disappointed by some things we did on this album but there is also a very logical evolution of our music since from mars to sirius its pretty much what we want to hear from a band and thats been our goal since the beginning to play music we could enjoy and for the first time we are happy with the sound weve achieved by being our own producers for all these years weve never had an external person telling us what to do and for the first time were very happy with the sound because its just so powerful
4674251 we want to take advantage of the many synergies we have discovered while working side by side with cae in the cornelius arts center over the last 20 months we look forward to completing the merger and beginning this promising new chapter

4674255 we welcome two coaches who have division i playing experience professional playing experience along with coaching experience

4674281 dansen is bidden met de benen marcheren is vloeken met de voeten
4674282 maar harrie wie ben je dankbaar dan die heb ik onthouden van gerrit
4674283 er zijn mensen die zich als zij bidden met god verbonden voelen

4674289 this is a conceptual plan of the corridor mainly for the purpose of developing our relationship with our neighboring communities and with dot the state department of transportation and other authorities
4674290 we will as developers or landowners bring forward master plans especially for the three nodes at that point well begin to deal with details of the connections and the environmental impacts
4674291 this is a small area plan it has no regulatory power its really just a way of organizing our thoughts
4674292 you had a years worth of meetings you sort of developed the other page 17 in the draft document for us we all were relatively happy with it
4674293 masis had ik ook dat tmf het niet deed dus het ligt niet aan mn computer
4674294 i have never made but one prayer to god a very short one o lord make my enemies ridiculous and god granted it
4674295 gt the man who should be vice president wesley clark on cnns goofus uses the russia georgia situation to beat his chest and dust off the tired old cold war rhetoric
4674296 take classic films and remake them into short films using videotape a virtually nonexistent budget amateur actors and insane amounts of creativity
4674297 softie and scratchy are here for their 2 20 appointment with dr blahblahblah
4674298 its the diarrhea going to get worse before it gets better
4674299 what kinds of healthy foods do you like to eat
4674300 mommy dont say one two three bloop when you do that okay
4674301 see what i can do trust me and youll see
4674302 move start moving i didnt call you in here for nothing
4674303 also even if you completely obliterate the magos a new evil will take its place are you willing to continue fighting even after the enemy that caused you so much misery is destroyed
4674304 if the new evil attacks me i will start my quest anew but if that evil doesnt harm me or the people that i care for then i will observe that era
4674305 spoken like a true bear blade user thats the reason why i havent started fighting the magos they have done nothing to me so i leave them alone if it wasnt for the fact that you arent using magic like the other bear blade practitioners i would say that you were a master but being undeveloped like you are and your mindset against magic you can never be a master of the bear blade
4674306 either accept and use magic to gain the title of master or refuse it and strive to destroy the magos either way i look at it im no different then keith i need time to contemplate please excuse me master law
4674307 wolf mark dont touch anything you seem like a good guy but i dont really want to risk this house falling on my head pours tea have some tea you three it may be a while before he comes back those who practice study and use the bear blade style are normally complex on the inside when something new and big comes around they need time to soak it in and think of what they should do i wonder how many techniques that boy learned with just ki
4674308 well according to master ang he taught him all the attacks and ki techniques of the bear blade style but he never once said anything about magic
4674309 what are you still doing here you should be with ben
4674310 if youre that worried about an ally are you sure you arent in love with master ben miss ashley
4674311 will you stop calling me an old bear i may be old but im not a bear
4674312 but you use a style with the word bear in it and you are a master of that style
4674313 if i didnt know better i would say im talking to a practitioner of bear blade instead of the practitioners weapon but i do see your reason so be it i can live with old bear until young ben comes back and asks for some crash course training
4674314 crash course training why will it only be crash course
4674315 normally when a master and pupil train no one is allowed to watch but these are new times so i guess we can change tradition after all to have come so far with just ki young ben is something he could even be the reincarnation of the seventh warrior
4674316 these people need to hide from the magos or be killed by them i wonder if what im doing is right i know that there is a balance in this world not one thing is stronger then the other there is always a stronger thing in the world no one is the most powerful being for there is always a being stronger then that one and one stronger the the stronger a cycle of power if im not careful i will fall into that cycle and become tainted like keith
4674317 keith you dare to show your face to me after what you did
4674318 you talking about when i attacked the villagers that was just an example of how strong i had become i have become even more powerful then that i can easily destroy this resistance town with an earthquake but that will destroy the city up above that balance has to be secured
4674319 how dare you talk about balance you killed my family
4674320 what are you talking about i left your lovable little brother alive didnt i i made sure not to kill him maybe i should have killed you then who would have thought that you would be the one that would cause us so much trouble and where is that damn weapon of yours you are always carrying that thing around even when we were in the village
4674321 i left it behind i didnt think i would run into a traitor while i was contemplating
4674322 oh you always overthink that is your fatal flaw ben but i was ordered to do recon here not to kill i follow orders but since recon has to do with information i thought i would see what my old friend was doing here
4674323 whoa this is a weird sensation im loving this sensation yaaahaaa
4674324 looks like there is a bond that connects the blade to the young bear
4674325 what do you think of my new clothes ben fitting of a general of the magos oscuros and look at you still clinging to whats left of our pathetic village grow up and accept facts
4674326 like i will listen to a traitor like you keith
4674327 thats the man he wants to kill he looks strong
4674328 this is trouble the magos have found us here guess i have no choice but to sound the alarm
4674329 looks like my mission has been compromised nothing i can do now i was order to escape if i was found out see you around ben hope you live long enough for me to finish what i started months ago
4674330 that man hes the one you want to kill right
4674331 yes the one that killed my mother my fiancee and unborn child keith ak no he doesnt deserve that name anymore next time he and i will fight to the death one of us wont return to our comrades
4674332 so what did your meditation reveal to you young bear
4674333 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
4674334 all the prophets as many as have spoken from samuel and those after him also predicted these days
4674335 substantial majorities in nearly all nations surveyed say that if drafting a constitution for a new country they would guarantee freedom of speech
4674336 i have no idea why bill kristol would be making this statement there is no imminent endorsement
4674337 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama for whatever reason i think he has decided hes going to endorse obama
4674338 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
4674339 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
4674340 see the ones in maroon theyre the wildcats thats who we want to win
4674341 lets go over there i want to sit on the winning side
4674342 he always seems to have his hand on the ball
4674343 if you had not let the ball hit the bat first we would have advanced the runners by way of a hit batter
4674344 no way in the world he would ever expect me to throw another curve ball
4674345 ed if you want to think something why dont you think that roof back up on the barn instead of sitting in the shade all the time
4674346 dont let him get your email address or your name or your birthday worse than opening a credit card in your name youll never get away from his inane blabbering run save yourself
4674347 poems a cry from the heart of palestine in jidariyya
4674348 im going to beat him to the stage just to even things up
4674349 im going to wrestle him to the ground and get his emmy before he can
4674350 i was playing to 5 000 people at royal albert hall
4674351 we went over there this little show on bbc america up against all of the big boys the people from bbc america were saying if you win you should say this and i wasnt even listening i said im not going to win and when i got up there i forgot who to thank
4674352 it was a surreal night id done this little show that suddenly took off and im walking past tom cruise and jack nicholson and it was just ridiculous
4674353 i dont think i can compete with those big guys id hate to start thinking that people expect me to be bawdy about it just being invited is nice enough for me its an excuse to put on a suit its something i have to do once a year put on some grown up clothes
4674354 you know what an acclaimed writer i am i cant write on spec and hope to be heard if ricky gervais wants to write a speech that should be heard so if i write a speech im going to say whether i won or lost
4674355 ill tell ya what ill write one and if i lose ill do it as a podcast with you
4674356 it will be great to talk to the kids and see them play
4674357 fire eagle allowed us to easily add location data to pownce using their simple api
4674358 pownce users can now say where they are and geo tag their notes which a new dimension to the service
4674359 defensively hes been very good but hes taken some lumps at the plate
4674360 were excited to see what he can do possibly on the field
4674361 there was division in the room how wed like him more as a pitcher or as a hitter
4674362 being a college guy fife had a lot of innings under his belt
4674363 hes throwing the ball very well powering the ball down in the zone kyle weiland third round 108th overall and price didnt start in college so its more of a getting to learn process with those two guys
4674364 i think we had a good blend of high school talent mixed with college pitching able to strike guys out
4674365 thats what excites us most today is the amount of athletic kids we have and what they can do
4674366 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4674367 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4674368 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4674369 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4674370 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4674371 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4674372 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4674373 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4674374 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4674375 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4674376 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4674377 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4674378 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4674379 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4674380 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4674381 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4674382 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4674383 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4674384 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4674385 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4674386 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4674387 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4674388 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4674389 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4674390 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4674391 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4674392 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4674393 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4674394 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4674395 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4674396 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4674397 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4674398 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4674399 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4674400 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4674401 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4674402 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4674403 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4674404 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4674405 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4674406 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4674407 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4674408 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4674409 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4674410 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4674411 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4674412 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4674413 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4674414 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4674415 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4674416 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4674417 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4674418 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4674419 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4674420 jai envie de parler avec le public de ce quil a vu compris ou pas
4674421 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4674422 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4674423 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4674424 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4674425 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4674426 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4674427 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4674428 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4674429 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4674430 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4674431 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4674432 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4674433 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4674434 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4674435 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4674436 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4674437 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4674438 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4674439 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4674440 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4674441 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4674442 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4674443 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4674444 respect the other persons their items their feelings their thoughts
4674445 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayers while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend we will ever miss his love wisdom humor and the familiar comfort of his voice
4674446 isaac hayes exemplified all that is stax we are all very fortunate to have worked with a visionary who changed music in indelible and profound ways his talent was matched only by his kindness of spirit on behalf of the entire concord stax family we express our deep sympathies to his family friends and fans all over the world
4674447 the enduring influence of stax records could only have been made possible through isaacs brilliant song writing which laid the ground work for the future generations of rap hip hop and soul isaac played a pivotal role in the recent re launch of stax once again infusing the label with his creativity inspiring a whole new breed of stax artists our condolences go out to all the people whose lives isaac touched throughout his unparalleled career and lifetime
4674448 isaac had a profound and multifaceted impact on the stax label contributing to its legacy as a writer producer arranger studio musician a amp r executive and of course one its most successful artists having collaborated closely with isaac during the past few years i came to know the man behind the music and his deep love for humanity he was an extraordinary individual who used his talents to inspire and unite people from all walks of life i feel tremendously privileged to have had the opportunity to work along side this giant of a man
4674449 you know what after a year or so with my camera i am finally getting to that place that place where i can view in my head how i want a picture to turn out and then put the camera up to my eye and capture the picture just like i thought it should be sort of like you do with your knit patterns like how you think up a pattern in your head and then make it happen it makes me happy that i can do what you do and you can do what i do
4674450 jayson tried to bunt a pitch and it fouled off his bat and came up under his eye split his eye open apparently its about a two inch gash

4674455 i like to pee in the pool the pool the pool
4674456 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4674457 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4674458 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4674459 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4674460 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4674461 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4674462 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4674463 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4674464 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4674465 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4674466 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4674467 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4674468 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4674469 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4674470 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4674471 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4674472 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4674473 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4674474 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4674475 it was great to be out there practicing again and being with the guys
4674476 i was really happy to be out there bouncing around
4674477 but once a week passes you say its about time to get back in the game and start practicing with the guys
4674478 he said its hard right now its frustrating you want to be out there its your senior year brinkman said
4674479 but he said youve got to look on the bright side when was the last time you had two weeks rest when was the last time you were able to get in the weight room and work on your upper body strength and see more film and be more rested than everybody else
4674480 so there are some positive things to take from it
4674481 when youve got a young guy like terence davis out there working and youve got a healthy marshall williams and now youve got a brown who is starting to do some great things and d j boldin has had as good a fall camp so far as anybody on our football team
4674482 now what you have to be careful about is you dont get in a situation where yeah youre back youre healthy and youre ready to go but there arent enough reps to keep you happy
4674483 now at some point if we feel like our kids are not being tough minded if theyre not aggressive about trying to get back in practice and back on the field then were not going to make them do it
4674484 were just going to find somebody else to play the position
4674485 and thats where moving guys from one position to the next may come in theres not a day goes by that a coach with an injured player is not looking around the field trying to find somebody who is maybe second team or third team at another position that could be a starter for him
4674486 our guys have to be really careful because if you miss too much time you may look up and find that somebodys got your position
4674487 im sort of in that position where i dont control my own destiny
4674488 im going to stay over here and play as good as i can for the next couple of weeks and see what happens
4674489 if i would have played better golf earlier this year then id be in a much better position which is annoying but i am playing better right now
4674490 and i love them so i want to be on that team in valhalla
4674491 i thought the greens were a little slower and they were a little bumpy on the back and i just didnt have that same flow
4674492 you are going to have a lot of birdie opportunities if you hit it well
4674493 you just try to make as many putts as you can and if you are rolling it you can go low its already been proven
4674494 hes a great guy and a lot of laughs to play with
4674495 i definitely felt a lot more relaxed to get that off the shoulders was nice
4674496 weve played some golf together down in florida where we live now so it was kind of fun
4674497 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4674498 this is a planning took where all things are going
4674499 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4674500 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4674501 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4674502 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4674503 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

4674505 i really enjoyed producing and doing behind the scenes work
4674506 the baseball bears bounced back in fine fashion against osu the weather was really quirky and helped us more than it helped them we were batting when the wind kicked up to about 40 miles an hour and was swirling in all different directions fortenberry hit one that would normally have been a routine pop up to short that ended up hitting and staying fair between home plate and the mound and no one coming close to catching it the cowboy infielders were all running around trying to guage where it might come down and actually crashed into one another once seth got a double on it and gerdes scored from 2nd on the high pop up
4674507 whats neat about this is theres not a district champion in this whole deal
4674508 were district co champs cy fair was second lake was third and katy was second so were all not supposed to be here
4674509 we made some mental mistakes and our pitching was not up to some critical moments
4674510 even when we went into the final inning four runs down these guys were still determined they were going to win the ball game and they almost did we got the two runs and had the tying runs on base before that last out
4674511 do you have any information as to who was on the committee and any idea on what they considered and how they reached their conclusion

4674518 im a go back to the trailer to get some barbecued chicken you want to come with me brandon
4674519 i think its very likely at this point both sides havent been able to come to a common ground yet so unless something changes a sign and trade is probably the most probable thing
4674520 yeah i guess thats safe to say yeah it it what it is its part of the business i think one of the issues i had to deal with coming into the nba was realizing how much of a business it is
4674521 i dont know i doubt it unless something changes with the negotiations but i really dont see that happening right now
4674522 im definitely not taking that im definitely not taking it ive already expressed that to them i mean thats not an option
4674523 definitely i think last season i think i was one of the players that suffered the most on the team because at the trade deadline we brought in even more guards and i seen my minutes drop and there really was no merit for that i really dont understand why my minutes dropped this year the problem is still the same i dont see it getting better maybe somewhere else is better for my career
4674524 i was definitely trying to work something out with the bulls i told them i wanted to go back like i said it was a numbers game it wasnt about if i wanted to come back it was just a situation that was a numbers game when one option doesnt work youve got to go to plan b and plan c

4674537 it is an extremely harsh and stark environment to detain people seeking asylum while their applications for protection are determined

4674733 indias commitments under the current terms of the proposed arrangement do not justify making far reaching exceptions to international non proliferation rules and norms
4674734 unlike 178 other countries india has not signed the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt it continues to produce fissile material and expand its nuclear arsenal as one of only three states never to have signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt it has not made a legally binding commitment to achieve nuclear disarmament

4674750 t he alienation between the united states and russia has rarely if ever been deeper
4674751 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4674752 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4674753 georgia was part of russia for 200 years and what saakashvili was doing in south ossetia threatened the stability of the whole north caucasus
4674754 what worries me about this episode is the united states is jeopardizing russian cooperation on a number of issues over a dispute that at most involves limited american interests
4674755 earlier we drove to a town called senaki about 30km 20 miles east of here and it seemed the russians were very much occupying it
4674756 how long shall we stay in gori as long as we want to
4674757 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4674758 this is something that had it been about south ossetia could have been resolved within certain limits
4674759 russian peacekeepers were in the area that is true and russia initially said it needed to act to protect its peacekeepers and its people
4674760 but what russia has done is well beyond anything that anyone could say is for the protection of those people and for those peacekeepers
4674761 drove home the message by meeting with the separatist leaders of abkhazia and south ossetia
4674762 ossetians are killing poor georgians this is a problem and we are trying to deal with it
4674763 the wounded both local people and soldiers were taken to our hospital in truckloads we could barely cope there were loads of local people both dead and injured
4674764 mostly they had shrapnel wounds there were also bullet wounds though not so many
4674765 im not sure what kind of bombs were used but the shrapnel was as sharp as razor blades some shrapnel pieces were really huge i saw them penetrating concrete foundations
4674766 my minivan was stopped by men in russian peacekeeping uniforms
4674767 they threw us to the ground then put us back in the minivan and pushed more georgians into the car three men with machine guns came with us they told me to drive towards tskhinvali
4674768 the government says only 120 people have been killed but it is not true
4674769 in gori i saw lorries full of bodies being delivered to the hospital every day so many people have died why is the government lying
4674770 the russians dont realise that when russias foreign minister says something against georgia they actually make saakashvili more powerful and more popular since he was elected i have disagreed with many of saakashvilis policies but nothing that he or the georgian government could have possibly done can justify what russia is doing in my country
4674771 i blame the russians because it was them who provoked the whole thing they found some south ossetians and some abkhazians who have agreed to play their game
4674772 the russians still cannot get used to the idea that georgia is an independent state they still want to use us as their slaves
4674773 people are turning quite nationalistic and many think that the presidents decision was a justified response to ossetian shootings
4674774 it now looks like any chance there was of reconciliation is burning along with the houses
4674775 we were here four days and nights we couldnt sleep our whole building shook with the bombing
4674776 i just sat here with my 16 year old son
4674777 we were bombed for three days and nights if russia had not helped we would have disappeared
4674778 only russia takes us under its wing we want to be with russia
4674779 many ossetians i met both in tskhinvali and in the main refugee camp in russia are furious about what has happened to their city
4674780 they are very clear who they blame georgias president mikhail saakashvili who sent troops to re take control of this breakaway region
4674781 we saw no evidence to support or dispute the numbers
4674782 witness accounts and the timing of the damage would point to georgian fire accounting for much of the damage described in tskhinvali
4674783 a man of words but not of deeds is like a garden full of weeds
4674784 we need to arm the security forces with similar knowledge and technology to match the terror groups

4674803 ellos fueron gobernadores de provincias no productivas y por lo tanto no tienen ese dato incorporado

4674805 pensar que con el crecimiento era suficiente al igual que menem pens que la convertibilidad era para siempre dos errores garrafales en materia econ mica si en 2003 hubi semos empezado a trabajar con las cadenas de valor y hacer crecer las econom as regionales no los productos agropecuarios porque a esos productores no hay que ense arles nada lo que no hay que hacer es joderlos otra hubiera sido la historia
4674806 hoy estamos en dificultades hemos creado dificultades donde no las hab a que es el sector agropecuario pero en lo industrial tenemos serios problemas de competitividad por las mismas razones que ten amos en 2001 pensemos un instante si el pa s paga el 15 por ciento de inter s por la plata que consigue a cu nto la consigue una pyme o un productor al 25 o 30 por ciento y c mo puede mantener la competitividad pagando el 30 por ciento de intereses volvemos a la econom a financiera especulativa rent stica y usurera

4674812 todos somos optimistas pero quiero esperar yo lo necesito al kily bien hay que tener en cuenta que no se entren y eso no es casualidad tiene que estar sin dolor si me dice que se siente bien y que est para noventa minutos m s all de que despu s juegue lo que juegue a partir de ah me voy a sentir seguro
4674813 si el kily no llega jugar el turco zarif por la izquierda como lo hizo en el ensayo t ctico de hoy por ayer
4674814 zarif es un jugador que nos puede dar soluciones es del tipo que no abundan porque son polifuncionales le da lo mismo jugar por derecha que por izquierda no se confunde cuando le cambian la cancha lo pienso en el lugar del kily para no cambiar todo el tiempo a m ndez no lo quiero llevar a jes s a otro lado quiero un solo cambio de nombre y que t cticamente nadie tenga que cambiar de lugar salvo zarif no quiero cambiar el equipo en funci n del que ingrese
4674815 it is not so much that the church has a mission or ministries rather the church is mission
4674816 the wesleys pressed the question what is the essential calling of the church
4674817 the church of wesleys england had exchanged its true vocation mission for maintenance
4674818 baptism becomes a powerful symbol of gods presence and purpose in and for the church
4674819 the wesleys clearly understood that christianity is more caught than taught as important as preaching was of equal significance was the ministry of small groups within the methodist structure
4674820 the primary question for the methodist is not am i saved the ultimate question is for what purpose am i saved
4674821 contrary to the failure is not an option mentality failure is a necessity failure may be the first step to seeing god in a situation
4674822 to reach people no one is reaching you have to do what no one is doing but to do what no one is doing you cant do what everyone else is doing

4674825 even though i do not feel his love yet i will seek to love him as he has never been loved
4674826 i am hungry and i need to be fed at two tables the table of the word and the table of the sacrament
4674827 has been the hallmark of virtually every movement of christian renewal
4674828 the uniting of heart and head in early methodism was one of the wesleys most remarkable achievements
4674829 unite the pair so long disjoined knowledge and vital piety learning and holiness combined
4674830 the wesleys and their followers carefully balanced this form of active almost burning piety with an emphasis upon the necessity of reasoned religion
4674831 for the wesleys therefore vital piety was essentially linked with sound learning
4674832 the wesleys wanted a well informed laity who had the skills and wisdom to face the challenges of faith in the marketplace
4674833 which as i reread that it sounded like i was running around the house wearing nothing but my santa monkey underwear what i sight that would be to behold

4674921 shoaib malik enjoys the confidence and support of the selectors and he has satisfactory leadership qualities to motivate the team for producing good results
4674922 inzamam himself does not enjoy a good reputation as a captain as he made certain questionable decisions to taint the image of the country besides exhibiting his
4674923 attitude on certain occasions even at the time of selection ignoring talented misbah ul haq who was a potential threat to his middle order position
4674924 the biggest mistake made by inzamam as a captain was the forfeiting of the oval test in august 2006 which caused a lot of confusion and problems for pakistan cricket at highest level of the game then he inzamam imposed his will on selectors by including injured pacer shabbir ahmad on the tour of south africa in 2006 and even threatened to come back from the same tour
4674925 the post of the chairman pcb is a top managerial position and the present chairman is fully justifying as the head of the board and his contribution for the cause of cricket and to better the image of the country are widely acknowledged
4674926 i came to sri lanka with a lot of expectations i would like to better my previous performance i am happy with the way i have started in the rights spirit i am feeling very confident after the warm up match
4674927 the two have been bowling very well i have seen them in the test series they have been outstanding earlier murali was only one guy but now they also have mendis so we have to play outstanding cricket to deal with the situation
4674928 obviously i have to face a better attack when i play the odi but today my innings was against an international side with mendis and muralitharan sri lanka will have a potent attack
4674929 i was happy about hitting four sixes in the 45th over of mubarak of course the 6 sixes which he hit in the world cup twenty20 was playing in but it is not always possible to do it
4674930 he just took a swing and kind of felt it pop
4674931 he was hitting balls out of the ballpark right then he turned around and i seen him walking in so i said he must be feeling good hes had enough bp he still had like five minutes left but bill hall was standing right there and said russ was hurt
4674932 we found that slapp targets who fight back seldom lose in court yet are frequently devastated and depoliticized and discourage others from speaking out chilled in the parlance of first amendment commentary
4674933 oh man this is the type of loss that could derail a team
4674934 this is one the official guides to the olympics won t be handing out but it is vital to understanding the true context of the spectacle we are about to witness in beijing
4674935 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
4674936 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
4674937 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
4674938 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
4674939 you should also help another person like i helped you
4674940 when i was growing up i only wanted to do one thing and that was to play for my country i have come a long way since playing my first game which was at the mcg of all places i have had the honour of captaining my country and i just cant think of a life without cricket
4674941 a lot of people ask me for how long i will continue i say i dont know it all depends on my fitness and whether i am still good enough to play for sri lanka the day i feel i havent got it any more in me i will quit
4674942 there were a few things that i worked on after the australian series early this year it was the off season and there were no domestic competitions so i had a few sessions with the bowling machine and worked ever so harder on my physical fitness
4674943 when you are going through a bad patch its very important not to panic there are so many factors that contribute to poor form and you just need to patiently work on them and the important thing is to revert to basics
4674944 i regained my touch towards the end of the ipl and was happy to be part of the asia cup squad it was a pleasant experience to win the tournament in pakistan we hadnt won any major competition in pakistan since winning the world cup
4674945 its hard to understand they are such a strong batting side for me the best in the world without any doubt but sri lanka gave india no chance they kept the pressure on and its not easy when ajantha mendis and murali bowl in tandem i thought sri lanka had a good plan which they executed to perfection there was someone to rise to the occasion at every crucial point
4674946 but i am sure they indians will bounce back sachin is a class act rahul and sourav are quality players the point is when you are having such a long career like they have had you are bound to have a poor series it happens to all players in the world but the problem here was all three of them struggled at the same time

4674949 if mold is a problem in your home clean up the mold and get rid of the excess water or moisture fix leaky plumbing or other sources of water wash mold off hard surfaces with detergent and water and dry completely absorbent materials such as ceiling tiles and carpet that become moldy may have to be replaced
4674950 there are very few reports that toxigenic molds found inside homes can cause unique or rare health conditions such as pulmonary hemorrhage or memory loss these case reports are rare and a casual link between the presence of the toxigenic mold and these conditions have not been proven

4674955 would limit re exams to 12 to 18 months for applications that do not comport with novelty and non obviousness conditions for obtaining a patent
4674956 a patent cannot simply operate as a hunting licence to find an industrial use
4674957 r ather the patent must describe an industrial use which is specific substantial and credible
4674958 simply identifying a protein is not necessarily sufficient to confer industrial utility upon it
4674959 an astonishing range of diseases and conditions which neutrokine alpha and antibodies to neutrokine alpha may be used to diagnose and treat
4674960 t he skilled person would consider it totally far fetched that neutrokine alpha could be used in relation to all of the recited diseases and conditions and as i have found would be driven to the conclusion that the authors had no clear idea what the activities of the protein were and so included every possibility
4674961 t o have included such a range of applications was no better than to have included none at all

4674971 generic versions of the top 12 categories of biologic treatments with patent protections that have expired or that are due to expire in the near future could save americans 67 billion to 108 billion over 10 years and 236 billion to 378 billion over 20 years
4674972 allow companies to recoup their investment and conduct further clinical trials to improve the product
4674973 b ecause biosimilars arent exact duplicates of the original drugs
4674974 they dont violate the original drugs patent enabling legal distribution before patent expiration
4674975 bioequivalence testing in healthy volunteers does not provide the necessary data on how the biologic actually works in the body which can only be determined through more extensive clinical testing in patients where safety and efficacy are evaluated

4674997 we are seeing more investment in social and supportive housing than ever in the history of the city
4674998 the downtown eastside will be for many years a place you find people of low incomes
4674999 there has been an effort to keep all the social problems in one neighbourhood and i do not think that serves the people who have those problems very well
4675000 we find that when they can move outside the downtown eastside a lot of problems go away
4675001 when you start having numbers of people camping out you start moving into personal safety issues
4675002 before anyone could be harmed a solution even short term needed to be found
4675003 it was a public relations disaster to have 40 people in tents just a couple of blocks from gm place where olympics events will be happening
4675004 no one is being pushed out of any area because of the olympics
4675005 certainly you cannot handle all their addiction and mental health issues in the downtown eastside some people would do better if they were given opportunities we are not going to take them and force them to go anywhere but certainly the options have to be there for them
4675006 were certainly open to helping anyone who wants to do that
4675007 were looking at the entire province not just the downtown eastside when were looking at housing
4675008 we said you guys find the land in the communities and we are there with capital and thats what weve been doing
4675009 if we can get somebody in an environment where there are other supports around them their success rate is definitely higher than if we leave them isolated in the downtown eastside

4675011 during these humanitarian relief operations the united states expects russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open
4675012 we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4675013 the expectation was that our two nations despite our differences shared areas of common interest where we could work together as real partners
4675014 has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4675015 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4675016 weve also canceled a u s canadian russian exercise vigilant eagle that was to have begun on aug 20
4675017 in the days and weeks ahead the department of defense will reexamine the entire gamut of our military to military activities with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead

4675080 de campagne richt zich in eerste instantie tot franstalige belgen in de vlaamse rand

4675082 het uitgangspunt van dit beleid is dat vlaams brabant integraal deel uitmaakt van vlaanderen waar het nederlands de voertaal is mensen aanzetten om de nederlandse taal te leren is niet enkel belangrijk voor het nederlandstalig karakter van de vlaamse rand maar heeft ook tal van maatschappelijke gevolgen het zorgt ervoor dat anderstaligen kunnen deelnemen aan het vlaamse gemeenschapsleven gemakkelijker in contact kunnen treden met de lokale overheid en zo verhogen ook hun kansen op de arbeidsmarkt

4675104 the egyptians built an empire and ran it with a handful of technology the wheel irrigation canals the loom the calendar pen amp ink some cutting tools some simple metallurgy and the plough the invention that triggered it all off and yet look how complex and sophisticated their civilisation was and how soon it happened after that first man made harvest the egyptian plough and those of the few other civilisations sprang up around the world at the same time gave us control over nature and at the same time tied us for good to the things that we invent so that tomorrow will be better than today the egyptians knew that thats why they had gods to make sure that their systems didnt fail the great ancient temples of karnak on the edge of the nile about 450 miles south of cairo was the first great statement of what technology could do with unlimited manpower and the approval of the gods ironically the modern equivalent lies again in the desert this time the nomads also settled by a river a river of oil but what had took the pharaohs 4 000 years to build took the kuwaitis 4 000 days whats happened in kuwait the change from a nomadic existence to being able to buy and use everything modern technology has to offer has come in much less than one generation kuwait represents the immense power of technology used in a way most of us have never experienced because weve lived with the kind of change it can bring for more than a hundred years here its been focused change has been instant and total kuwait has suddenly become like new york or any other of the great urban islands on technology totally dependent on that technology like them without it kuwait would return to the desert you see how increasingly the only way we in the advanced industrial nations with our bewildering technology network can survive is by selling bewilderment and dependence on technology to the rest of the world
4675105 from a historical perspective the cultural norm placing a moral value on doing a good job because work has intrinsic value for its own sake was a relatively recent development work for much of the ancient history of the human race has been hard and degrading working hard in the absence of compulsion was not the norm for hebrew classical or medieval cultures it was not until protestant reformation that physical labor became culturally acceptable for all persons even the wealthy

4675113 i believe many coaches did not want to follow buddy and they knew that it was going to be a rebuilding year so they did not apply we have many more coaches that have applied this year and our new principal was a head basketball coach
4675114 i am not allowed to give out names but we had 81 applicants and 60 of those being head coaches
4675115 we hired chris ronmine from georgetown he is a up and rising star and endoresed by bill farney director of uil
4675116 your lack of detail is very frustrating i have not seen it in the galveston website and if it is in the houston paper it is buried by all the other things
4675117 i am not sure where it is in the paper or which day it was in i am sorry for the lack of details this young man was part of the program that was turned around in georgetown and the second half of this year he took some very untalented kids and upset everyone in the area district and beat the 9 team in the state of texas he is very energetic positve and will bring class to the program if you remember buddy carlisle was a young and rising star and was given an opportunity to take charge of a great program i hope this gives you the information you are looking for have a great day
4675118 i need to quit bothering you but i do wonder how long he has coached where and especially what his record is im sure he has many fine qualities and i certainly wish him well
4675119 his overall record at georgetown this year was not reflective of the final results of the season he and the coach before him turned that program around he has coached for 10 years when the committee was finished interviewing we all had a great feeling for this young man our committee was composed of all the athletic leaders the principal mr bocart principal was a head basketball i do not have his information in front of me but mr bochart has all of that information i know that your loyality is for creek but our district is huge and has had a banner year in athletics if you are ever in the area come by and i will show you around our facilities i think you will be proud of the progress next year ccisd will have 80 varsity teams competing have a wonderful day
4675120 in looking back at coach romines resume his record is not listed he was head coach at georgetown since 2003 before that he was the assistant coach at south houston high school i believe he will be an outstanding addition to clear creek high school and i am looking forward to him taking over the basketball program

4675124 weve got a brazilian coach so that helps and we know what annoys him so were pretty sure we know what annoys them as well
4675125 nats pretty good at doing sneaky sledges because youre not allowed to sledge
4675126 some of them dont understand english so you can say what you like
4675127 but tamsins got some extra height so she just puffs her chest out and they all get intimidated just a little bit of sand in the eye
4675128 it really did feel like war high pressure and point for point and tamsin at the net was blocking amazing and im throwing around sand everywhere and it was hot and steamy just very very high pressure but we came out on top
4675129 were playing great and if we keep playing to our form then that a gold medal is a really high possibility

4675131 the purpose driven pastor rick warren americas most powerful religious leader takes on the world
4675132 is he oversubscribed i ask him how many countries there are in the world of course he knows theres 195 countries i think 195 countries and so far even one seems to be a challenge referring to rwanda
4675133 whenever salvation has been administered it has been by testimony
4675134 one truth revealed from heaven is worth all the sectarian notions in existence
4675135 the church of jesus christ of latter day saints was founded upon direct revelation
4675136 the grand rule of heaven is that nothign should ever be done on earth without revealing the secret to his servants the prophets agreeable to amos 3 7
4675137 the presidents or first presidency are over the church and revelations of the mind and will of god to the church are to come through the presidency this is the order of heaven and the power and privilege of the melchizedek priesthood
4675138 it is contrary to the economy of god for any member of the church or any one to receive instructions for those in authority higher than themselves
4675139 entirely at variance with the order of gods house as laid down in the new testament as well as in our late revelations
4675140 the keys of the mysteries and the revelations which are sealed
4675141 there is the written word of god to us concerning the work of god from the beginning of the world almost to our day and now when compared with the living oracles those books are nothing to me
4675142 we dont need to study the scriptures seriously because we have general conference every six months
4675143 if the brethren arent saying it it doesnt matter whether it can be found in the scriptures it is either irrelevant for now or simply not true
4675144 joseph smith said if god has appointed him and chosen him as an instrument to lead the church why not let him lead it through does god not reveal things differently from what we expect
4675145 we trust that you desire counsel from time to time and that you will cheerfully conform to it whenever you receive it from a proper source
4675146 but they could not endure the new revelation the old we believe because our fathers did but away with new revelations
4675147 it was too much it showed the corruptions of that generation
4675148 cherished honored and supported knaves vagabonds hypocrties impostors and the basest of men
4675149 seal up the door of heaven by saying so far god may reveal and i will believe
4675150 when we decided to virtualize our data center acronis true image proved to be the perfect complement for backup and recovery
4675151 other products we tested did not have the ability to capture the hardware image virtualize it and then restore it to dissimilar hardware it is a complex job that acronis does well
4675152 we discussed going virtual early in the development phases as it gave multiplied media the flexibility it needed to support developers and engineers world wide
4675153 the acronis product was the best choice to take multiplied medias microsoft virtual server development environments and turn them into standardized physical production servers acronis true image enterprise servers ease of use and reliability has been proven time and again its a staple in my virtualization toolbox
4675154 acronis true image had all the features multiplied media required to keep its business up and running and to handle all of its migration needs
4675155 businesses of all sizes need to have a proactive plan to ensure information is protected and can be quickly recovered in the wake of an unforeseen system crash or other disaster regardless of whether the hardware involved is physical or virtual

4675157 we are very excited to have ray join our program
4675158 he is a very versatile guard and will be a great benefit to our program
4675159 ray was most valuable player in the district his senior year
4675160 during rays junior year he won the 3 point shooting contest at the toyota center in his senior year he and a team mate were chosen to participate again his team mate won first and kraemer won second the team received about 11 000 00 for that performance
4675161 we will be talking about this process next week we hope to have someone on board soon so they can meet the staff and start working with the kids
4675162 we hired chris romine from georgetown he is a up and rising star and endorsed by bill farney director of uil
4675163 his overall record at georgetown this year was not reflective of the final results of the season he and the coach before him turned that program around he has coached for 10 years when the committee was finished interviewing we all had a great feeling for this young man
4675164 i showed up at 12 30 with a big crew of my buds from penland
4675165 overall it was just an awesome night it just had a great collegiate feel about it something that we dont get too often at bu i cannot wait for saturday
4675166 i have a friend who coaches high school basketball and he told me its much harder to get a team ready to play after an exhausting emotional win than after an exhausting emotional loss because the latter maintains something of a chip on its shoulder and in some cases with more desperation

4675179 as i was driving i suddenly remembered thjat i had seen something in the newspaper about another tournament being played at clear creek high school i have no idea what made me remember that tournament and likewise i have no idea what possessed me to stop there
4675180 i guess i figured i should drop by clear creek to let the coach dub kelly know that professional baseball people appreciated his efforts in staging the tournament
4675181 as i settled into my seat the alvin coach was making a pitching change and up to the mound walked a gangly awkward looking six foot kid who could not have weighed mlre than 150 pounds
4675182 the young pitcher wound up and fired i could not believe what i had just seen his one pitch sent my mind spinning my pulse racing that fast ball of his was unbelievable it was the fastest id ever seen anywhere major leagues minor leagues anywhere
4675183 as far as being a pure shooter paul trcka was definitely one i was first hand and bennie lenox would have to rank up there too i have had a number of good shooters who didnt necessarily have great stats but just had good shots all of them had loose wrists and great backspin on their shots
4675184 we have talked about pure shooters but i would like to bring up about good shooting gyms autry court home of the rice owls was my kind of a good shooting gym i felt very comfortable in this gym i will never forget the giant curtain at the south end i had my career high 31 points at sam vs rice in the victory
4675185 i know its going to be special for him to come back home and get to coach on the field he used to play at
4675186 kind of a dubious honor isnt it to be his 500th win
4675187 he demanded excellence at all times and i dont think that his expectations are too high
4675188 hes the last of the old school hardnosed coaches hes one of the last of that breed that i know but hes produced results year in and year out and thats to be commended
4675189 i guess you can say when youve been given an opportunity to stay in a profession at a good place with good kids that certain mark will eventually come and today happened to be it
4675190 we talk about the journeys we go through this season
4675191 we start with a pretty big margin but as you get closer to district that margin of error gets smaller you just dont make mental mistakes like that hopefully he learned a lesson
4675192 no 4 on the list two years ago white is running out of time as the yankees acquire more and more pitchers with similar or better stuff and more command hes still a factor though and hes taken to minor league pitching coordinator nardi contreras instruction and improved his curveball at his best white pounds the strike zone with a 90 93 mph four seam fastball that he occasionally throws at 95 as well as his curveball and two versions of a changeup one of his changes is straight while the other has some sink his whole package was more effective when he repeated double a last year particularly against lefthanders in triple a white got pounded when he elevated both his fastball and his changeups hes worked hard to pick up a two seam fastball and to improve his command the yankees are suddenly crowded with triple a righthanders and white has little relief pitching in his past so he could need time to adjust if asked to change roles his ceiling is more likely at the back of the rotation but he has more stuff than the likes of jeff karstens and darrell rasner to pass them white likely will have to master triple a in 2007
4675193 mccormick has been a top prospect since high school in his first full pro season he earned a promotion after 11 starts in low class a but pitched just four more innings because of shoulder inflammation mccormick consistently brings power stuff to the mound he was blowing mid to upper 90s fastballs as a prep phenom and continues to throw in that range as a starter when hes mechanically sound his hard curveball is one of the best breaking pitches in the system despite his electric stuff mccormick never has consistently dominated opponents he walks too many hitters and runs up high pitch counts hes still trying to find a comfortable grip for a changeup the cardinals will use him as a starter in high class a this year but he long has been considered a possible closer candidate in that role he could flourish with just two pitches
4675194 its kind of a crapshoot but as soon as you can find a role for a kid the better off youre going to be
4675195 we thought tommy blake could have been a better than average tailback but hes a great defensive end jason phillips has the body type to be a fullback but linebackers play a lot more in our system we knew he had great intangibles because hes a coachs son with football smarts and good reactions

4675206 phillips flew up the depth chart to lead the horned frogs in tackles as a freshman he came to tcu as a lightning fast tailback before bulking up to 240 pounds and using his speed to become a big hitter with great range in the middle itll be a shock if he doesnt earn all mountain west honors
4675207 in terms of upside the most promising pitcher in the group is mccormick he has thrown in the mid 90s since high school and his curveball can be a plus pitch at times but hes inconsistent with the quality of his secondary pitches his command and his ability to compete mccormick also battled shoulder problems this season and i dont have much faith that hes going to reach his ceiling

4675216 the government is responsible for all school going children in the care of its agents such as teachers school authorities and any other person in its employment during the time the schools are in session
4675217 perpetrator psychological rehabilitation is an extremely important prevention strategy for example a sexual aggressor who begins abusing during adolescence and is not rehabilitated is estimated to commit an average of 380 sexual offences during his lifetime
4675218 sexual assault can be verbal visual or anything that forces a person to join in unwanted sexual contact or attention
4675219 girls reported routine sexual harassment by teachers as well as psychological coercion to engage in
4675220 my friends were bullying me and telling me that i was just making up this whole thing that i just wanted to put the teacher in trouble many days i would go home crying
4675221 girls are especially vulnerable to abuse and that they require special protection
4675222 empowering girls is the foundation for enabling them to be less vulnerable to abuse of any kind a key element of our programme policy is that girls develop the confidence to reduce their exposure to abusive situations
4675223 i couldnt believe it i didnt know what to do the first thing that came to my mind was to confront the teacher at school
4675224 sexual abuse and exploitation in school environments was all too frequent some of the perpetrators were teachers who prey on vulnerable girls exchanging answers to tests or higher grades for sex most abuses by teachers are not reported and few teachers are penalized a more typical outcome is that the teacher is cautioned and possibly transferred in some cases parents negotiate for the teacher to marry the girl advocates for girls education have tried to get stiffer penalties against teachers who abuse students and to ensure that those found responsible are dismissed however the onus is on the girls parents not the school to report the case to the police so criminal charges can be made school administrators sometimes interfere with the process by transferring the teachers elsewhere which makes it extremely difficult for the case to proceed
4675225 suffering in silence the links between human rights abuses and hiv transmission to girls in zambia
4675226 a teacher has moral superiority over his pupils a girl saying that she loved a teacher does not mean that she consented to sex when she is below 16 years of age this teacher manipulated the girl by deliberately forgetting her past examination papers in order to create an opportunity to sexually abuse her at his home there can be no consent by a child under 16 years of age to characterize a childs valentine card as consenting is legally morally and psychologically flawed such a person who interprets a young girl this way undermines section 138 of the zambian penal code it is contrary to the ethics of a teacher to sleep with school girls it is psychologically wrong a child under 16 is not cognitively developed enough to consent to sex when children are left at school a teacher becomes a parent the standard of care managed by a headmaster of a school is one of a careful father toward his own children the chances of millions of girls being infected with a hiv aids death sentence by unscrupulous teachers and or headmasters cannot go unabated diseases in zambia such as hiv aids have no cure
4675227 world report on violence and health chap 6 sexual violence
4675228 action in schools is vital for reducing sexual and other forms of violence in many countries a sexual relation between a teacher and a pupil is not a serious disciplinary offence and policies on sexual harassment in schools either do not exist or are not implemented in recent years though some countries have introduced laws prohibiting sexual relations between teachers and pupils such measures are important in helping eradicate sexual harassment in schools at the same time a wider range of actions is also needed including changes to teacher training and recruitment and reforms of curricula so as to transform gender relations in schools
4675229 i want to ensure that such a situation does not happen to any child because the emotional scars do not heal
4675230 i feel like a hero for coming out in the open because most girls tend to keep quite when such things happen to them
4675231 i want to urge young girls not to trust any strangers and to report any cases of sexual abuse against them
4675232 we zambians especially activists must translate this landmark judgment with clear illustrations cartoons and posters into simple english and the seven official local languages of zambia so that every person who can read or see learns from it
4675233 because now i am a role model some girls even come to me for advice like the girl from school who came and told me that her uncle had defiled her and asked me what she should do i advised her to tell a family member or see her pastor at church right away
4675234 this judgment also protects the girl child from the sexual abuse that customarily follows enforced child marriages
4675235 womens ngos now have a precedent which they can use to lobby for legal and policy reform
4675236 errant staff suspensions inside the schools is not enough more in depth measures have to be taken especially preventative ones
4675237 i also tell my friends not to trust any strangers that they should speak out when something of that sort happens
4675238 we value education and as such will not take kindly to any girl being stripped of her right to education and a secured bright future
4675239 the teaching profession is a noble one and all bad eggs must be removed from the education sector and exposed the message we are sending is a zero tolerance one
4675240 we have to fight this scourge together because a potential defiler can be anywhere at school or at home

4675279 only the russians are at present developing ways to ship both oil and gas from arctic offshore platforms
4675280 but surely the major north american companies must now be looking at the possibility of using a similar system
4675281 if those companies do opt for this it will be important to know where the terminals will be if they are built on the u s alaskan side of the arctic canada can expect the sovereignty crisis of 1969 and 1970 to be renewed
4675282 there have been no changes in either the american or canadian position about the passage of tankers through the northwest passage
4675283 our ability to assert control in our northern waters is limited
4675284 more troubling is that the government has failed to develop a comprehensive policy framework to control the arctic effectively
4675285 the martin government had begun such an effort the northern strategy with a section that was to provide a much stronger policy framework to assert canadian control over our arctic waters its defeat derailed that effort
4675286 the harper government has promised to continue this work but has not publicly released any version of its strategy
4675287 time is running out if we do not have a clear policy framework for all shipping in the arctic it will be too late to do so after the new shipping arrives
4675288 the melting ice in the northwest passage is going to result in more international shipping in the arctic canada needs to be prepared for when it comes or else the world will simply ignore canada

4675318 in this article the authors argue that the overwhelming portion of the literature on intelligence race and genetics is based on folk taxonomies rather than scientific analysis they suggest that because theorists of intelligence disagree as to what it is any consideration of its relationships to other constructs must be tentative at best they further argue that race is a social construction with no scientific definition thus studies of the relationship between race and other constructs may serve social ends but cannot serve scientific ends no gene has yet been conclusively linked to intelligence so attempts to provide a compelling genetic link of race to intelligence are not feasible at this time the authors also show that heritability a behaviorgenetic concept is inadequate in regard to providing such a link

4675329 both the mccain and obama energy plans privilege corporate profits over the urgent need to transforms our nations energy policies both mr mccain and mr obama are seeking ways to preserve corporate profits at a time when the future of our planet is at stake
4675330 barack obamas support for nuclear power and ethanol and his recent turnaround on offshore drilling prove that he like john mccain will not challenge the power and profits of the energy industry we need the kind of national leadership on energy and the global warming threat thats represented by our presidential and congressional green candidates
4675331 drilling in anwr would have little discernible impact on actual global oil supplies as its advocates well know the argument that it could nonetheless bring down oil prices is based not on hard economics but on market psychoanalysis drilling would send a message to the oil traders that more oil is on the way which would cause them to start betting down the price
4675332 americas first energy priorities must be conservation and efficiency the green party has an effective plan to reorganize the economy create millions of new jobs in conversion to safe clean energy conservation and expansion of public transportation to replace car traffic
4675333 such an effort should be comparable to americas concerted and internationally cooperative effort to defeat the axis powers during world war ii but this time wed be uniting for peace since global warming threatens the security of the entire world in the coming decades
4675334 without such an effort the disaster we witnessed in new orleans during and after katrina will take place on a global scale billions of people will see their homes livelihoods health and lives threatened while corporate interests exploit the devastation for more money and power

4675339 were in danger of seeing the 2008 election stolen again as in 2000 and 2004
4675340 in florida in 2000 and ohio in 2004 we witnessed the obstruction and manipulation of votes by election officials and possible tampering with computer voting machines but equally insidious is the malapportionment of electoral college votes which disenfranchises whole sections of the voting public
4675341 the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president and vice president of the united states is denied or in any way abridged
4675342 if two thirds of the voters in a state vote for a candidate from party a and one third vote for a candidate from party b and the states winner take all rule gives all of the states electors to party a then one third of the voters have been disenfranchised in violation of amendment 14 section 2 of the us constitution
4675343 weve witnessed in election after election how some states have used the winner take all formula to prevent the votes of political ethnic and other minorities from being counted
4675344 alter the fate of the 2008 presidential election in a manner different from any presidential election in the nations history
4675345 by refusing to challenge electoral college malapportionment in 2000 and 2004 which blocked democratic electors from voting in those elections the democratic partys leaders abandoned tens of thousands of their own voters just as they failed to challenge the election irregularities in florida and ohio in 2000 and 2004
4675346 will they fail to challenge malapportionment again in 2008 and hand the republicans another victory barack obama would not be the democratic nominee if not for the democratic partys proportional assignment of primary delegates the winner take all provisions in the general election present the distinct possibility that mr obama in 2008 will win the popular vote by a considerably larger margin than did gore in 2000 but will repeat the democratic loss in the electoral college
4675347 if proportional assignment is considered by democrats to be vital to democracy in their primary elections why wont they fight for it in the general election
4675348 the democratize the electoral college program exposes the hypocrisy and fraud behind charges that the mckinney campaign might spoil the democratic presidential tickets chances of winning democratic leaders should have to explain why they choose to ignore 13 additional electors from southern states that theyd gain through the green partys presidential electors project why is the green party fighting to give voice to democratic voters that the democratic party will not fight for let me be clear were not doing this to assist barack obama but to foster real democracy and voter participation and to offer cynthia mckinney as the truly democratic choice for all the people
4675349 americans dont vote for president instead we vote for an electoral college which was created in the late 1700s to expressly increase the power of the slave states and which it is still doing
4675350 the electors in these southern states arkansas 6 electoral votes georgia 15 electoral votes louisiana 9 electoral votes tennessee 11 electoral votes texas 34 electoral votes are not bound by state law to cast their vote for a specific candidate

4675356 millions of voters plan to vote for barack obama in the hope that hell bring peace to iraq and other nations in the region
4675357 but his positions are really mccain lite hell continue many of the same belligerent foreign policies as the bush cheney administration that john mccain would mr obama supports a larger military in terms of both spending and personnel we want to stop the us from being the worlds bully and instead fund a peace dividend to deal with the economic energy and global warming crises
4675358 we appeal to voters to take a look at the green partys peace slate of candidates with cynthia mckinney and rosa clemente on the green presidential ticket a vote for a candidate who doesnt represent your own ideals is a vote wasted
4675359 many obama supporters dont realize that the differences between mr obama and mr mccain on foreign policy are actually quite narrow and based on the same assumptions both believe that the us has a right to occupy other countries place political demands on their leaders and take control of their resources but other voices are getting frozen out of the debate including the green nominees for the white house and congress whose campaigns are building americas permanent peace party alternative

4675364 only a tiny number of signatures on the nader petitions 687 or 1 3 percent of the total were counted as forgeries by their signers and in the words of pennsylvania supreme court justice thomas saylor there is no evidence to support democrats claims that the nader campaign was even aware of such signatures furthermore no allegation of fraud was ever raised against romanellis petitions there is however evidence that the nader petitions were the target of widespread and deliberate sabotage specifically petition circulators discovered and removed about 7 000 obviously fake signatures prior to submitting the petitions
4675365 we support carl romanellis request for the court to drop the 80 000 legal fee costs that were imposed on him the assessment of these costs is unprecedented and meant to intimidate non democrat and non republican candidates from running for office
4675366 the leveling of punitive and exorbitant costs for disqualified signatures is as outrageous as pennsylvanias ballot access rule that requires 2 000 valid signatures from democratic or republican candidates for president and other top offices while requiring as many as 67 000 signatures for candidates from other parties or independents to get on the ballot
4675367 lift the stay in the case and proceed with targeted discovery in order to help protect the integrity of the 2008 election
4675368 voters deserve to see the candidates they support on the ballot and deserve to know that the votes they cast will be counted unless the full weight of the law comes down on those who try to manipulate elections and until we repeal ballot access rules designed to rig the vote in favor or one or two political parties were in danger of seeing more damaged and stolen elections

4675510 this is the one time every four years where swimming really gets a lot of exposure
4675511 people who have no knowledge or interest in swimming get caught up in it ive seen it at work co workers know of my involvement in swimming and they ask me about it
4675512 were having a clinic right now and the kids are coming in in the morning and theyre talking about staying up late and watching the events the night before
4675513 the rest of the time swimming is not so much of a spectator sport but its not televised either its hard to find a lot of times kids find swimming on the internet and they come in and tell others they saw someone break a world record
4675514 and it gets them excited about getting back into the pool
4675515 were televising them whenever theyre on all day and late into the night
4675516 the customers definitely want it on people ask for it gymnastics and swimming have been the biggest so far the main gold medal events we put on the big screen
4675517 i prefer the summer olympics because you get a good mix of events swimmings been the highlight this year but its all fun its part of the whole get behind america again michael phelps is doing great and its nice to be part of it
4675518 would i go out of my way to watch swimming any other time of the year no unless it was the swedish bikini team aside from that im not going to watch swimming except in the olympics

4675533 successful aging is a lot of the time defined in terms of cognitive or physical functioning and its usually inevitable that those things will decline but this shows that the really key components of successful aging may be how happy you are and how satisfied you are with your life and these factors dont tend to decline with age
4675534 intelligence is a really highly valued resource in our society and is closely linked with our life satisfaction
4675535 but when we get older and leave the workforce other things may take on more value such as our emotional ties and bonds with friends

4675543 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

4675555 there is always great expectation for liverpool in the league so we need to start well and keep improving
4675556 we must concentrate every day and pay attention to details because weve done well most of the time against the top teams but lost too many points against the others but i think robbie keane can make a difference for us
4675557 are we ready to kill someone to win a game no because you have to respect the rules in football

4675571 john mccain receives nearly 24 000 each year in social security
4675572 as president i will protect social security for todays seniors and future generations
4675573 that means strengthening social securitys solvency while protecting middle class families from benefit cuts tax increases or increases in the retirement age
4675574 it means treating social security not as a political football or describing it as an absolute disgrace but instead honoring it as the cornerstone of the social compact in this country

4675597 how is an aging baby boomer generation changing the design of homes
4675598 whats being called the russian blitz of the nation of georgia former soviet republic that split away and is now threatening to split apart from within
4675599 the powerful russian war machine is moving ever deeper into georgia and teaching all of us really a lesson about what makes russia tick
4675600 it started as a gamble by georgia the former soviet republic and darling of the west move quickly into the breakaway pro russian enclave called south ossetia and take back what is legally georgias but the plan failed instead russian forces invaded georgia last week and crushed georgian resistance according to u s military officials russia is out to decimate the u s trained georgian armed forces
4675601 but after hundreds perhaps thousands killed and tens of thousands displaced tonight georgians are asking when will the russian bear stop
4675602 so how did this fighting start and what is it really all about
4675603 whats troubling about this war fought in a relatively unknown region is that none of the suffering here is about the enclave of ossetia this war is all about russia and the message russia is sending to the world
4675604 russia has itched to strike at southern neighbor georgias brash western oriented leader president mikheil saakashvili and saakashvili gave the kremlin an opportunity when he sent troops into the separatist region of south ossetia last week in an effort to reassert georgias sovereignty
4675605 the most urgent need is to see clearly what is taking place as the crisis deepened one could hear in washington the usual attempts to blame the victim as if georgia somehow deserved this fate because its elected government had opted for friendly relations with the west
4675606 russia as my grandmother could have told george w bush always fights dirty
4675607 russias aggression is really about the subordination of georgia a democratic market oriented u s ally
4675608 in iraq we and our iraqi allies are on the verge of a strategic victory over the jihadists
4675609 russia has sent troops and tanks across an international border
4675610 we owe georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty

4675614 stop telling me to avoid ankle strap shoes and tell me something i dont know
4675615 if anyone would have said before the games that id win two golds and break the world record id have laughed in their face i never thought it
4675616 i knew when i touched the wall i was going to win the gold but i didnt expect to get the record and by that much its unbelievable
4675617 its always been a goal of mine to do this i never really expected i could do it at this moment in time but its always been in the back of my mind
4675618 its the olympic games everyone raises the bar i cant believe what happened im so happy it wasnt like the 400 i knew id won

4675620 four occupants were at home and they were underage they made it out of the house after the fire started
4675621 not only did he direct us in and help us cause of it had a little bit of smoke showing but he did corral the kids and keep them in a safe place
4675622 we had a real fast response because we were all on the road in kailua so we got here fire damage was limited to the bedroom because we all arrived real quick it was fast fast work
4675623 thats something that i am going to have to sit down with my young son and talk to him about that cause we are always talking about there is no need to be playing with fire or matches
4675624 i believe that when children are left alone like this they should be educated and reminded of all homes safety and that would include fire safety
4675625 i think that maybe its a lesson maybe a hard lesson that hes going to learn because i am sure we lost somethings but like i said we are just happy that everythings alright
4675626 it didnt take them long to get right into the swing of things
4675627 hes getting a cheeseburger hes seeing a movie he seemed pretty relaxed and i was happy that hawaii is the place he comes to be himself

4675692 you want to have that confidence that you can stop the run i think this weekend well do a better job of that especially with our younger guys

4675735 its not an if hes got to be executing making good quality pitches feeling good about his breaking ball and feeling comfortable physically
4675736 richies moved back there and played well for the most part at right guard he had a really good week this last week there
4675737 its the best five to have brett in the lineup and me at the same time so they moved me to right guard
4675738 and thats fine by me im glad that we did it this early in the preseason as opposed to waiting till week 1 or week 2 of the regular season and then have to bounce over and not have much work there
4675739 now ive got a couple of preseason games to work with and a lot of practice time so im really comfortable
4675740 years past we cant control whats been done we can control what we do tonight hopefully put some points on the board

4675751 but hes really doing well hes tough hes 232 pounds but doesnt look 232 hes a physical player and hes smart and mature so its a real plus for us
4675752 i think there was a higher level of optimism right away
4675753 you dont want to rush something and have him have a problem again
4675754 hes not going to be able to do something serious about throwing until tuesday
4675755 theres no way youre going to put him in a game before a week from then so thats two weeks at the soonest theres no reason not to use that spot for something like a player
4675756 the good news is it isnt something that hes had surgically repaired the one concern is its with his pitching arm youre always careful but i dont know what to expect except we know were going to do our best for him
4675757 just knock the expletive out of it dont hold anything back just spin as fast as you can break your fingers off and see where it lands

4675769 you know this sports brutal sometimes its so easy and sometimes it feels like the balls 100 pounds

4675771 for him to come here and win a silver medal in the fashion that he did is an awesome accomplishment he may be disappointed with the distance im sure he will be
4675772 but ultimately hes a silver medalist in the olympic games and thats a pretty special thing

4675962 the right word may be effective but no word was ever as effective as a rightly timed pause
4675963 jesus came to destroy the evil hierarchy that exists in our world the bible says that he resists and distances himself from the proud but he gives grace to the humble he draws near to and confides in those who love and fear him he confronts those who are impressed only with themselves
4675964 consequently the banners of title and position are not the solutions for someone burdened by labels accumulated from past hurts they are merely substitutes for the true identity that jesus offers covering up insecurities with accomplishments never turns lies into truths
4675965 whats wonderful is that jesus came to take off the demeaning dunce caps that have been piled on our heads he gladly peels off the scarlet letters that have been pinned all over us whatever we have been through whatever we have done whatever others say about us jesus can forgive it heal it rebuild it and redeem it he makes all things new
4675966 covering up insecurities with accomplishments never turns lies into truths

4675976 i had only ever been to one strip club before i went to new orleans to do that movie
4675977 yeah heck yes but then i thought well this is real research ive got to do this for the role man ive got to do this but yeah it was terrifying especially when i get there this guy was a doctor apparently he was an older man and they whip out the cocaine and they start doing cocaine on the desk and im like am i incriminating myself i mean i didnt do any of the cocaine okay i just went there to observe so that was scary it was in a nice hotel the guy who took us over had a key to the room so he just opened up and the doctor is just lying in the bed and he wasnt completely naked when we got in there but he certainly got naked
4675978 later franco would tell cage about all this and it would become the inspiration for when cages character in the movie a pimp called acid yellow snorts a line and then declares
4675979 it was it was mixed because on one hand it was scary strange to be there you know ive done bad things and i have been arrested but i have never been in that situation so i was feeling all that but then on the other hand it is just like a human interaction so theres none of the movie music going on to heighten the situation and so it had this strange you know casualness to it just people having sex or about to have sex and there i am standing in the room you know and so that was weird

4676172 the leap of faith is really a very ordinary operation we take it every time we fall in love expect kindness from someone impulsively sacrifice some little piece of our self interest after all you cannot prove the existence of truth beauty goodness and decency you cannot prove the dignity of being human or your obligation to treat people as ends and not just as means you take a gamble on the existence of these inestimable things for that reason when you lay scientific logical and empirical siege to the leap of faith at the core of the religious impulse you are not just attacking faith in god you are attacking the act of faith itself faith in anything that cant be proved but it just so happens that the qualities that make life rich joyful and humane cannot be proved
4676173 every truth is a tool in the hands of those in power

4676185 we had an aphid problem like you cant believe it was like a fuzzy angora of aphids

4676187 the market for computer games grew once more as compared to 2007 even though there were no new games consoles launched onto markets what we see is structural growth which is also due to new groups of purchasers
4676188 the market for computer games has reached quite an impressing size in germany it nowadays is at least as important as other branches of the entertainment business such as the film or music industry but there is one difference to it the games market is growing rapidly

4676225 a particularly important class of chorales were the contrafacta or parodies of secular songs in which the given melody was retained but the text was either replaced by completely new words or else were altered so as to give it a properly spiritual meaning the adaptation of secular songs and secular polyphonic compositions for church purposes was common in the sixteenth century

4676234 well be sent to the spice mines of kessel smashed into who knows what
4676235 youre both wrong hes a good hindu boy i see him all the time at the temple coming for darshan and performing puja
4676236 i know this boy he is piscine molitor patel and hes a christian
4676237 i know him too and i tell you hes a muslim
4676238 piscine was born a hindu lives a hindu and will die a hindu
4676239 you dont have a single miracle to show for it what kind of religion is that without miracles
4676240 it isnt a circus with dead people jumping out of tombs all the time thats what we muslims stick to the essential miracle of existence birds flying rain falling crops growing these are miracles enough for us
4676241 feathers and rain are all very nice but we like to know that god is truly with us
4676242 is that so well a whole lot of good it did god to be with you you tried to kill him you banged him to a cross with great big nails is that a civilized way to treat a prophet the prophet muhammad peace be upon him brought us the word of god without any undignified nonsense and died at a ripe old age
4676243 the word of god to that illiterate merchant of yours in the middle of the desert those were drooling epileptic fits brought on by the swaying of his camel not divine revelation that or the sun frying his brains
4676244 if the prophet p b u h were alive he would have choice words for you
4676245 well hes not christ is alive while your old p b u h is dead dead dead
4676246 the real question is why is piscine dallying with these foreign religions
4676247 and with their god muslims are always causing troubles and provoking riots the proof of how bad islam is is how uncivilized muslims are
4676248 while christians kneel before a white man they are the flunkies of foreign god they are the nightmare of all non white people
4676249 is whether piscine wants real religion or myths from a cartoon strip
4676250 i would like to remind you there is freedom of practice in this country
4676251 mr patel piscines piety is admirable in these troubled times its good to see a boy so keen on god we all agree on that
4676252 but he cant be a hindu a christian and a muslim its impossible he must choose
4676253 i dont think its a crime but i suppose youre right
4676254 bapu gandhi said all religions are true i just want to love god

4676272 i was having one of those awful dreams where im back at school i hate those i always seem to be missing something like schoolbooks shoes or rubber plant anyway i was in a history lesson that was all about great explorers i used to like them by the way maybe thats why i dreamt about it

4676274 assistance required assistance required this unit is under attack this unit is under attack i am blind where once there was light now there is only darkness ayuda ayuda help help
4676275 what the one where i just came barging in and shouted a lot
4676276 i was proceeding in a westerly direction in section twenty two bee corridor five level seventeen when i was assaulted by a huge gang of dust particles they blinded me and made me collide with the wall on several occasions i think i dented my battery flap and theres vicious scrape all along my left flank go faster stripe which is bound to peel off 34 unless someone sticks it back down for me then i came here
4676277 i dont suppose theres any chance of breakfast im starving to death here
4676278 oh im sorry this doesnt visually best represent the hamster emotion called excitement
4676279 but i did 35 see a pair of visiting jerboas do it once when they discovered that theyd missed the last train to mollusk and all they had between them was a moldy old kite and a pair of soiled plimsols
4676280 i think i might have the answer to the mystery
4676281 but its down in the artifact store i hope you dont mind
4676282 how many times do i have to tell you colin
4676283 not to go near the artifact store you know there might be something in there so horrendously horrifically nauseatingly dangerous that it could end all life everywhere for ever and a day whyd ya take chances like that lad
4676284 why is it dangerous can i see it i think that it would be splendid if someone would give me a tour despite the dangers real or imagined i mean is this a possibility or not hmmm
4676285 oh well im not entirely certain i should be telling you anything about it what with boney blowing his top and all that
4676286 that i think ive found a way of seeing how all this dust gets here
4676287 well i mean dust doesnt just arrive spontaneously does it it means that something must have put it there it must be propagated
4676288 and if im right about one of those doo dads down in the artifact store i think we can find out what this propagator was
4676289 i wouldnt want to upset boney any further rodents and stressful situations dont mix well together at all my olfactory sensor shut down routine has to work overtime
4676290 thank the great angler herself for that wise summation im sorry about your nose too
4676291 no well just not trouble poor old boney with the truth
4676292 oh are you sure thats the wisest course of action available to you
4676293 theres a charming bowl just inside the artifact store on the left
4676294 and i dont keep it in my back pocket if you catch my drift
4676295 where is a gangling young male hamster when you most need one
4676296 i bet my darling lionels geeking it up in the artifact store with colin guess id better save him from himself
4676297 that sure beats the heck out of 41 condensation or fluids that leech out of the concrete ceiling often forming calcium stalactites or is it stalagmites ive never been certain which one sticks up and which one hangs down
4676298 by the saint of all hamsters cant a male hamster take a leak in private anymore
4676299 ive found it straight away it was almost as though it was calling to me with an inaudible siren song
4676300 i suppose if i had to call it anything at all id call it an i a v
4676301 ah let me see it means an infinite alternative viewer
4676302 well dont quote me on this but i think this little gizmo could be a means of looking at events and places that might not necessarily exist but possibly could somewhere out there in the macro universe of space time and beyond
4676303 jeepers but isnt that the biggest load of bollocks ive ever heard you utter
4676304 and ive heard you utter bollocks of the highest order i can tell you
4676305 if i had a stomach id eat the lot and leave not a morsel for the evil heathen scavengers that inhabit the bowels of this lonely realm
4676306 its going to discover the source of the mysterious dust or so im reliably informed
4676307 what ya wanna go and do that for that hurt that did i was only having a good cough
4676308 this aint some weird dust from outer space i can taste caterpillar poo skin platelets and cigarette ash ere i know what this is this is household dust this is so howd that get ere then this aint no household
4676309 i present the answer to all of your questions and many you have yet to form
4676310 this device isnt foolproof it might not show us what we want to see it will just show us potentialities thats realities that could possibly exist
4676311 i dont think so i think theyre a potential version of us
4676312 sorry to burst in on you folks but i just found a hamster laying out in the yard
4676313 are they raving loonies that makes no bloomin sense at all
4676314 wha wha what were you doing fah fah five minutes ago
4676315 i guess that automatically puts you outta suspicion you were reading a book and havent got an alibi
4676316 so i imagine that you must be the evil perpetrator
4676317 youre the only rodent here 48 with a decent alibi
4676318 but i think were wasting our time watching a reality where logic has been replaced with complete arseholiness
4676319 i predict that within two weeks of its release next month the revovac rasputin will gain almost seventy five percent of the upright cleaner market youve all seen its multi tornadic venturi suck chute in action quite something youll agree do i hear otherwise
4676320 the rasputin doesnt have a dust bag it doesnt even have a receptacle for dust the dust goes in but it doesnt collect anywhere where does it go
4676321 i thought some wise arse would have to ask that fluffin question you little shite
4676322 our lab techs sure as shit cant im off for a coffee
4676323 what you wanna go and make one of them things for then
4676324 dont we already have one or two vacuum cleaners about the place already
4676325 of course youve created a device that does exactly what the original does it takes dust and household detritus and casts it into another realm
4676326 but returning the dust whence it came is not enough we must teach them a lesson we must nip this vacuum cleaner revolution in the bud we must discredit this revovac rasputin so that it will never be put into production it is of the utmost importance
4676327 if our duplicates get this thing to work on dust just imagine what other uses they might put it to in the future
4676328 who needs landfill or incinerators when you can just suck up the crap in what did they call this sucky uppy bit colin
4676329 but what do you reckon youre gonna do about it
4676330 but in order to carry it through successfully were going to need a long flexible pipe and access to the local cess pit
4676331 wowie if that isnt the most disgusting noise that ive ever heard then i dont know what is
4676332 how much longer do ya think you can keep him from learnin the truth
4676333 ill keep the truth from him until the day he dies if necessary i dont want to lose him again
4676334 for when david had served gods purpose in his own generation he fell asleep he was buried with his fathers and his body decayed
4676335 therefore my brothers i want you to know that through jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you
4676336 sorry jimmy he doesnt say we will break them whether we like it or not as if a magic string were holding us to it but rather that we just break them
4676337 delightful flesh and blood characters as richly conceived as those in any novel

4676347 there were three people at out table whom i had just met i doubt theyll be forgetting me i had to give a tara reid apology the nip slip because i had no control over my candies

4676358 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4676359 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the preseason flows so differently that you dont know how long the defense is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4676360 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4676361 theres going to be a big crowd out there the excitement thats being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come saturday
4676362 the big thing with him is getting comfortable with calling the plays
4676363 again the plays are the same thing but as a quarterback the more you call it the more you can become comfortable with it the more you can actually see the picture of the play in your mind
4676364 you see him in green bay and youre like you never know this guy could be throwing me passes someday and now that hes here its weird hes throwing me passes now and im just trying to make sure i dont make him mad and catch everything he throws my way
4676365 hopefully hell think hes so special that well only have to face him for a series or two
4676366 it would have been an easier offseason for me bretts all the hype and all the talk right now and thats fine now i can go back to work and just do what i do
4676367 itll be a lot different now for the both of us
4676368 im with the skins now and hes with the jets not that we played a lot against each other before but it will be different to see him out there with all the hoopla and the media stuff going on around the game at the end of the day its still football and hes got to throw before i get there
4676369 a case of the nerves both at the plate and on the mound
4676370 these guys are more nervous now than they were on the baseball field i promise
4676371 and i if i am lifted up from the earth will draw all men to myself

4676382 noland uses a mixture of fine art politics marketing and strategy to spread awareness and create enthusiasm about the obama campaign
4676383 early on i realized that for me being an artist also means being an entrepreneur and it means collaboration
4676384 we take the principles of theatre and creativity and bring them to business education and nonprofit organizations
4676385 and we work with people helping them tap into their creativity in order to become more visionary thinkers and more effective leaders
4676386 and telling stories in ones work and ones life is something that is universal it goes beyond acting
4676387 my work is based in my own personal belief that everybody is creative and when people have clearer access to their creativity and know how their creativity can serve them they can expand a vision for themselves and their company
4676388 i think the most wonderful thing that barnard gave me is permission when i arrived at barnard i was really focused on being a good student barnard gave me permission to be a true student
4676389 it helped me bring muscle and rigor to any kind of brainstorming process
4676390 you cannot recall that we barely escaped by the skin of our incisors

4676396 very good they are too i should know i just slaughtered forty two of em
4676397 what the fluff is a grimble if i hadnt blasted that crud with a dislocation beam at point blank range i remind you well toast doesnt even come close to describing our condition or custard either
4676398 okay if thats a spinbondin olifin how does it work
4676399 describe the act of spinbondin in what way is an olifin spinbonded conjugate the verb mutha fluffer
4676400 hah you dont know i put it to you that theres no such thing as an olifin and that if there was itd be impossible to spinbond one how say you respond with eloquence if you please
4676401 oh youve got me there how puzzling maybe were all going quite quite mad
4676402 well i cant imagine why i didnt think of this before
4676403 that electrical shock must have blown two or three of my logic circuits ill just realign them
4676404 i wont 63 bother your feeble hamster brain with an explanation
4676405 in order to discover why we all seem to have different memories of the last couple of hours we are going to repeat our previous actions were going to do it all over again call me over protective of myself if you like but isnt that a little foolhardy i mean its not like re winding a video tape we could get hurt this time
4676406 i could poop in me pants i only just avoided it last time one more fright and im apt to lose control of me rear end

4676453 the current study is sponsored by nemcog in partnership with otsego county mdot the city of gaylord bagley township hayes township livingston township the otsego county economic alliance and the otsego county road commission ocrc collectively these entities made up the technical steering committee for the project
4676454 in order to meet these purposes a three phase study was undertaken by the consultant team under the direction of the technical steering committee
4676455 after reviewing the results the technical steering committee concluded that the high growth scenarios would be used for evaluation and planning purposes as these most closely represent what would likely occur
4676456 public involvement activities undertaken as part of this study included four advisory committee meetings and two public information meetings the input received through these public involvement activities was taken into consideration by the technical steering committee as the study was conducted
4676457 after considering the evaluation information presented in section 4 and input received from members of the public presented in section 5 the consultant team developed recommendations regarding road improvements for consideration by the technical steering committee these recommendations were based on a location by location assessment of the benefits negative impacts and costs of the potential improvements these recommendations were discussed with the committee and revised based on their input to form the final recommendations in this report
4676458 table 3 shows the prioritized list of road improvements recommended by the consultant team and accepted by the steering committee
4676459 in addition the road improvements identified above the consultant team and technical steering committee also performed an overview evaluation of opportunities for aesthetic and nonmotorized enhancements

4676628 reported statements of the principals involved in that study references to related projects as cited and discussions with personnel involved in the selection of definition for a federal earmark for road improvements in otsego county
4676629 these goals led to development of the following project purposes which were used to evaluate the road improvement options that were eventually developed improve east west travel efficiency eliminate traffic congestion at the two interchanges eliminate non interchange traffic congestion improve freeway access and circulation for trucks reduce crashes especially on main street m 32 provide opportunities for aesthetic improvements and non motorized travel
4676630 2004 crossing study report or 2004 csr prepared by dlz michigan inc and midwestern consulting llc dated 2004 july this report is available on the internet from northeast michigan council of governments nemcog at http www nemcog org pdfs i 75 20crossover 20study final 20report pdf
4676631 kellogg emphasized that throughout the process of examining alternatives each will be compared to a do nothing approach in which the costs of doing nothing will be considered this will include such elements as future traffic lost travel time due to traffic goods and services that may not be able to be transported and road quality or the lack thereof those costs will be compared to the costs of each proactive alternative to help provide a cost benefit analysis of each proposal
4676632 by the end of the study our goal is to provide you with long term solutions and shorter stop gap solutions so you can get the best traffic operations as you go along
4676633 the solutions will be dictated by the definition of the problems
4676634 alternatives to building new roads will definitely be considered such as improving existing interchanges improving existing roads to handle more commercial traffic adding turn lanes to existing roads or changing traffic signals
4676635 the people made it clear theres a big problem on main street especially eastbound at the i 75 interchange
4676636 another interchange between the north and south interchanges is the least likely alternative there are significant obstacles to it
4676637 traffic from gaylords new 150 acre industrial park on milbocker road and the edelweiss shopping center on dickerson road would result in bottlenecks around the i 75 and m 32 junction
4676638 there are too many cars and too few options in the highly congested intersection at m 32 and dickerson road
4676639 take exit 282 off the highway of complacency and onto the road of participation which leads to a bright future for otsego county
4676640 the largest problem is at the interchange with m 32 which also is main street during busy drive times each day traffic backs up with motorists and tractor trailers waiting to get on and off the interstate
4676641 the other problem area is on the southern side of town where the i 75 interchange meets with otsego avenue also known as the i 75 business loop traffic there also tends to clog during rush hours
4676642 joe duff city manager for gaylord said there is no way the municipality could afford all of the work so state and federal assistance must be found
4676643 the true goal is to get another overpass at least one more
4676644 roper agreed adding that the recommended overpass to connect mccoy and millbocker roads would be best as another interchange allowing heavy vehicles bound for the industrial parks on millbocker road to avoid driving on any other local streets
4676645 how do we secure the 17 5 million needed to fund the i 75 crossover project
4676646 we did not want to let the plan sit on a shelf somewhere
4676647 our two goals were to clearly identify existing and future traffic problems related to east west travel across i 75 and to recommend short and long term solutions and provide recommendations for road improvement funding
4676648 the construction of an at grade crossing and i 75 interchange to reconnect milbocker and mccoy roads and a new overpass to reconnect van tyle and south wisconsin roads
4676649 heavy congestion at the m 32 i 75 interchange precipitated the need for the project
4676650 it gets so bad that they line up all the way to kohls
4676651 the new interchange is meant to reduce traffic in the busiest parts of town and allow heavy vehicles bound for the industrial parks on milbocker and dickerson roads to avoid driving on any other local streets
4676652 the timing was right on this project the presentation was essential to effectively communicate the urgent need the community has for these highway crossings
4676653 i have never in my 25 years in government seen anything move so fast
4676654 we will do what we can to facilitate this process
4676655 frankly this thing has to work we had to say no to so many other people in order to get the funding for this approved
4676656 although funds for two crossovers could have been budgeted for 2006 otsego county drivers eager to see relief from traffic congestion along m 32 at i 75 will have to wait at least one more year for project funding to be made available by the state
4676657 project selection decisions should be made by transportation service professionals at mdot
4676658 u s sen carl levin d detroit and state rep kevin elsenheimer r bellaire temper the celebration over the passage of the federal transportation bill telling a gathering of otsego county residents their task now is to convince the state to provide matching funds for the 12 million federal appropriation the money would be used to build an at grade crossing connecting milbocker and mccoy roads and to build an overpass at wisconsin ave and vantyle road
4676659 the clock is ticking on this project and time is of the essence
4676660 the state of michigan has not yet agreed to fund any portion of this project which is so vital to the state so we need to get the ball rolling
4676661 although capturing the funding before the clock runs out is an important issue duff sees the matter of convenience to county residents as equally important
4676662 we are interested in making life simpler for the people in this county
4676663 we believe traffic on the m 32 corridor will be reduced by 15 percent once the crossovers are in place
4676664 the short answer is yes although there has been nothing short about the wait not the lines of eastbound traffic backed up for miles on m 32 not the years invested in researching solutions and not least of all the last seven months when we knew we had federal money for the project but were forced to consider asking voters to approve a millage to get the crossovers built
4676665 the days of waiting through five cycles of red lights to turn onto dickerson road from m 32 may soon be a distant memory
4676666 recent michigan dept of transportation figures estimate 24 000 vehicles a day travel the stretch of m 32 between south otsego avenue and north townline road
4676667 the crossings would give local traffic a much needed alternative to m 32
4676668 traffic backups do occur at one location on eastbound m 32 from the light at dickerson long trucks turn very slowly at both turns even backing up peak traffic from the i 75 entrance past dickerson to the west
4676669 the traffic is congested only during the tourist season so it stands to reason that vehicle traffic will still be heavy on the m 32 corridor west regardless of how many crossovers i 75 may have as west m 32 is the main highway to u s 131 and the shopping centers which were allowed to build west of town
4676670 were basing the crossover recommendations on traffic studies done by professionals
4676671 voters came out 4 831 against 2 117 in favor
4676672 thats fine were willing to accept that and move on
4676673 duff said wednesday morning the task force has contacted sen
4676674 in earlier meetings levin put the ball in our court and said you have to get your act together too
4676675 according to ratcliffe the task force reviewed six proposals which followed federal highway administration guidelines for selecting an engineering consultant before making their recommendation
4676676 its progressing thats encouraging so far we feel were meeting our deadlines
4676677 based on the results from a comprehensive 2004 otsego county traffic study the i 75 crossing connecting mccoy and milbocker roads will only provide a convenience to a few local residents
4676678 does not solve peak hour traffic congestion problems present and future at the two existing i 75 interchanges
4676679 we feel from a road commission perspective that its still money well spent
4676680 im totally familiar with the m 32 problem its a bottleneck
4676681 if we miss this opportunity we may never get the crossing and i believe we need it to make later changes to m 32
4676682 no one thing is going to solve the traffic problems we wouldnt be doing it if we didnt think it was worthwhile
4676683 we went through a lot of hurdles to secure that earmark

4676784 im not giving away the store when i say that fernando gonzalez is as tough a gold medal opponent as rafael nadal could have drawn
4676785 all of this makes me feel for nadal who based solely on his appearance could be just as easily be taken for chinese or asian at any rate as spanish has anybody else noticed that he might have been separated at birth from short track ice skating marvel apolo anton ono
4676786 apparently the spanish celebrate every win over china in anything by pulling back the skin at their temples to slant their eyes ha ha ha ha
4676787 but then the spanish basketball team gets busted for a frat house grade photo prank that was offensive to politically correct folks and simply sophomoric to more tolerant folks

4676791 after that match blake upset over a point late in a long third set essentially accused gonz lez of cheating
4676792 the semifinal between blake and gonz lez ended on a sour note
4676793 yeah hit a shot that hit fernandos racquet and then went out
4676794 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4676795 if im 100 percent sure about it i will give it but im not sure
4676796 how do i make it appear that nadals win today wasnt a big deal
4676797 i knew it touched me but i wasnt going to say so
4676798 the spanish are doing woefully in these games even if you already count nadals guaranteed silver medal kazakhstan has nearly twice as many medals as spain and so does armenia
4676799 the spanish will certainly improve their performance and pretty dramatically and thats fine with me
4676800 oh yeah com im really trying to whip people into an anti spanish frenzy here its been my lifelong dream amigo right up ahead of ruling the world
4676801 nadal who based solely on his appearance could be just as easily be taken for chinese or asian at any rate as spanish
4676802 and why would the us players want to insult the japanese its not like they lost the game to them
4676803 it just makes the spanish tennis players look silly stuck in stereotypes
4676804 that s the point sic and the only plausible reason for their upset is that the us and british media has historical problems with equality of human beings and human rights
4676805 its not as though i see anyone saying that the possession of an epicanthic fold is inferior or unattractive
4676806 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
4676807 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
4676808 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
4676809 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
4676810 some of us didnt feel comfortable doing it to me it was a little clownish on our part to be doing that the sponsor insisted and insisted they pushed because theyre the people that pay the money it was just a bad idea to do that it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
4676811 id like to solicit rolo tomassi andrew friedman s views on whether blakes responses at the press conference met the high standards he held federer to after the wimbledon final this year andrew was quite exercised about federers alluding to the light as a factor both in the on court interview and later on at his press conference it seems to me that blake made a far bigger issue of his disappointment over his perception that gonzalez had done him wrong than federer did over the light at the end of that match
4676812 christopher has previously noted that his work gives him insight into chinese culture i personally had never heard of westernised chinese people having surgery on their epicanthic folds
4676813 but wait blake saw it as he aimed at gonzo and was expecting a result he did not get which is valid if it works but it did not

4676820 how is it that a book given by god to transform seems so unproductive when taught in the very churches where it is most honored and best known our christian education has often reproduced warped personalities our teaching has often failed to straighten twisted lives warping is so common that weve become used to it used to shaking our heads about lost faith in high school and college students used to congregations and individuals without vitality or dedication or reality in their walk with christ used to an exploding population and a sputtering evangelism used to living day after day with men and women who need the savior and used to saying nothing to them about him used to reading and studying and teaching the bible without seeing god use it to transform have we been successful in reproducing the biblical faith in our modern world have we turned the world upside down as did the early church are our churches filled with spiritual giants hardly teaching the bible as we teach it has not transformed men as our theology says the word of god should but why not is it possible that we havent really understood the nature of the bible we teach is it possible that we havent been teaching the bible in a way that harmonizes with gods purpose in giving it

4676822 only a hundred miles from madrid at a spot where forbidding mountains give way to the endless plains of la mancha lies the isolated medieval town of cuenca spectacular in its tormented hilltop setting this brooding place of silence and mystery makes an unusual one day trip well off the usual tourist trail it is doubtful whether you will find any other americans there until quite recently this city of 35 000 souls was practically inaccessible today it is linked with the capital by decent transport facilities
4676823 originally a roman site cuenca in the 9th century became a moslem stronghold under the catholic monarchs it prospered for a while then fell into decline in the 17th century surviving the heavy damage of the civil war of 1937 cuenca is now the capital of the province of the same name
4676824 cuenca is completely a vertical town everything is above or below everything else streets give way to steps roads become footpaths although short the walking tour described involves strenuous exercise that cannot be escaped add to this a base altitude of 3 000 feet above sea level and it will be quickly realized that this trip should not be taken by people in poor physical condition for the rest of us a days excursion to cuenca is a wonderful stroll into a different world
4676825 from madrids atocha station near the prado take the 9 10 talgo train marked for valencia which arrives in cuenca at 11 30 a m this train requires reservations even with a eurailpass you would be better off making reservations the day before if possible unlike other european countries which are rather relaxed about reservation requirements the spanish railroad renfe will not let you on an express train without a reservation period there is a caf car if you would like to have breakfast on the train there are no other practical trains to cuenca please check the schedule first as the times have a way of changing for the return journey the same talgo train leaves cuenca at 5 44 p m arriving in madrid at 8 p m reservations for this can be made at the cuenca station whose ticket office is closed until 30 minutes before train departure time if you should miss this train there is a local to madrid at about 7 p m
4676826 for those who are driving take route n111 from madrid to taranc n then left on n400 to cuenca park in the modern lower part of town and pick up the walking tour from there it is madness to attempt driving in the old upper part of town
4676827 to appreciate the natural beauty and spectacular setting of cuenca requires good clear weather which is common in spain the late spring early summer and fall are the best seasons mid summer being very hot and winter quite cold the six hours between the arrival and departure of the talgo trains is adequate to fully see the town and have a leisurely lunch the museums are closed on mondays
4676828 there are several restaurants in the old town the best being the somewhat expensive
4676829 leaving the train station 1 follow avenida general moscardo to calle fermin caballero which becomes calle cervantes walk past plaza del generalisimo and along avenida de jose antonio to plaza de c sotelo near which is located the tourist office so far the walk has been through a rather uninteresting modern town but the character begins to change when you make a right onto calle f l de leon which leads you across the huecar stream and up into the old town climb straight up then turn right onto posito immediately make a left on calle de la esperanza past the church of el salvador then left on calle solera past a park and the church of san felipe
4676830 follow calle alfonso viii to the right and uphill to the baroque town hall ayuntamiento 2 an early 18th century arched building that opens into the plaza mayor this the main square of the old town is dominated by the cathedral 3 photo left built in the late 12th century on the site of a mosque the style is norman gothic with romanesque features and renaissance decoration it is considered to be one of the most interesting cathedrals in spain and is certainly worth a visit the treasury contains a priceless collection of chalices croziers a byzantine diptych and two el greco paintings be sure to see the cathedral before lunch as it closes at 1 pm and does not reopen until 4 30
4676831 leaving the cathedral follow the streets on its side to the archaeological museum museo arqueol gico 4 located in a 14th century former parish house the collection is particularly noted for its roman coins mosaics ceramics and statuary as well as celtic and prehistoric pieces again be sure to see it before lunch as it is closed between 1 30 p m and 5 also all day on mondays
4676832 from here it is only a few steps down to the famous hanging houses 5 top photo which contain the museum of abstract art and the mes n casas colgadas restaurant these unbearably romantic buildings jutting out in space above the cliffs far below were probably built in the 14th century reputedly as the summer residence of the king the museum they now house the only one of its kind in spain is devoted to the works of contemporary spanish painters and sculptors open 11 2 and 4 6 closed mondays so make your visit before lunch which in any case is never served before 2 p m
4676833 a passage under these buildings leads sharply downhill to a rickety pedestrian bridge 6 130 feet above the narrow huecar stream from which fine views of the hanging houses and surrounding cliffs may be had another good viewpoint is downhill on the other side of the entrance to the hanging houses to a small park
4676834 it should now be time for lunch which can be had either at the casa colgadas or around plaza mayor
4676835 that finished stroll up calle de san pedro making the two short side steps shown on the map past the 17th century church of san pedro 7 and through the archway of the remains of alfonso viiis castle 8 now a parador
4676836 the view photo above from here across the jucar is of wild staggering cliffs and deep ravines slashed through a desolate arid landscape very reminiscent of americas southwest
4676837 returning through the archway bear to the right and downhill along the ronda del jucar pathway this leads to the santuario de nuestra se ora de las augustias 9 a franciscan monastery located on the very picturesque plaza de los descalzos
4676838 climb back uphill to the path at the top of the cliff and follow it to the church of san miguel 10 now used as a concert hall now walk along the edge of the cliff until you come to an alleyway on the left leading back to plaza mayor
4676839 from the town hall 2 take the steps to the right up calle santa maria ayala through plaza de merced to the clock tower torre de mangana 11 once part of a moorish fortress to which later alterations were made follow around past plaza del carmen and down steps on the right to calle general mola which leads you downhill on the right is an archway with spectacular views dont go down this too far as youll have to come back up again
4676840 in a few steps calle general mola becomes a charming pedestrian street to the right walk downhill on this to a park at the bottom turn left crossing the huecar stream then right to a bridge 12 over the larger jucar cross this for a good view of the rivers and old town then back again to see the waterfalls
4676841 past the park go up the inclined path calle de cerillo santiago which turns to the left over steps when you come to an intersection turn to the right and up more steps past small houses and flower gardens to a little square here make a sharp left and down many steps to the main street calle calderon de la barca a right here leads back into the new town from which you can retrace your steps back to the train station 1
4676842 if you have not made your reservation for the return to madrid do so now there is a small colorfully dingy caf at the station where you can pass the time waiting for the train
4676843 unfortunately my admission has incurred some longtime political enemies and those hoping to profit from this situation

4676862 novak needs to actually beat rafa on a big stage slam and then it will ignite the rivalry
4676863 he lost in the olympics but that was best of two
4676864 imo anyone who argues that nadal is just a defensive player hasnt watched much tennis in the last two years he still makes a living by being the best defensive player on tour but hes become no 1 as of next monday by improving his offensive play in leaps and bounds
4676865 anyone who argues that nadal is just a defensive player hasnt watched much tennis in the last two years he still makes a living by being the best defensive player on tour but hes become no 1 as of next monday by improving his offensive play in leaps and bounds

4676867 jelena jankovic is set to lose her no 1 ranking next week after only a week she will become the third women to do this after henin 2003 and sharapova 2005 both of these women regained there top spot the future looks bright for jankovic lol
4676868 if they meet again so soon after novak was so disappointed i doubt well get a similarly close contest
4676869 the last true worlds 1 was queen justine and the rest have been pretenders to her throne
4676870 violetta honestly the roger rafa rivalry is pretty damn one sided too at least in 2008
4676871 with all due respect to fed how the hail can someone see him winning the french before rafa wins ao and uso
4676872 violetta honestly the roger rafa rivalry is pretty damn one sided too at least in 2008
4676873 sure looked to me like the ball touched gonzalez racquet on the way through but he didnt seem to think so and the umpire didnt call it any more questions youll have to ask him
4676874 here is why i hate nadal and why he is an inferior player
4676875 as an aside i think it stinks that gonzo didnt concede that point
4676876 he is cute not fabulously handsome but those medals and the seven figure salary that comes with them will assure that he will have his pick of the young female companionship hopefully he will find one who genuinely likes him as a person and not just using him for his fame
4676877 mark during his playing days at least we could agree with that behavior but how come a guy so pleasant in front of the camera and commentary booth gets back to the bad boy mode on the court does he do it intentionally but i really dont think that johny mac is that cheap a person to seek attention in those shoddy ways
4676878 fedex is out of the mix probably as a result of excessive concentration on agents promos profile development endorsements etc now it is difficult for him to get back to the top
4676879 sure looked to me like the ball touched gonzalez racquet on the way through but he didnt seem to think so and the umpire didnt call it any more questions youll have to ask him

4676883 lol grant i cant disagree im just commenting on the ever changing vernacular
4676884 as for blake i do agree that he couldve been more diplomatic during this presser that said i dont begrudge his complaining about gonzos sportsmanship i mean who wouldnt be pissed if he did believe his opponent was faking ignorance of an obvious error by the umpire if you say blake showed a lack of composure and diplomacy id chalk it up to his misunderstanding rather than his supposed ego or immaturity
4676885 it is like a brain worm that commercial and now it is tuck in my head thanks to those pesky kids who work with grant
4676886 yep now we ll get a medal this sport is on the back of a horse

4676891 my entire family is in amroha why should i stay away so when i began doing covers professionally i moved back home
4676892 ive been doing this for such a long time that publishers have hundreds of unused drawings of mine
4676893 now with their photoshop they only need to cut and switch parts of them around to make new covers
4676894 sometimes ill just call the author and ask for more information about the story
4676895 and then ill finish the cover in between two and five days and courier it to the publisher i do seven or eight of these a month
4676896 i showed some of my designs to publishers and they liked them
4676897 in 1971 i remember id be paid rs25 for each cover
4676898 if they were selling lakhs and lakhs of books as in the olden days id be able to ask for rs10 000 per design
4676899 there are serials and films to watch on television and people have started reading only what they absolutely need to
4676900 now only he sells around 60 000 at a price of rs40 per book

4676904 theres no creativity at all but the publishers dont seem to care
4676905 id like to learn to use this design software myself if it wasnt for the strain on my eyes

4676921 he just doesnt see the offensiveness that i perceive so different strokes for different folks have to say though even if the intent wasnt racist i cant believe they were stupid enough to take such a politically incorrect photo it shows a massive lack of sensitivity if nothing else
4676922 i think it is less a case of racism and more a situation of demonstrating rudeness towards ones host
4676923 chestertown are you implying that if someone finds that photo racially offesnive they are the ones who are racist not the people in the photo

4676927 hey chestertown some of my best friends are absurd ghots
4676928 backhand mcsame is talking that he wants to kick russia outta the g8
4676929 that s the point sic and the only plausible reason for their upset is that the us and british media has historical problems with equality of human beings and human rights
4676930 its not as though i see anyone saying that the possession of an epicanthic fold is inferior or unattractive
4676931 i think the last games of the 1st set shook rafa a bit and worried him

4677081 but what primarily struck me is that he loves you and believes in you and looks out for you in a way you dont get from your mother
4677082 it brightens my heart that you had that sort of love in your life somewhere even if it didnt come until you were an adult
4677083 i am the same person who answered the phones for them in many ways but i am so different at the same time
4677084 you have grown into a leader not a follower i suspect youve always been one though even when you had no one to lead
4677085 he said as much to me apparently you were quite a funny young woman always mother henning the attorneys even though you were essentially still a child yet you had a sharp and sometimes caustic wit he used to wonder what it was about your life that made you so much the dichotomy
4677086 he knows though when youd been there 18 months he couldnt figure out why you were always broke and was concerned that you were using drugs or something
4677087 me i think ill have to give him hell for that tomorrow
4677088 i think he suspects thatd exactly be your reaction at any rate he had the firms investigator do a deep background check and found the truth
4677089 twasnt any of his business it was right about then when i finally stopped being afraid he was going to fire me up to that point i went in every morning sure it was my last but one morning he came in and actually said good work as he walked by i was so shocked i stared after him sure i must have misheard him after that things started getting better and luckily a year later my mother finished her degrees and i could focus more on making some progress
4677090 and 18 months after that so i was 24 he called me into his office and told me he wanted me to plan a reception for his clients and that was that i stopped being scared of him and i think we got to understand each other better
4677091 he threatened me that if i did not take care of you properly i would have him to answer to treaty or no
4677092 as i said i am grateful that someone from your world cares enough about you to do so

4677113 being a graduate student is like becoming all of the seven dwarves in the beginning youre dopey and bashful in the middle you are usually sick sneezy tired sleepy and irritable grumpy but at the end they call you doc and then youre happy
4677114 what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure
4677115 at the start you may have to do tasks specifically related to the funding contracts
4677116 graduate school is not primarily about taking courses you will take classes in the beginning but in your later years you probably wont have any classes
4677117 your success in graduate school and beyond depends a great deal upon your ability to build and maintain interpersonal relationships with your adviser your committee your research and support staff and your fellow students
4677118 since academia is a type of business you will have responsibilities that you must uphold you will be asked to greet and talk with visitors give demos show up to meetings get projects done on time etc if you are not well organized you will have a difficult time meeting those obligations there are many different time management and organization skills arrange the tasks in priority and you can find many books on those at your local bookstore
4677119 communication skills both written and oral are vital for making a good impression as a ph d student and as a researcher unfortunately not all graduate students receive training in giving presentations or writing technical documents which are different from english essays these are skills that can be learned its not easy but its well worth the investment if you need practice try giving informal talks at research luncheons joining toastmasters and studying good speakers to see what they do
4677120 confidence is the key to giving a good presentation and the way to gain confidence is to give good presentations here are a few basic points organization counts within the first few paragraphs or first few minutes tell me why i should read your paper or listen to your talk make it clear where we are going and what we have already covered make the text in your slides large enough so that people sitting in the back can read them for large presentation halls this usually means no more than 6 7 lines per slide and 28 point type minimum youd be surprised how many experts on visualization especially tenured professors give presentations with unreadable slides variety retains interest vary your pace tone and volume emphasize the important points look around the room throw in some video pictures or live examples dont stand in front of the screen and block everyones view youd be surprised how often people do this without realizing it point out the limitations of your work that helps your credibility similarly give credit where credit is due make friends with the a v crew running a v is a thankless negative reinforcement job if everything runs smoothly well thats what was supposed to happen so nobody says anything but if anything goes wrong the entire audience looks back at the control room help the a v people help you always check in early and test the equipment tell them what you are going to do in your presentation e g im running 3 video segments make sure you know how everything works long before you come up to the podium and thank the a v crew for their help after you are done writing papers and getting them published is vital for ph d students who want to get jobs in research after graduation your ability to write well significantly improves the chances that your paper will be accepted finally dont forget to communicate with your professors and your teammates keep your committee appraised of your progress one thing i do which few others do is write short 1 screenfull status reports which i religiously e mailed to my professors and team members on a weekly basis these serve as an efficient way of keeping everyone up to date on what im doing they are also a good way for me to record my progress if i need to remember what i got done during a six month period i have plenty of old status reports that i can read youd be amazed how appreciative professors and managers are of this simple practice i also throw in a different humorous quote at the end of each weeks report to reward people for reading it when you are working in the lab and you reach a milestone or achieve a result let people know about it bring in your professors and fellow students and show it off thats a win win situation it lets others know that you are making progress and achieving results and you get valuable feedback and advice
4677121 your adviser must be someone who can cover your area of specialization and someone you can get along with and if circumstances change to make another professor a more appropriate match to your needs dont be afraid to switch if that is an overall win
4677122 it is important to have a network get yourself noticed by other professors and industry people

4677219 the talk is always about being physical but not so much about the action its just a mindset its an attitude and a bit of technique that we need to work on
4677220 i just pointed out that our attitude and being technically very good at the breakdown will get us through there and being physical is just a by product of that
4677221 it was just a matter of showing them a few clips here and there and making sure the guys understood where they needed to improve and what they needed to do
4677222 things like working hard off the ball and trying to be balanced going into the breakdown and keeping our head up and making sure we maintain or take that space

4677224 weve got to make sure that we are there in numbers and working as hard as we can to make sure we secure the ball or try and turn it over like we did against them in perth

4677242 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could
4677243 i think the biggest thing is when someone says you cant do something
4677244 it shows that anything is possible when you put your mind to it
4677245 if anyone would have said before the games that id win two golds and break the world record id have laughed in their face
4677246 what im trying to do is stake out what i call the common ground for the common good
4677247 i think there are a lot of americans who are disaffected by both the left and the right whether its the secular left or the religious left or whether its the secular right or religious right
4677248 thoroughly enjoyed the lively selections the editors choices were completely engaging and shared a true taste of the world i plan on carrying this title in my bookstore

4677250 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4677251 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4677252 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4677253 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4677254 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4677255 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4677256 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4677257 the new facility and pilot line gives the company the infrastructure to move our technology from the prototype stage to a market ready product this puts the company on track to bring volume manufacturing capability online in 2009
4677258 we are excited to work together with sigen in order to develop and industrialize this new technology
4677259 provided we can reach sufficient scalability and productivity in the new manufacturing equipment and that all the remaining developments are equally successful as the first phase this should enable us to manufacture next generation pv wafers and cells with high efficiency at an even lower cost than with todays sawing processes
4677260 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4677261 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4677262 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4677263 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4677264 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4677265 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4677266 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4677267 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4677268 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4677269 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4677270 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4677271 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4677272 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4677277 this scale is really wonderful and it is certainly evident a lot of thought and consideration has gone into it i think it will be a helpful tool especially to people who do not deal much with ephemera to understand what makes a piece special it could also be very helpful to collection managers and archivists to help quantify the scarcity of ephemera in museum and library archive collections

4677282 we believe the word team is overused in corporate america a team is more than a group of people working together to be a real team there must be a team spirit with each person genuinely caring about his or her teammates success teams that win have chemistry and synergy with members focusing on doing their own job well and assisting others whenever they can a successful team is consistently fighting and winning battles over selfishness a difficult and noble feat to achieve lets face it we all have our personal agendas to surrender our individual ego to the good of the team takes work sacrifice trust and courage

4677310 ignore underfund and push under the rug the immigration problem unless its politically expedient to persecute
4677311 i am hoping that one day i can create a manga about my life
4677312 some parts of the story resemble native american history genocide burning of their crops destruction of livestock racism concentration camps separation of families and the government forcing young children to attend boarding schools
4677313 thats because manga produces a variety of genres that marvel and dc dont
4677314 to many young americans japanese pop culture has a feeling of being fresh and it can therefore be perceived as an alternative to native u s pop culture traditions
4677315 the japanese culture contained in the manga is interesting japanese have a different sense of humor some things are not shocking to them but are to us some things are funny to them but not to us it is always fun to figure that out
4677316 when i think about western pornography its not terribly interesting
4677317 but i find the japanese stuff very imaginative playboy and penthouse have their comics but theyre not well developed usually four panels and thats it
4677318 im not afraid of seeing pubic hair i have pubic hair everywhere
4677319 illicit sex relations are neither to be hinted at nor portrayed
4677320 violent love scenes as well as sexual abnormalities are unacceptable
4677321 a growing and potentially significant phenomenon in the u s comics market
4677322 since the occupation after the second world war japan absorbed enormous quantities of american pop culture japanese samurai movies borrowed heavily from american westerns just as pokemon borrowed from american comic traditions but in both cases what they added made these forms seem excited and different
4677323 its kind of like rock n roll music it starts in the u s heads overseas for some cultural laundering and comes back again in the form of the british invasion
4677324 i dont know who the creators are and no customers ordered these titles
4677325 the creators dont have the vision they should just leave it alone
4677326 its interesting to see our culture tied together in literature
4677327 superman is the icon of america and dc comics will always strive to maintain that by continuously propagating the character in movies and merchandise
4677328 and thats stopping manga from crashing totally through the door
4677329 i still want my superheroes they are who i grew up with

4677331 i have something to tell you that is going to change your life
4677332 permit me to introduce the tool you have in your hands let me use a musical illustration i have approached psalm 51 like a piece of sheet music the key signature the time signature the notes and the dynamic markings that are on the page are there because that is precisely what the great composer designed to be there this devotional book is not my attempt to help you to understand each note on the page no this book is more like jazz while endeavoring to stay inside gods key signature and time signature i have attempted to introduce to you creative practical everyday life riffs on the themes that make up the music of grace of this wonderful psalm think about it this is exactly how you live your life as a christian god hasnt given you in the bible the exact notes to play in every situation in your life no in the bible he gives you a divinely inspired musical structure the history command principles and perspectives that flow out of the narrative of scripture and invites you to improvise harmoniously with him in this way the life of a believer is more like jazz than it is playing off sheet music so what you have in your hands is devotional jazz designed to help you improvise more harmoniously with the great composer

4677398 the last three or four records ive done are mostly talking about the big questions life death love and not love and where the whole things going
4677399 since i started recording again around 20 years ago 22 actually ive been writing about the same sorts of things its just about my own growing perception of it and how clear can i make it
4677400 i guess im making it clearer because people dont often ask me what the songs are about anymore its a process of engagement when you write a song youve got three or four minutes to get a hold of somebody and if they can remember one phrase or line when they walk away from it youve won and i think ive accomplished that
4677401 new tunes not only have a freshness of their own but they also freshen up all the old material as well they cast a new light on it
4677402 not for a minute do i believe the songs come from anyplace but inside of me but at the same time theres an otherness to them that continually surprises me why does it take so long for them to become part of my conscious self its an interesting problem but ive talked to enough writers to realize im far from unique in that respect
4677403 i was basically drunk for 12 years and somehow i managed to climb out of it i dont know why why did i get well when so many other people dont it had nothing to do with any virtue on my part if i were christian id call it grace i just got lucky mostly you just get tired of it so when you get sufficiently tired of it you either descend into utter obliteration or you get out and so i got out
4677404 he got sidetracked and he learned a lot but its definitely the same guy
4677405 the other interesting thing is that i had to go through all the horrible stuff to get where i am now its part and parcel of the animal thats walking around today its unfortunate that i stayed so unproductive for so long but at the same time i couldnt write the kind of stuff that i write now if i hadnt gone through it i wouldnt realize what it is to be a human not really i might think i did but it wouldnt be the same
4677406 this may sound a little self important maybe but i like to hold these things up and say these are the people i consider my peers and my stuff stands up to this
4677407 the word of god becomes flesh during the day during meditation during holy communion during contemplation during adoration during silence
4677408 yes i accept whatever you give and i give whatever you take
4677409 i have been going walking at a park to pray this park is near a building that we would like to own for our church i go to this park so that i can pray and ask god to guide us and lead us in this area and especially with this building and the people in this area now i can no longer go to this park to pray and talk to god you see there is this red winged black bird that bothers me there the bird pesters me the bird makes it impossible for me to have time with god the bird flys around and almost attacks me if i go to the park it totally takes away from my special time with god it is like the devil i no longer feel safe in the park lately our church has had people who are like that red winged black bird they keep us from having time with god they distract us from god they keep us from our goals and from having special time with god

4677418 the reservoir road in my hometown of katonah is a beautiful powerful and creative place the songs on life grows back grew from my time on that dirt road these past two years ive been walking there since i was a little kid my mom used to walk it with me i feel so much at ease and at peace as i venture onto the riding trail to be by the stream i am at home there with the trees and the rocks and with the water in the flow i have so much history there it is the place that has taught me about impermanence and how to be comfortable with change everything is the same and everything is different

4677448 the talk is always about being physical but not so much about the action its just a mindset its an attitude and a bit of technique that we need to work on
4677449 i just pointed out that our attitude and being technically very good at the breakdown will get us through there and being physical is just a by product of that
4677450 it was just a matter of showing them a few clips here and there and making sure the guys understood where they needed to improve and what they needed to do
4677451 things like working hard off the ball and trying to be balanced going into the breakdown and keeping our head up and making sure we maintain or take that space
4677452 they south africa are probably technically not the same as new zealand going into the breakdown but they use a lot of power
4677453 weve got to make sure that we are there in numbers and working as hard as we can to make sure we secure the ball or try and turn it over like we did against them in perth
4677454 we were very good at getting numbers there and competing consistently and we turned over a few balls
4677455 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4677456 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything i had to take my goggles off to make sure the 1 was next to my name
4677457 when i saw the 50 58 and the 50 59 and i saw the 1 next to my name thats when i sort of let my roar out
4677458 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4677459 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could
4677460 i think the biggest thing is when someone says you cant do something
4677461 it shows that anything is possible when you put your mind to it

4677464 terradyne builds equipment that tests chips for any electronic device you can think of one of our big customers is broadcom which makes cell phones and communication equipment as an engineering manager i oversee the design efforts to verify that the chips used in our chip testers actually work

4677466 of the 60 people i manage 50 are in india and the rest in north reading a few years ago we all would have been in america

4677469 for years i had trailered my laser around and wanted a avoid the big production of finding a harbor to get to the water my aunt polly emilita a westport real estate broker showed me the place on juniper road that had dock access and i said this is it
4677470 a laser is a 14 olympic racing class one design one person sailboat one of the most popular sailboats there is there are a gazillion of them and i love racing them
4677471 i have a 17 seaway skiff at the dock and a 28 cape dory power boat in the harbor off wyc for cruising we cruise to block island the vineyard edgartown and nantucket im still trying to convince my wife to set out on friday nights as soon as we get here but its usually on saturday mornings
4677472 my favorite place to body surf is at baker beach theres a spot off the flagpole there where the bottom contour makes the water break there consistently good my dad was a life guard at coast guard beach when he was in college and he taught me how to body surf
4677473 i love this for safety i did a survival test dunked myself in the water the struggle i had to get back in the boat awakened me to how dangerous it could be i cautious now and dont go out when its rough
4677474 im kind of a big kid and love toys i have a mindstorms lego kit and designed a model of a self balancing motorcycle its computer controlled so after i built it i wrote the software for it it had a balance sensor so if it was starting to fall over it would straighten itself out by steering that way
4677475 we live next to the aquarium so when i get out of work i head for the boston sailing center and cruise the harbor in a j 24
4677476 i bought an aquaskippper to use off the dock its made of aircraft aluminum weighs 26 pounds is 6 long and is designed to be self propelled sort of like a pogo stick you have to get a rhythm going or you sink luckily it floats
4677477 our first date was a cruise to see the sunrise at the entrance to boston harbor on one or our early times together we did a week long cruise up to provincetown and around to nantucket on boat thats when i figured it was going really well if you can live a week on a boat with someone and have a great time thats a good sign

4678112 what we need is obviously the guys were counting on the guys that are making a significant amount of money that have significant performance levels to get the job done as expected and ill throw myself involved in that too i want to make sure im not pointing fingers were all in this thing together
4678113 its definitely good to get the opportunity to go out there and be that guy
4678114 we just felt that it was time for him to go work on some things you cant forget how young melky is
4678115 we believe that hes a much better player than a 240 hitter

4678422 apostles carry a blueprint in their hearts concerning the church and gods purposes on the earth they are used to bring fresh revelation to the church
4678423 one of the things that helped to keep the early church strong and healthy was their continual devotion to the apostles doctrine
4678424 peter understood this when he exhorted the church concerning present truth 7
4678425 that phrase is to direct our attention to that which the lord is emphasizing for this season
4678426 that is the apostles doctrine the word coming from apostles is to bring clarification of the fathers focus for the church and in turn strengthen our resolve to his purposes fresh revelation carries fresh fire which helps us to maintain the much needed fire in our souls
4678427 wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth
4678428 so then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god
4678429 its a good thing that abrahams only connection with god was not just over what was said but was based upon what he was saying

4678431 while doctrine is vitally important it is not a strong enough foundation to bear the weight of his glory that is about to be revealed through true unity

4678555 when they reached the drawing room upholstered in pink cretonne and lighted by a dim lamp they sat down at the table she on a sofa and peter ivanovich on a low pouffe the springs of which yielded spasmodically under his weight
4678556 as he sat down on the puffe peter ivanovich recalled how ivan ilych had arranged this room and had consulted him regarding this pink cretonne with green leaves
4678557 she made it appear that she was asking peter ivanovichs advice about her pension but he soon saw that she already knew about that to the minutest detail more even than he did himself
4678558 to say that ivan llych married because he fell in love with praskovya fedorovna and found that she sympathized with his views of life would be as incorrect as tot say that he married because his social circle approved of the match
4678559 she began to wish he would die yet she did not want him to die because then his salary would cease

4678619 the way the attack was conducted is very much similar to previous attacks throughout the years at el al counters therefore unfortunately given this history we presume that it may and would appear to be a terrorist attack

4678640 now its a matter of when his mobility comes back he can play again
4678641 i was watching him and i was thinking to myself youre pitching on the olympic team in this venue and you were just in high school a couple of years ago
4678642 its amazing that hes gotten to that stage what a great opportunity for him and for us as an organization to have two guys over there that are that young with that exposure on the world stage

4678648 the typical number of charge discharge cycles for the battery pack is around 300 to 500
4678649 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4678650 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4678651 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time hes the greatest racer who ever walked the planet
4678652 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4678653 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4678654 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4678655 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4678656 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4678657 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4678658 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4678659 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4678660 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4678661 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4678662 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4678663 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing im so happy to get the medal
4678664 im not concerned he had a great week of practice hes had a great camp and hell bounce back and hope his numbers are better
4678665 jamarcus took care of the ball im very pleased i just need to get over the end of the game
4678666 weve got more plays in our offense than what yall seen today just going to continue to keep working
4678667 its preseason thats why we work i continue to get better and better i hate it because ive got to hear these questions like this every time something like that happens at the same time i know im going to get better
4678668 as long as i put it in his vicinity hes going to catch it
4678669 good on those who are persistent and willing to not let the issue go
4678670 what i can do is do a courtesy exchange but it wont happen again cause there is not an issue with 3g
4678671 using the iphone on a network it is not designed for may break the iphone
4678672 oh no sir we inform all our customers before we sell them the 3g iphone
4678673 well no one informed me i wouldnt have bought one had i known but i guess thats the plan wouldnt sell as many phones if people knew the truth lying by omission is still lying
4678674 as much as the chip may be the chief problem glitches may also stem from apples software or the at amp t network part of the role of the infineon chip is to check whether theres enough 3g bandwidth available in a given area if 3g isnt available or there isnt enough bandwidth the iphone will be shifted to a slower network one source says apple programmed the infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3g signal than the iphone really requires so if too many people try to make a call or go on the internet in a given area some of the devices will decide theres insufficient power and switch to the slower network even if there is enough 3g bandwidth available according to this person the problems are only occurring in areas of high iphone density these include the san francisco bay area boston and certain overseas locales the reason the problem has gotten worse in recent days is because of the steep increase in iphone activations in these places the more people who are trying to use a given piece of gear the more likely they are to get bumped
4678675 go downtown and put your name on it so no one else can take that design thats your design you could get lots of money off of that one day
4678676 its been a long time since a swimmer has been a poster child of the olympics like this
4678677 it really raises the level of awareness about swimming both for the casual lap swimmer and for kids interested in learning to swim but it also increases interest in competitive swimming
4678678 its something that michael said he wanted to do four years ago and hes certainly managed to do that
4678679 nice work democrats and you thought bogus laws like this were only in place in tinpot dictatorships like zimbabwe and venezuela

4678684 the guy in the room in the worst suit is probably the highest ranking government officer the guy everyone wants to talk to
4678685 even though new york has this reputation for being hard nosed and competitive you want to live to fight another day
4678686 you win this case they win that case you win this deal point they win that deal point you dont want to destroy the other party
4678687 when they go after you they want to kill you
4678688 they want to drain your blood they want a special prosecutor appointed they want to send you to jail i warned president clinton not to appoint a special prosecutor to deal with whitewater unfortunately he didnt listen and he regrets it
4678689 finance guys in new york openly mock and ridicule lawyers as peons who make peanuts
4678690 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today

4678721 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could
4678722 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4678723 the last two olympics i have been able to nail my finishes im happy and at a loss for words but excited
4678724 as canadians i feel that were more accepting and more supportive of womens rights and a womans right to choose what she wants to do
4678725 i really think that is what has brought so many people to even try it
4678726 i think a long time ago when the dinosaurs roamed a lot of women would be too scared to even try it
4678727 im trying to consciously not put any extra pressure on myself
4678728 i know my parents are already proud of me i guess in my mind i want to perform the best that i can
4678729 that expectation was always there looking over my stats over the last how many years ive been wrestling
4678730 people ask me what is our medal potential and i think it is more than potential
4678731 if we only won one medal i would feel good with that but id also have to say it would be a little disappointing because i know there is potential from all four of our athletes to be on the podium

4678740 the russians were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity
4678741 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
4678742 i think that they had an opportunity to make some very broad points to these nations and i think the russians seized that opportunity
4678743 my guess is that everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead
4678744 i think russias got some serious work to do to try and work its way back into the family of nations that are trying to work together and build democracy and build their economies working together

4678755 i really wanted to have the opportunity to give this film a good review however the actors simply forbade me from doing so
4678756 the rumors are there because people really wish it would happen
4678757 those rumors are just rumors and i dont think theyre going to stop no matter how many times i say no its not happening because somebody will say he said yes his eyes said yes his nose said yes there was a yes iness about him because people want it
4678758 oh i would love to go back and do another serenity movie
4678759 that experience for me was the best acting experience of my life i had never really worked before and we were truly like a family it was an amazing and fun time for all of us i feel so blessed that we got to do the film at all
4678760 sure we could pay a few million for the rights and set another series in a rich diverse exciting universe and get joss to produce
4678761 but then we couldnt make megasnake 2 death of sci fi and fans would kill us
4678762 wed love to do it but no studios are calling
4678763 oh my god joss said yes nine times in that paragraph gotta mean something is in the works
4678764 could sci fi be using such a method to capture an audience for wrestling from a group of sci fi geeks who would normally click off the channel at the end of eureka

4678766 i worked as a waitress in high school that was the last time i had a real world job
4678767 im lucky that i can do art full time even though im not making money from it its an uphill battle thats what i always say
4678768 ive always been drawing and writing stories ever since i was little i always knew i would end up doing something with art in my life
4678769 i was interested in all kinds of art at first i even went into fashion design for a while but when i first saw sailor moon i was hooked i decided to go completely into manga
4678770 manga opened up a new world for me ive always been drawing and writing stories and when i found manga it felt like i found the perfect medium to do both
4678771 i can work with all sorts of mediums thanks to art school i tend to favor using watercolors because i like the feeling of how it looks
4678772 i used to like acrylics but watercolor can look just as good and doesnt take as much time with acrylics i feel like im getting tired or bored sometimes
4678773 i use the software program painter sometimes but i usually stick to watercolors
4678774 i couldnt decide what works to pick because i think i am in a transitional period

4678826 seems weve sung lifes last song poor john so gt long
4678827 nach einem schlechten start ins turnier haben wir uns von spiel zu spiel gesteigert besonders unser lucky looser match hat uns nach vorne gebracht
4678828 wenn wir so spielen ist es f r jeden schwer uns zu schlagen
4678829 ich war mir wirklich erst nach dem letzten punkt sicher dass wir das heute gewinnen werden
4678830 ich kann es nicht fassen dass wir noch gewonnen haben
4678831 but when we come down here we rarely see people we know yall need to come out
4678832 obviously more of this water will be traversable in more parts of the year so we want to find it before hollywood
4678833 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4678834 for the first time in over 160 years i feel that the witnesses of the franklin tragedy events have a chance to really contribute to an important search party

4678839 our father upon his death instructed us to divide his 17 camels as follows
4678840 we have been to school and learned that 17 is a prime number that is divisible only by one and itself and cannot be divided by two or three or nine since we love our camels we cannot divide them exactly
4678841 go ahead have my camel and divide the 18 camels amongst yourselves

4678848 ik kan iets wat bijna niemand kan rechtdoor zoenen omdat mijn neus in zijn geheel bestaat uit kraakbeen kan ik m indrukken als een plastic bekertje met een kreukelzone ik hoef dus nooit een kwartslag te draaien alvorens iemand binnen te doen ik ga gewoon immer gerade aus en daarmee ben ik de trotse bezitter van de andere zoen
4678849 de pubertongzoen zit tussen de oren en alleen om die reden beginnen we eraan als het om de tong zelf zou gaan zou een twaalfjarige die nog geen koffie en olijven lust er no way aan beginnen twaalfjarigen zijn nog erg van het ulg da lussiknie en een tong komt zeker in aanmerking voor die kwalificatie
4678850 het aardige van de relatieruzie als schouwspel is dat er voor de hoofdrolspelers geen ontkomen aan is op het eerste gezicht lijkt er een ontsnappingsmogelijkheid want je hebt namelijk tw opties f je bent degene die in geval van ruzie schaamteloos door het restaurant met pianomuziek brult f je bent degene die met gebogen hoofd op pedagogische fluistertoon de ander tot bedaren brengt als je beiden de tweede mogelijkheid kiest is er niets aan de hand zo met twee volwassenen onder elkaar
4678851 en waar het overdag al een hele heisa kan zijn om dat ne plekje te vinden waar je overeenstemming kunt bereiken s nachts is de grote boeman van ik begrijp niks van jou en ik flip daarvan nog veel prominenter aanwezig dan is het een kwestie van kiezen tussen enerzijds het schemerpad van isolatie gevolgd door een dikke snurk en anderzijds de donkere wolken van verdomme dit gaan we tot het bot uitvechten niet zelden volgt dan de voetbalwedstrijd van fc dramaqueen tegen vv laat me met rust
4678852 vaak met een fiets in de hand een sleutel zojuist teruggekregen brandend in mn zak en de blik gericht op een wazige toekomst van oneindig verdriet de uitmaakzoen is het toppunt van drama geen afscheidsbrief geen groet geen verhuizing kan tippen aan de emotie die je overstroomt als je je geliefde voor het laatst op de mond zoent dit was het dan in duizend zenuwbanen gegraveerd

4678859 over the last five years we have established a reputation for presenting fully functional feasible concept cars and the v12 vantage rs is no exception
4678860 with our dedicated production facilities our own engine plant our own unique vehicle architecture and now a dedicated design studio we have the ideal framework to bring new models such as this to market and to further establish aston martin as the ultimate independent luxury sports car company
4678861 much of aston martins recent success has come from the ability of our designers and engineers to work hand in hand to optimise form and function our new dedicated design centre will take this process to a new level and i am delighted that the v12 vantage rs is the first car to stand on the turntable in the studio

4678897 i wish it could have gone some other way but these are the consequences of my actions
4678898 by praying i place in the hands of the lord the ministry he himself has entrusted me with and the fate of the entire church and civil community
4678899 truly many people write asking me to pray for them they share their joys but also their worries the plans for their lives but also the problems of their families and their work the expectations and hopes that they carry in their hearts together with the distress connected with the uncertainties which humanity is experiencing at this moment
4678900 i know well that the first service i can render to the church and to humanity is precisely that of prayer
4678901 one who prays never loses hope even when he finds himself in difficult or even humanly desperate situations
4678902 both ended their earthly lives with martyrdom in the auschwitz camp

4678940 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4678941 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world

4678990 all companies from major group to independent family concern point out that there is no market failure to justify state funded intervention into the regional and local media that the bbc would be merely replicating local news and related online services already provided by commercial local media and that the impact of such intervention would be hugely damaging to the local media sector at a critical time in its digital development thwarting the deeper broader and richer services which they would provide to their communities

4679022 pero no es una prueba que vayamos a aplicar nosotros tenemos que llegar a un acuerdo adem s hay una nueva administraci n y tenemos que ver la decisi n del rector jos narro
4679023 nos importan mucho las evaluaciones las defendemos y participamos en ellas por ejemplo con copaes y cies en la evaluaci n de las licenciaturas y con el conacyt en el posgrado

4679031 enorme fragmentaci n donde pocos j venes conviven con j venes distintos a ellos y esto produce actitudes de poca tolerancia

4679034 clara tendencia hacia la intolerancia en nuestros j venes quiere decir que la formaci n en valores como el respeto y la tolerancia apenas se est tomando en cuenta pero es una tarea que corresponde tanto a la sociedad padres y maestros como a los propios j venes
4679035 positivo tener los resultados de una encuesta sobre esta problem tica debemos tener muchos m s datos y a lo largo de un tiempo m s prolongado para tener mayor certeza en las conclusiones aunque no podemos sorprendernos de que nuestros j venes sean intolerantes si viven una sociedad profundamente intolerante homof bica y racista

4679234 gerhartsreiter is at the center of the longest con ive ever seen in my professional career
4679235 as prosecutors we need more than a photo and a fading memory to walk into court and amend a complaint
4679236 the fbis fingerprint technicians brought science to bear where mere suspicion had prevailed
4679237 it was the most ridiculous press conference ever the familys already identified him
4679238 now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see
4679239 we believe this offers a framework that would be win win
4679240 that allows us to close the business side of the deal and meets the needs of the public
4679241 i think it is the height of arrogance to think you can pressure federal regulators to approve the deal before theyve done their jobs
4679242 i think theres a presumption that the railroad will be given a chance to make the merger work
4679243 it may come at a higher price for the shareholders
4679244 its clear kilpatrick knew who detective white was he had previous contact with him through his other case he specifically called him by name in this case
4679245 you should be ashamed of yourself being with a man with the last name white you should not be a part of this
4679246 change the header to assault on a police officer and fondling
4679247 this was very stressful to me personally i was under a lot of stress my way of alleviating stress is to make light of things
4679248 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4679249 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4679250 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4679251 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4679252 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4679253 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4679254 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4679255 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4679256 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4679257 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4679258 we get by with a little help from our friends
4679259 success and prosperity are spiritual attributes belonging to all people but not necessarily used by all people
4679260 we get by with a little help from our friends
4679261 fantacy hole they had frickin small holes in the wall use your imagination im not sayin it lol there was a local preacher man that just happen to be in there at the time of the bust
4679262 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
4679263 come across as somebody who is prepared to use military action
4679264 see in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda
4679265 america was never innocent we popped our cherry on the boat over and looked back with no regrets you cant ascribe our fall from grace to any single event or set of circumstances you cant lose what you lacked at conception
4679266 mass market nostalgia gets you hopped up for a past that never existed hagiography sanctifies shuck and jive politicians and reinvents their expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight our continuing narrative line is blurred past truth and hindsight only a reckless verisimilitude can set that line straight
4679267 how can you afford to share your best seed corn with your neighbours when they are entering corn in competition with yours each year
4679268 didnt you know the wind picks up pollen from the ripening corn and swirls it from field to field if my neighbours grow inferior sub standard and poor quality corn cross pollination will steadily degrade the quality of my corn if i am to grow good corn i must help my neighbours grow good corn
4679269 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4679270 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4679271 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4679272 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4679273 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4679274 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4679275 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4679276 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4679277 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4679278 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4679279 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4679280 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4679281 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4679282 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4679283 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4679284 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4679285 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4679286 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4679287 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4679288 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4679289 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4679290 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4679291 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4679292 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4679293 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4679294 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4679295 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4679296 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4679297 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4679298 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4679299 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4679300 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4679301 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4679302 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4679303 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4679304 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4679305 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4679306 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4679307 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4679308 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4679309 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4679310 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4679311 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4679312 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4679313 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4679314 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4679315 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4679316 who are open to doing something on the production side
4679317 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4679318 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4679319 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4679320 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4679321 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4679322 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4679323 if anyone would have said before the games that id win two golds and break the world record id have laughed in their face i never thought it
4679324 i knew when i touched the wall i was going to win the gold but i didnt expect to get the record and by that much its unbelievable
4679325 its always been a goal of mine to do this i never really expected i could do it at this moment in time but its always been in the back of my mind olympic games everyone raises the bar i cant believe what happened im so happy it wasnt like the 400 i knew id won
4679326 i feel like theres still n ggas that owe me checks i feel like theres still bitches that owe me sex
4679327 i met this girl when i was three years old and what i love most she had so much soul
4679328 have you ever popped champagne on a plane while gettin brain i whipped it out she said i never seen snakes on a plane
4679329 when he get on he gon leave yo ass for a white girl
4679330 oh my dear simple stephen once upon a time you wished to see me alive
4679331 youre just a character just a character from some silly novel i was writing g get b back where you belong
4679332 very well stephen but you created me you know pray tell me you know i wont go back despite your pathetic pleadings
4679333 i dont do anything unless i see a gain stephen and leaving you alone well lets just say theres little to be gained
4679334 but im curious when did i ever say that youre of no use to
4679335 id never have blown so much money like that anyway you know what id do dont you
4679336 you know the color red is just so very fascinating funny when you created me you neglect to give me a lifeline odd isnt it
4679337 look james please ill give you anything you want just leave me ok please
4679338 but its your landlady she was found murdered inside her home last night
4679339 oh oh my god how how can i help you officers
4679340 well sir would you mind if we ask a few questions
4679341 err the house is in a mess would you gentlemen mind if we stay out here and chat
4679342 uh ok well for starters sir your landlady seems to have no record of you or your name
4679343 im a writer you see i like my privacy my name is james henry porter but i go by the pen name of stephen
4679344 in the flesh mr stephen im im a big fan of your books sir
4679345 oh come now stephen dont be such a cry baby
4679346 do you mind if i take a seat beside you
4679347 i have absolutely no need of you anymore ive fed on you long enough to carve out my own path
4679348 the march 14 incident had the biggest impact on the service sector in tibet and the tourism industry was significantly impacted
4679349 we inherit from our ancestors gifts so often taken for granted each of us contains within this inheritance of soul we are links between the ages containing past and present expectations sacred memories and future promises
4679350 the tours 22 national stops and more than 150 000 in cash and prizes make this one of the most exciting summers in our 18 years
4679351 i sang it once just one take and vowed i would never sing it again it just wasnt my style
4679352 this is one of the biggest fines that has ever been handed to a restaurant owner in the city the size of the fine represents how seriously these offences are treated
4679353 keeping a restaurant in such a filthy vermin infested state shows a wanton disregard for the health of the manchester residents and visitors to the city who eat there and this fine should send out a clear message that this sort of practice will not be tolerated and restaurant owners will be prosecuted
4679354 this is about dealing with the issues that are having an impact on the lives of people in greater manchester
4679355 i dont want to detract from the great work thats taking place
4679356 dealing with firearms is an area where theres remarkable performance
4679357 but i need to have confidence and we ask that an action plan is brought to this authority on september 5 weve got our eye on this and that we are determined to get it right
4679358 we saw the lanterns coming out of a garden off bradfield road at about half six there was a group of three lads letting them off and three more riding on bikes to see how far they were going they were laughing at all the people staring
4679359 there are usually between 80 and 90 sightings a year and the vast majority of them are these lanterns or balloons they only cost around 3 and can be set off within minutes of being bought
4679360 its very hard to judge how big something is in the sky because there is nothing to compare things with
4679361 as for the disappearing the lantern more than likely just went behind low cloud cover rather than vanish into thin air
4679362 ive been thinking about this for three or four years and coming to the exhibition has finally given me the push to donate my body
4679363 im a science student myself and i think its important to educate both the medical profession and the general public
4679364 im not religious my family thought it was just a whim but when i told them i had put my body forward for donation they were fine about it
4679365 this is the only chance that most people will get to have a look at what the human body is like on the inside hopefully it will give them a sense of their own mortality and theyll go away and look after themselves better this show is a celebration of life rather than death
4679366 i want to do this to help future generations out with medical research
4679367 i personally think it all begins with the children someone ought to rewrite those fairy tales well you know show hansel and gretel for what they really are a couple of pushy kids going around eating sweet old ladies houses
4679368 its quite an honour for us to have him on our wall
4679369 he won a military cross and there are few people who won this in the community its given to people whose careers went above and beyond the call of duty he saved the lives of his comrades
4679370 it brought back a lot of vivid memories for me when i was putting this together
4679371 here dorothy thisll make you feel better she wiped the back of her hand across her brow and blinked several times to bring the world into bleary focus
4679372 one of the worlds oldest largest longest and maddest football games
4679373 you can get everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want
4679374 what does it take to create a client for life
4679375 wait and see ill wait and see till she sends for me sends for me
4679376 first time ive played in a game in 55 years not having one of your tailbacks able to play
4679377 its the first time ive played in a game in 55 years not
4679378 this has to be the worst game ive played in the last 5 years
4679379 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4679380 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4679381 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4679382 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4679383 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4679384 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4679385 whats the worst thing that could happen if we waited and didnt go in and whats the worst thing that could happen if we did go in and things went horribly wrong
4679386 he said he was going to make the kids breakfast feed the kids and then after he fed the kids he was going to kill the kids and himself to go be with his wife
4679387 in law enforcement if somebody shoots at you your general instinct is to fire back
4679388 again to the officers credit they showed a great deal of restraint and discipline because to put a round back towards the suspect youve gotta know where is that bullet going to go
4679389 the officers train hard they take their jobs very seriously and they know what their mission is
4679390 but to say that there wasnt a little bit of luck involved in that absolutely but anytime we can get some luck to go our way well take it
4679391 i was always coming back unless i was a top round pick or something like that
4679392 we won the north and were ranked no 1 in the nation but we lost in the big 12 championship game we want to fix that
4679393 definitely last year set the foundation for what were trying to do this year
4679394 it was exciting last year it was a once in a lifetime season and were trying to do it again this year
4679395 you look at a team and quarterbacks are judged one thing and thats wins
4679396 it doesnt matter about the heisman or anything the only thing that is important to me is to go out there and be the best i can for our team
4679397 football is the greatest team sport there has ever been except for one position
4679398 we all know at the quarterback position that guy has got to be special if you want to win that guy has got to be a difference maker type player if you want to win a big 12 championship or go on to the bcs
4679399 when a quarterback plays at the level that chase does it increases your chances of winning he had good people around him a year ago and hes got good people around him this year we all know one guy wont be the difference at this level but if you want to win championships you need a guy who can take it to another level and chase does that for us
4679400 i didnt think it would happen last year i thought it would happen this year when we got everything ready
4679401 it happened kind of fast but i knew we were going to be good we did it a little faster than i thought we would
4679402 wait i will make him a little smaller for you
4679403 it has absolutely been the best received new program ive ever seen
4679404 its a planning tool that allows people to plan forward on a major investment
4679405 its a fixed rate like budget billing for utilities you know what the cost is going to be the bulk of the cost over the next four years which is pretty much unprecedented
4679406 it works out great to know exactly for four years what your payments are going to be
4679407 we have one at k state and it doesnt get locked in so each year you just kind of wonder what youre going to pay
4679408 it was completely unpredictable the way the timing works out now
4679409 the regents rule on tuition for the coming year in june and that gives you to the end of june july and august to have a new plan thats hard to plan
4679410 a lot more work on our end but we think its worth it to provide stability
4679411 gas is one little example of all the unknown factors we have to look at
4679412 but that is part of the risk ku assumes when they ask the board to set the compact tuition rate each year
4679413 i think it is a challenge to not get the compact tuition rate too high in the process of trying to predict four years into the future
4679414 the neighborhood people know they can call me any time day or night
4679415 it doesnt always mean i can solve the problem but i will jump on it
4679416 before that agreement between the city and university i dont think we would have had many calls from the chancellors office to have lunch
4679417 we believe the agreement with the city has worked very well for all concerned
4679418 it has opened regular lines of communication and it has made very clear what the responsibilities are of the university
4679419 my observation is that alcohol related behavior by students has gotten worse in the neighborhood
4679420 what has led to those extreme measures at some other universities are problems that weve been blessed not to have
4679421 in all honesty my parents had no idea what to expect and what to do when it came to enrollment
4679422 we want to think about how we can work with communities to make sure parents are looking at ways to encourage them
4679423 as the student population changes ku needs to be changing and responding in ways to meet their needs
4679424 that is what we are doing this summer looking at applications admittance and enrollment and determining where we need to go in the future
4679425 we continue to evaluate each year next year we are looking to expand our recruitment efforts
4679426 this u s model of a child becoming independent when they graduate from high school and leaving home is not part of their cultural expectations
4679427 i was overwhelmed as it was and i didnt have a problem with the language barrier
4679428 with students who are trying to process the information that they are getting and at the same time repeat it to their parents a lot of things are missed or not conveyed
4679429 i spend so much time because im passionate and im competitive
4679430 i really like to win and debate is not really one of those things that you can go halfway at and still be really successful youve got to put your whole self into it
4679431 for an athlete maybe its a 6 a m run but for us its getting up and immediately starting to research
4679432 we spend as many if not more hours than any collegiate athlete just doing things to prepare
4679433 three or four students wanted to come to ku but they were getting offers from other less successful programs that included substantial scholarship money that we just cant match
4679434 we dont have any substantial scholarship money and very limited money for anyone coming out of state which is really hampering the recruiting process for ku
4679435 it should show you that the kids who are willing to be part of this activity even without scholarships love it and want to be here and its something that means a lot to them
4679436 its the love for competition that moment where its just you your opponent and the judge in the back of the room
4679437 for an hour and half thats all that matters in the world the competition that feeling of giving everything you have its powerful feeling one that keeps people coming back year after year after year and its one when i finish my time in debate that i will miss greatly
4679438 all of us are a pretty tight circle of friends so all of us always hang out on the weekends go out together things like that
4679439 i think thats like any other team people see the basketball team out together were out there too
4679440 we share each others victories and we are saddened by each others defeats
4679441 we really do everything we can to help each other out during the tournament
4679442 its not that we ever expect to have hoards of cheering fans like the basketball team but we really appreciate the respect that weve been shown
4679443 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4679444 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4679445 most of it has been recovered its interesting being attached to the history of the place
4679446 the structure has a significant role in honoring mrs watkins
4679447 its continued use honors her legacy to the university which goes well beyond this one building
4679448 sometimes people say to me well students are always walking around in your driveway back and forth to class and i say i think thats fun
4679449 i get a chance to say hello to some students and greet them as theyre going to class
4679450 i like being at the center of activity on campus
4679451 i like to see all of the kids and were close enough that bob can walk to work and we can walk to the games
4679452 basketballs great footballs great its a lot of fun and i love it
4679453 we really believe that the house is owned by the state of kansas so we try as much as possible to share it with students and the faculty and staff
4679454 we do a lot of entertaining and encourage people to come and be part of events at our house
4679455 anyone whos graduating can come by and have a box lunch and get their picture taken at the outlook and get their picture taken with the chancellor and thats usually very well attended
4679456 it gave them an appreciation for the campus and they loved being near everything
4679457 when the kids got older one of them stayed in the basement
4679458 and one of our sons has a dog so thats why thats there
4679459 i think its a great privilege to be able to live here and i know that my wife and children do too
4679460 the shortages become more and more critical over the next few years
4679461 students look for ways to make a larger campus seem smaller and these unique little 50 person buildings certainly do that
4679462 many students are drawn to the idea of the cooperative house
4679463 theyll provide the leadership to the incoming students in the fall
4679464 i think its going to be really cool to start traditions
4679465 you can look around the campus and see all the construction going on as a pretty good metaphor for all thats going on in ku
4679466 i think it will be a very effective way to challenge the campus to think seriously about what it means to be a graduate of the university of kansas
4679467 its something everyone in the state is going to have to deal with
4679468 you dont judge yourself against the longevity of the other universities
4679469 you judge yourself if youre being effective and successful as a chancellor
4679470 ive had the opportunity because i grew up in nebraska to observe what a great university ku was when they called me and said they were interested in having me interview for the job at ku i felt really good about the possibility and the interview went well the rest is history
4679471 i intend to stay as long as im effective as long as im successful as long as im active
4679472 the board of regents are my boss theyre the people who decide if im being successful active and effective any plans i would have would have to fit with the board of regents plans
4679473 its being renovated to serve the purpose of why it was originally built
4679474 if you sit out here during regular semesters theres a lot of traffic
4679475 its my hope to have the kiosk open when campus is most active
4679476 youll be able to ask the same kinds of questions as in the kansas union
4679477 blogging has an oppositional psyche to it so the left were feeling their opposition and wanted to say something
4679478 it could be that when blogging gained popularity more conservatives were in power
4679479 i never imagined we would or could go back to the days of individual production of mass media products
4679480 a blog is kind of like a neo pet a virtual pet that needs constant special care you have to feed it every day or it dies
4679481 if you actually build an audience your audience expects you to post every day maybe a couple times a day maybe even many times a day
4679482 the blogging world is so interesting practically every week i find something new
4679483 when i was growing up if you disagreed with something someone wrote in a column you wrote a letter to the editor or if you were really aggressive you called the columnist
4679484 with blogging you get an instant response you may get 100 people attacking you or praising you within 20 minutes
4679485 when everyone has access to the web you get some really interesting experts somebody writing a comment on the post about the surge in iraq may very well be a major in the war in iraq
4679486 thats one of the reasons i dont politically blog anymore
4679487 i didnt like being attacked by a hundred people instantly
4679488 its very difficult to be attacked and thats part of blogging
4679489 david perlmutter is not johnny carson hes an academic and its almost a mismatch to put him on that kind of show that having been said i thought he did very very well
4679490 he even made a joke it was a fabulous appearance and i was very proud of him
4679491 but its not unlike people and their retirement funds its all relative
4679492 we just have to work harder and smarter and look for new opportunities to present to donors for them to partner with us and the university to do something they want to achieve
4679493 the university of kansas is a great product and attracts peoples interests for investment whether its to help students or initiate arts programs or address health care related issues whatever that may be
4679494 it will be a comprehensive campaign that involves every school and academic program at the university and will involve the core areas of student support facilities faculty salaries and no doubt outreach how the university serves kansas and its communities
4679495 and we try to mitigate as much as possible the downturns
4679496 we have an obligation and always have an obligation to carry out the wishes of the donors
4679497 we first and foremost stay committed to that meeting the donors wishes
4679498 theres a great sense of pride and feeling about the university and that can certainly contribute to people making a decision on a major gift at a later date
4679499 the conversations are much longer and there is a lot more excitement and interest when they reach alumni whether its here in kansas or across the country
4679500 this is running counter to the economy so we think certainly some of the good things that are happening at the university are contributing to keeping this on the positive side
4679501 there has been a tremendous amount of purchasing activity so we would envision that the licensing revenue that we accrue this year will definitely show an increase from last year and the year before
4679502 in terms of a national championship in basketball theres a possibility that ku may be the best national champions in terms of sales ever by any school that theyve represented
4679503 obviously athletic success drives an awful lot of business and that has certainly been the case here with ku
4679504 i never once went into an ncaa tournament thinking im not going to approve any final four
4679505 there seems to be a continued emphasis on youth apparel theres more of an emphasis on tailgating apparel
4679506 overall we have seen an increase of interest in the university of kansas in terms of students wanting more information and visits to campus
4679507 thats definitely significant but there are more factors than just athletics to take into consideration
4679508 we are hoping that that interest continues for the seniors coming up
4679509 theyre very excited in general about what the university can offer them
4679510 the golden rule is are they genuine if theyre just coming in to get on tv im not interested just kick them out straight away
4679511 im not going to put people on who just dress up as a banana im not going to do it so everyone you see good or bad is sincere
4679512 i just dont want to think about it right now
4679513 the vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the governments business
4679514 i dont think it is the governments business to tell you how to spend your leisure time
4679515 smoked marijuana has not withstood the rigors of science it is not medicine and it is not safe
4679516 legalization of marijuana no matter how it begins will come at the expense of our children and public safety it will create dependency and treatment issues and open the door to use of other drugs impaired health delinquent behavior and drugged drivers
4679517 a phony war on drugs that is filling up our prisons especially with people of color
4679518 is one of the most destructive criminal justice policies in america today
4679519 i smoke cigars i dont think other people should do that if young people ask me i would advise them not to do it
4679520 urusan usaha anda serahkan pada kami kami siap membantu anda
4679521 i thought in the perfect circumstances i could do it
4679522 ive always marveled at the fact that in the last four years he has had to live with a lot more expectations and anxiety that i had to deal with
4679523 it is within her right to verify the elections results we remain confident that our campaign is on the path to victory in november
4679524 i have received encouragement to pursue the re count from an overwhelming number of democratic primary voters
4679525 is my order going to be made after all these other orders are bagged up and served to go

4679528 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4679529 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4679530 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4679531 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4679532 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4679533 ako ahko m e by ukrajina proti svojej v li zatiahnut do medzin rodn ho konfliktu
4679534 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4679535 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4679536 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4679537 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4679538 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4679539 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4679540 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4679541 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4679542 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4679543 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4679544 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4679545 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4679546 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4679547 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

4679549 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4679550 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4679551 i certainly hope that its not dying because that would be bad for all of us for society and for our communities but its changing its in a huge upheaval period
4679552 its a surprise that its taken this long to hit des moines and the register
4679553 i go online and look at the daily news that comes up
4679554 one of the things i enjoy most is at the end of the day getting my paper laying back in my bed and physically having a piece of paper in my hand and reading it

4679564 we asked if she wanted to play again that evening for another 50 she told us to get stuffed she didnt even turn around
4679565 she was feisty and outspoken i think thats genuinely how she is manchester did not get a different madonna
4679566 she had a very jaundiced view of manchester at the time that was probably about right
4679567 we still do not know exactly what happened to my brother and we probably never will i cant believe that my brother will never come home again
4679568 as a family we are so terribly proud of ben to me he is like an olympic gold medal winner he had the most amazing drive and determination for everything he did and was achieving what most of us mere mortals would never have dreamed of
4679569 we only wish that he had been more aware of the dangers he was facing ben had not himself been exposed first hand to the devastating consequences of avalanches unlike some of his older team mates i just wish i could have warned my little brother
4679570 the remote possibility is that ben had been caught in a crevasse or hidden in a snowhole however he had only taken enough food water and gas for four to five days and it is now impossible that he could have survived at such an altitude
4679571 it is tragic that ben has met his fate in the same way
4679572 ben was the cheekiest of the cheeks it is impossible to fill the gap that he has left in our lives he was a talented drummer from the age of eight a skilled road racing cyclist traveller fire juggler and a world class climber but most importantly he was a wonderful friend to so many people who have told us that they will never forget him
4679573 on the last tour they played to nearly 200 000 people in manchester and the shows were amazing this is the first leg of a very long tour
4679574 i am sure they must have a surprise for manchester
4679575 there were only a couple of pallets left when it darted out really fast it was a bit of a shock and i got a fright because its not what you expect i was gob smacked
4679576 it must have been in there for four or five days so im surprised that it survived
4679577 it was quite scared and had nothing to eat or drink for days so we went out to get some food it mewed a lot and because he was from italy we were saying ciao bello
4679578 it made quite an impact on everyone and we wanted to make sure it would be okay
4679579 obviously he was very nervous at the time he was quite dirty and very hungry and thirsty
4679580 but he has turned out to be a really nice cat
4679581 the bbc is in talks to introduce a whole series

4679587 izabella is a real little cracker she eats anything and everything now and the transformation is amazing
4679588 she was tiny and very delicate it was very worrying
4679589 but she used to fidget around in the incubator and she was obviously very strong
4679590 a ventilator was helping her to breathe but she was only on it for a day and the doctors were all amazed at that she was also fed through a tube
4679591 we were really pleased when she came home and all our initial fears are now over she has done really well in the year and has only needed two hospital check ups she has piled the weight on
4679592 she is doing amazing now crawling around gurgling and laughing
4679593 she is still very petite but it looks like she is going to grow up to be quite tall
4679594 we are going to have a special party today for her and all the family are really pleased
4679595 not only have we been able to conceive and have a baby in the time its already taken them but the chances are that our daughter lucy grace could well have a little brother or sister before we get our meter
4679596 the whole six months went by without any contact from united utilities we made numerous calls to them early this year to find out what the results of the monitoring exercise were only to find we had just wasted our time
4679597 my wife was told on one occasion they didnt even know who the meter belonged to they would have to send out an inspector to check and we would have to wait another couple of months to be told anything further
4679598 i contacted them in june when i had to explain the whole saga over again and still nothing was done
4679599 the last time i rang i was told the previous person i had spoken to was off sick but have since found out they have left the company
4679600 i was promised compensation for every day we had been without a water meter but united utilities have just kept fobbing us off
4679601 we are both extremely angry and frustrated at their lack of communication and sheer incompetence
4679602 we wish to apologise to mr rolfe over the delay in getting his meter fitted
4679603 the strength of feeling over the way the council has handled this review was clear workers turned out in force and were determined to make their voices heard they wanted to voice their disgust that some salaries will drop by as much as 7 500

4679619 whether its in the university or anywhere else we all want ubiquitous wireless wherever we go
4679620 the progress weve made in the last two years in expanding our coverage in the academic areas is really due to the leadership of the students and their willingness to partner with the university on this
4679621 i think its a good thing thats where everything is headed more and more people have laptops and take notes on them
4679622 im never in a building where im too far away from the union

4679626 one of the things weve looked at is whether having in the dormitory areas is a priority

4679661 i think that people will be pleasantly surprised that the building does nothing to diminish the view of the stadium from the hill
4679662 chancellor bob hemenway told me we dont want to ruin the traditional image of campanile hill
4679663 that was on purpose we didnt want to match that
4679664 its helped the hill made it a lot nicer and made it a lot better for commencement for football for everything
4679665 i dont feel like the complex detracts from the natural beauty of the hill it seems to blend i wouldnt say seamlessly in an understated way
4679666 the university also has established protocols to use local media to help inform the public in the event of an ongoing crisis

4679758 als ich mit meinem stab am nachmittag mein stabsquartier in schitomir bezogen hatte h rten wir in regelm igen abst nden gewehrsalven denen pistolensch sse folgten nach einiger zeit sahen wir zahlreiche soldaten und zivilpersonen einem vor uns liegenden bahndamm zustr men als wir schlie lich den bahndamm erklettert hatten bot sich ein bild dessen grausame abscheulichkeit auf den unvorbereitet herantretenden ersch tternd und abschreckend wirkte in die erde war ein etwa 7 8 meter langer vielleicht 4 meter breiter graben eingezogen die grube selbst war mit zahlreichen leichen aller art und jeden geschlechts gef llt hinter dem wall stand ein kommando polizei die uniformen wiesen blutspuren auf im weiten umkreis standen unz hlige soldaten teilweise in badehose als zuschauer unter anderem lag in diesem graben ein alter mann mit wei em vollbart der ber seinem arm noch ein spazierst ckchen h ngen hatte da dieser mann lebenszeichen von sich gab ersuchte ich einen polizisten ihn endg ltig zu t ten worauf dieser mit lachender miene sagte dem habe ich schon siebenmal in den bauch geschossen der krepiert schon von alleine
4679759 dieser krieg ist ein rassenkrieg er ist vom judentum ausgegangen und verfolgt kein anderes ziel als die vernichtung und ausrottung unseres volkes
4679760 je eher die juden vernichtet werden desto besser ist es f r die welt
4679761 das ergebnis f r unser volk muss die restlose ausschaltung der juden sein m gen diese dinge schrecklich sein sie sind unausweichlich
4679762 der vollstreckungsbefehl ist gegeben und unwiderruflich die exekution ist bereits im vollen gang
4679763 damit spricht das gericht der schaffenden menschheit das todesurteil gegen das j dische verbrechervolk und rottet es so aus wie es anderen v lkern ans leben wollte mit m nnern weibern und kindern damit die welt von ihm erl st wird und ruhe findet und den ersehnten langen langen frieden
4679764 in meinem amtsbezirk geht schon seit monaten das ger cht dass geistes und k rperschwache anstaltspfleglinge planm ig beseitigt w rden unausbleiblich erscheint es mir dass das vertrauen zur staatsf hrung in weitesten bev lkerungskreisen furchtbar ersch ttert wird
4679765 die exekution der libauer juden bildet noch immer das gespr chsthema der hiesigen bev lkerung vielfach wird das los der juden bedauert und es sind zun chst wenig positive stimmen zur beseitigung der juden zu h ren es ist zu erwarten dass ber die erfolgte regelung der judenfrage in libau demn chst wieder beruhigung eintreten wird
4679766 im sommer 1943 war der mord an den juden f r die allermeisten deutschen zur tatsache geworden zu offen propagierten die ns medien die vernichtungspolitik der m rderische charakter der antisemitischen politik war angesichts der sich verdichtenden ger chte ber das grauenhafte schicksal j discher m nner frauen und kinder immer schwieriger zu bezweifeln
4679767 unsere sorge muss es sein das instinktm ige gegen das judentum in unseren volk zu wecken und aufzupeitschen und aufzuwiegeln solange bis es zum entschluss kommt der bewegung sich anzuschlie en die bereit ist die konsequenzen daraus zu ziehen

4679772 die medien sind so berw ltigend pro israelisch da die meisten menschen nicht auf die idee kommen ihre unterst tzung f r eine bewegung zum ausdruck zu bringen die mutig versucht eine koloniale milit rbesatzung zu beenden die meisten leute wissen kaum etwas ber die geschichte oder die geografische topografie die f r diesen konflikt wichtig sind und so sagen sie dann nun ja die araber und juden haben wieder einmal ihren ewigen streit wobei sie von der vorstellung ausgehen hier gebe es zwei gleich starke seiten deren eine die israelische st ndig belagert und angegriffen wird auch hier in den vereinigten staaten haben wir eine form der zensur n mlich die der marginalisierung bei der kritiker in den mainstream medien einfach nicht vorkommen
4679773 eine us amerikanische zeitung h tte dieses interview niemals abgedruckt und zwar einfach deshalb weil das gesamte thema pal stina in den vereinigten staaten so gut wie tabu ist und nur als nebenaspekt eines nebenaspektes eines nebenaspektes behandelt werden kann das ist das prinzip das sich etliche der j dischen organisationen in den usa zur maxime gemacht haben
4679774 es handelt sich um ein jahrhundertealtes bild vom islam und von den arabern das keine differenzierungen macht
4679775 es ist obsz n wenn juden ganz gleich ob sie israelis oder amerikaner sind den pal stinensern heute sagen
4679776 16 november 2005 warum f llt es mir heute so schwer etwas zu papier zu bringen ich bin weder in gaza noch in ramallah sondern in meinem alten wohnviertel in tel aviv beobachte die belebte stra e die schicke n boutiquen ich komme gerade aus einer anderen welt gerade noch stand ich vor einem israelischen gef ngnis wohin ich einen freund begleitet hatte ist es dieser kontrast der jeden kommentar berfl ig macht ich bemerkte die palmen vor dem gef ngnis b ume die die gefangenen nicht sehen k nnen meine tr nen haben sich zu einem schmerzhaften knoten in meiner brust verh rtet
4679777 9 februar 2001 einer meiner freunde lebt in silwad dreizehn autominuten von meiner wohnung in ramallah entfernt das dorf stand f nf tage lang ohne jede unterbrechung unter ausgangssperre weil ein paar unbekannte k mpfer sch sse auf ein siedlerauto abgegeben haben eine freundin lebt im fl chtlingslager deheische bei bethlehem die ganze gegend war drei monate lang ein einziger riesiger k fig die hauptstra en waren ausschlie lich den juden vorbehalten das recht auf bewegungsfreiheit wird den pal stinensern nicht erst seit beginn der intifada vor einigen monaten verweigert sondern schon seit 1991 die fahrt von einer ortschaft in eine andere ist nur mit einer israelischen reisegenehmigung m glich

4679779 antisemitismus hat es schon vor der gr ndung des j dischen staates gegeben und er besteht auch weiter unabh ngig von israel f r berzeugte antisemiten kann israelkritik gewi eine der willkommenen gelegenheiten zur manifestation von judenfeindlichkeit sein was man an juden aussetzen zu k nnen glaubt wird potenziert am j dischen staat bem ngelt das hat aber mit kritik nichts zu tun ist vielmehr lediglich die anwendung negativer vorurteile
4679780 das problem ist dabei die vorstellung des globalen komplotts und der heimlichkeit des einflusses nicht aber zwangsl ufig die feststellung des einflusses es ist n mlich nicht antisemitisch wenn man etwa bemerkt da juden gemessen an ihrer zahl einen berproportionalen einflu auf die einzig briggebliebene supermacht haben
4679781 desgleichen werden auch die amerikanische armee oder die franz sische polizei mit ss schergen gleichgesetzt so unangemessen diese vergleiche sind weil sie das bezeichnete berzeichnen und die nationalsozialistischen schandtaten verharmlosen antisemitisch ist das nicht
4679782 es ist als ob wir uns in einem schlechten film befinden in einem jener filme in denen der widersacher uns immer wieder aufs neue angreift immer wieder aufsteht auch wenn wir ihn gerade get tet haben wer kann die welt noch von diesem wahnsinn befreien der die juden und den westen zu vernichten droht
4679783 das symbol vom goldenen kalb kann als antisemitisches stereotyp wirken es mu aber nicht als solches gelesen werden die frage ist immer ob es als solches gemeint ist und auf wen es als solches wirkt das bem hen um eindeutigkeit bleibt einem denken verhaftet das eine 1 1 relation zwischen sprache und wirklichkeit unterstellt damit wird den w rtern etwas aufgeb rdet da sie berhaupt nicht zu leisten imstande sind wahrheiten zu enthalten die objektiv und berall g ltig sind

4679786 hier ging es weniger um taktische und politische auseinandersetzungen als um einen generationenkonflikt eshkol und das kabinett f rchteten die politischen folgen von gro angriffen die armee hingegen war nicht auf verteidigung ausgelegt sondern darauf offensiv vorzugehen die staatsgrenzen seien nicht befestigt und gesichert und zwar aus gutem grund erkl rte moshe dayan im april 1967
4679787 ein jahr zuvor hatte der us amerikanische geheimdienst vorhergesagt dass die pal stinensischen terrorangriffe m glicherweise zu einem krieg f hren w rden in dem fall werde israel die gyptische luftwaffe zerst ren und binnen tagen oder wochen teile des sinai das westjordanland und ostjerusalem sowie die golanh hen besetzen

4679799 f r martin indyk den damaligen us botschafter in tel aviv verstand sich clinton als israels rechtsbeistand der fairness und den willen zur umsetzung von vorschl gen vermissen lie die politische bearbeitung der israelischen und der pal stinensischen ffentlichkeit durch washington unterblieb dagegen sorgte in israel die psychologische kriegsf hrung daf r da f r den fall des scheiterns die verantwortung klargestellt war vor dem treffen wurden berichte gestreut und von den beiden auflagenst rksten israelischen zeitungen aufgenommen wonach israel den besten aller m glichen kompromisse unterbreiten werde w hrend die pal stinensische delegation voraussichtlich dazu neige entscheidungen zu vertagen
4679800 historiographisch ist das urteil ber arafats vermeintliche absichten zwar kaum mehr als eine fu note wert aber international verfehlte sie ihre wirkung nicht
4679801 ob die pal stinensische f hrung am ende nicht mehr und ganz anderes wollte
4679802 die israel zugedachten verpflichtungen lie en sich kaum unverbindlicher formulieren dieser bescheidenheit schlo sich das ausw rtige amt in jerusalem erfreut an es verlangte von den pal stinensern das ende des terrors bevor die vision eines pal stinensischen staates realistisch sei

4679806 recht und gerechtigkeit leben von engagierten und couragierten b rgern das wurde all die jahre meine wichtigste maxime niemals feige sein so wie die generation unserer eltern feige gewesen ist t dlich feige bis zum tod israelis und juden besonders deutsche juden sollten ber jeden deutschen der nicht mehr gewillt ist feige zu sein froh und dankbar sein
4679807 martin buber wie haben sie ihre zeit erlebt was w rden sie sagen wenn sie sehen k nnten da unrat von den wohnungen orthodoxer juden auf die in den engen gassen der altstadt von hebron herumspazierenden pal stinensern ausgeleert wird was w re ihre reaktion wenn sie vor den checkpoints der israelischen armee stehen w rden
4679808 man mu nur einmal durch teile der westbank gefahren sein um selbst zu sehen da dort kein staat errichtet werden kann
4679809 es soll keiner sp ter sagen er habe nicht gewu t was in israel geschieht wer es wissen will hat gen gend m glichkeiten sich zu informieren wer es nicht tut will es nicht wissen
4679810 ich m chte ihnen heute die these vorstellen da zionismus und der staat israel einen unerwarteten bruch in der j dischen geschichte darstellen einen aufstand gegen den j dischen messianismus weiterhin behaupte ich da die anerkennung der spannung zwischen zionismus und messianismus unerl lich ist um die probleme zu verstehen die dem j dischen staat inh rent sind
4679811 der staat der als traum einer sektiererischen minderheit begann entwickelte sich zum lebenswichtigen mittelpunkt des gesamten j dischen volkes doch im grunde genommen waren weder die juden noch die welt darauf vorbereitet die gr ndung eines solchen staates kam nicht nur in der j dischen tradition sondern auch in der christlichen und der muslimischen tradition unerwartet
4679812 die probleme auf die israel nach wie vor bei dem versuch st t sich einen normalen platz unter den nationen zu sichern k nnen nicht nur mit dem aktuellen politischen geschehen erkl rt werden
4679813 ich kenne keinen anderen staat der gegenw rtig nicht nur von arabischen sondern auch von westlichen l ndern so verleumdet wird wie israel das scheinbar ungew hnlich hartn ckige fortbestehen eines j dischen nationalen bewu tseins nach dem verlust des staates ber fast zwei jahrtausende hinweg ist eine tatsache die nicht abgetan sondern vielmehr erstaunen hervorrufen sollte
4679814 die juden haben sich als erfolgreichste ethnische minderheit in bezug auf gleichstellung und sozialen aufstieg erwiesen eine mehrheit der juden kann sich heute mit recht als angeh rige der mittelschicht bezeichnen und stolz auf ihren berragenden beitrag zu kunst wissenschaft bildung medizin journalismus politik und nicht zuletzt handel sein ja es gab leid aber das erz hlt uns nur einen teil der geschichte ber die au erordentliche wirtschaftliche und intellektuelle begabung die sich ber die jahrhunderte entwickelt hat
4679815 die mehrheit der juden lebte bis vor 500 jahren in arabischen l ndern im heutigen israel stammen ber eine million der j dischen b rger aus den muslimischen l ndern des nahen ostens und nordafrikas als auff lliger ma stab nicht nur f r den erfolg der juden sondern auch f r ihren besonderen beitrag zur islamisch arabischen zivilisation jener zeit kann die wirklich beindruckende beteiligung von juden in medizinischen berufen gelten der zionismus hat araber und juden entgegen der langen islamisch arabischen zivilisationsgeschichte auseinander getrieben
4679816 im dritten viertel des 19 jahrhunderts erwirtschaftete pal stina einen riesigen landwirtschaftlichen berschu auf dem weltmarkt wurden weizen gerste sesam oliven l seife und baumwolle verkauft zu diesem zeitpunkt berstiegen die exporte die importe europ ischer fabrikg ter

4679819 this is a nonprofit event and all the proceeds go to local charities and community sports
4679820 we usually have about 100 to 125 people who register on the day of the show
4679821 the idea of this event besides for people to enjoy a great car show is also for them to enjoy our downtown and all of the restaurants and stores we have here in el segundo
4679822 i think we probably have the best cars represented of any car show and to top it off this is a beautiful place to be the weather should be nice and we have great restaurants and great shopping
4679823 its just a good local gathering of people so bring the family down for a good time
4679824 the board really couldnt put off moving forward on these much needed repairs because to do so would just compound the cost and increase the risk of harm to students staff and community members who use these facilities
4679825 i commend the board for making this difficult decision we all understand this is a difficult time in our economy not just in california but also nationwide
4679826 but to further deny or ignore this problem that threatens the safety of our students staff and community members and that so obviously sits in our midst is totally unacceptable this board recognized that and stepped up to rectify it
4679827 the rating criteria didnt help us grade the projects comprehensively
4679828 the product will be distributed in january of 2009 i suggest you keep tuned into the website for future information
4679829 its a great way for plaintiffs counsel and defense counsel to reach a middle ground
4679830 very often the cost of providing the product is less than having to pay cash
4679831 whether many people will actually come in for the free products that will be interesting to see
4679832 a short sale is one where title has transferred where the sales price was insufficient to pay the total of all liens and costs of sale and where the seller did not bring sufficient liquid assets to the closing to cure all deficiencies
4679833 i mean really its nothing a centimetres nothing but thats the way it is
4679834 its probably something that will be in the back of my mind for as long as i live to come that close is a little crushing i definitely dont want to relive that moment again but im positive and ill just move forward
4679835 we took a very business like approach to the race
4679836 our start is typically fast but what we did really really well today was the middle 1 000 metres we owned it
4679837 we probably relaxed just a bit more than we should have in the last 500 metres it would have been nice to finish first in the semi but were in the final and thats important
4679838 i was incredibly nervous the entire morning leading up to the competition and i didnt really know why
4679839 what happened today is good but im going to leave it behind me and know that saturday we all start at zero
4679840 a big high and then six outs away from even a higher high
4679841 we just couldnt execute in key situations and it came back to bite us
4679842 one pitch and the guy capitalized on it and it turned out to be the difference of the ballgame
4679843 hey i can play by myself dada you can go do your thing
4679844 i have no idea why bill kristol would be making this statement there is no imminent endorsement
4679845 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama for whatever reason i think he has decided hes going to endorse obama
4679846 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
4679847 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
4679848 here contemporary china bashing has echoes of yesterdays yellow peril fears about the chinese the idea of the chinese as peculiarly driven unemotional and unforgiving is an old prejudice that is being rehabilitated on the back of the olympic games
4679849 i cant really tell the difference between the chinese japanese and koreans
4679850 i can cant tell a zambian or malawian just by looking at them
4679851 let me ask you another question who is more useful to society a doctor or a monk
4679852 look at monasticism and conclude that it is useless and therefore must be discarded but when we are willing to employ a different criteria monasticism offers the supreme gift to humanity that modern individuals may not recognize
