7080195 we decided to repost the song tunguska death ray many people seemed to enjoy this song when we posted it to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the tunguska event on june 30th 2008 but we took it down a few days after the 30th since then weve had a few complaints that people added this song to their profile and now its gone since we are putting the final touches on our debut dvd album we figured wed upload this song one final time we also left octobers scarecrow up temporarily these are the last new songs well put up until autumnal equinox dvd is released perhaps some of you cheap bastards might actually buy this were not sure yet but plan on a show around halloween

7080262 im just saying yes because its possible i think it is possible sorry to say we dont have specific plans at the moment but it is possible yes
7080263 a very disappointing qualifying we seem to have struggled for pace here all weekend despite having been very fast in the last sector and its frustrating for the drivers to finish in 14th and 17th an incident filled race is the only way were likely to achieve any points this weekend so well wait and see congratulations to toro rosso who got both their cars into the top ten for the first time
7080264 weve struggled for speed for most of the weekend its a new venue here which brings variety to the positions but we dont seem to have the pace we had a few races ago which is quite frustrating there were a few laps i was pleased with but we didnt make it through to q3
7080265 i expected to be able to make it through that first part of qualifying on my last run i ran wide in turn 5 and dropped about four tenths although i pulled two tenths back the net loss over the whole lap meant it wasnt enough to go through its just the way these qualifying sessions go that was probably one my messiest sessions and im disappointed
7080266 a bad day and a bad result it was bad beginning to the week with the plane crash in madrid and the death of dino toso chief aerodynamicist for renault which puts things in perspective but life goes on and coming back to our present work we have to work like hell now to bounce back from here we already need to be thinking about the next race in spa

7080270 for its future china needs to become more international and the olympics was an important step in that
7080271 so it was crucial that the international community pay us due recognition
7080272 the olympics are a prism for the conflicts emotions and tendencies that are being worked out and worked out in public
7080273 hoped to show the world a china that after 30 years of rapid development has not been seen in hundreds of years

7080298 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7080299 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7080300 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7080301 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7080302 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7080303 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7080304 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7080305 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7080306 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7080307 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7080308 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7080309 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7080310 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7080311 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7080312 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7080313 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7080314 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure

7080327 its a blessing for me to be out on this floor now participating in my fourth olympics and walking away with a fourth gold medal
7080328 weve said from day one that top to bottom we are a deep team
7080329 we just send wave after wave of players at you
7080330 we werent going to be the team to let lisa lose
7080331 you cant shoot less than 40 percent and expect to win gold medals

7080333 islam does not forbid her my understanding is that if you commit a crime you take the punishment
7080334 if you are that religious you should not commit the crime anyway if you are that god fearing why would you want to take money away from other people that need it
7080335 you see tears theyre tears of happiness though we came a long way this tournament
7080336 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7080337 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7080338 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7080339 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7080340 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things
7080341 but i think i deserved a couple of things that didnt come to me
7080342 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7080343 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7080344 in the third set of images with phelps on the left it is clear he is really pushing hard while cavic on the right is just arriving
7080345 you cant just put your fingertips on the pad you really have to push it we explained all this directly after the race to cavic and his coach
7080346 we mainly use the photos for relays to determine disqualifications if someone dives in before a teammate touches
7080347 this is the only sport where athletes dont cross the finish line the athlete stops
7080348 this is very simple our sport is about which athlete stops the time by pushing the touchpad
7080349 ive been tested four times in china before i even started running these guys took urine tests and blood tests after every event final ive been tested
7080350 ive been tested out of competition so many times i lost track
7080351 i worked hard thats all i can say i worked hard to get here it wasnt easy at all it may look easy but it was hard
7080352 therefore all the records that have been broken by usain bolt and all the gold medals that have been won by other jamaicans have come after extensive testing
7080353 that as far as i am concerned is more than adequate proof
7080354 what i think almost amuses us is why some people in the world dont feel that others can be that good we have been good for a very long time
7080355 we have some marvelous talent here and wouldnt want anybody to suggest at all that this is not pure raw talent that has been properly trained and properly coached and properly presented and reaping the rewards of all that hard work
7080356 i wont change that and i dont see any problem with it because people enjoy watching me
7080357 its a blessing for me to be out on this floor now participating in my fourth olympics and walking away with a fourth gold medal
7080358 weve said from day one that top to bottom we are a deep team
7080359 we just send wave after wave of players at you
7080360 we werent going to be the team to let lisa lose
7080361 you cant shoot less than 40 percent and expect to win gold medals
7080362 the holy one the true who has the key of david
7080363 key of david and sceptre of the house of israel you who reign over the whole world come and free those who wait for you in darkness
7080364 for who has known the mind of the lord or who has been his counselor
7080365 or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid
7080366 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways says the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
7080367 something cannot be because we cannot understand it for what is more in conformity with reason than to think in the highest way of him who is the all high and to attribute to him the highest and best nature that our mind can conceive so it is that our failure to understand the sublimity of this mystery has a trace and scent of something divine because as we said god being infinite must necessarily be beyond our comprehension
7080368 he that was dead sat up and began to speak
7080369 blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
7080370 whom when the lord had seen being moved with mercy toward her he said to her weep not
7080371 he came near and touched the bier and they that carried it stood still and he said young man i say unto thee arise
7080372 he that was dead sat up and began to speak
7080373 and they glorified god saying a great prophet is risen up among us and god hath visited his people
7080374 them that kill the body and are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him that can destroy both body and soul in hell
7080375 laugh not not yet is this soul your prey i am the master of life the giver of grace
7080376 arise go in peace thy sins are forgiven thee rise to the life of grace rise to a new life in which sin shall no more have place go now and sin no more
7080377 soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thy rest eat drink make good cheer
7080378 fool this night do they require thy soul of thee
7080379 what doth it profit a man if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul

7080384 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7080385 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7080386 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7080387 georgia is not a member of this organization so the troops must leave very quickly
7080388 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7080389 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7080390 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that

7080395 accountability and self reliance love of country working hard without making excuses treating your neighbor as youd like to be treated
7080396 her fear of black men who passed by her on the street
7080397 where decency and endurance and the pioneer spirit were joined at the hip with conformity and suspicion and the potential for unblinking cruelty
7080398 but that was the age difference and not that she was mean or anything
7080399 generally shunned the tent revival circuit preferring a straight backed form of methodism that valued reason over passion and temperance over both
7080400 blanched whenever someone mentioned the subject and hoped to carry the secret to her grave
7080401 would turn her head in profile to show off her beaked nose which along with a pair of jet black eyes was offered as proof of cherokee blood
7080402 the thought occurred to me maybe that would be a good slogan for her grandson
7080403 glenn miller tommy dorsey benny goodman harry james i dont think there was a one from that era that we didnt have at the blue moon
7080404 black slicked back hair and his perpetual wise guy grin
7080405 gramps is probably too busy telling one of his jokes or arguing with toot their version of the hawaiian word
7080406 toot notices but shes polite enough to bite her lip and offer dessert her instincts warn her against making a scene
7080407 every morning she woke up at five a m and changed from the frowsy muu muus sic she wore around the apartment into a tailored suit and high heeled pumps
7080408 here you graduated from college so you should be able to figure out this file
7080409 i was young and just graduated and thought i could kill the world
7080410 she really put me straight she made a point of indicating that experience is equitable to going to college and she was right
7080411 never stopped dreaming of a house with a white picket fence days spent baking or playing bridge or volunteering at the local library
7080412 your grandfather and i just figured we should treat people decently bar
7080413 shes wise that way my grandmother suspicious of overwrought sentiments or overblown claims content with common sense
7080414 before you came in she told me the fella was black thats the real reason why shes bothered
7080415 never had they given me reason to doubt their love i doubted if they ever would
7080416 and yet i knew that men who might easily have been my brothers could still inspire their rawest fears
7080417 than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe
7080418 she was really a very liberal person liberal in politics and i think liberal in thinking

7080427 as humans we constantly incorporate other peoples current actions as clues cues as to what they may do in the future
7080428 for instance we have a sixth sense on the highway to know that a certain car will swerve into our lane soon based on the drivers current driving patterns then we may become more defensive in our own driving in our work we wanted to begin the process of allowing robots to use behavioral cues of humans or other robots to make the robots mission more reliable and accurate in social work environments populated by numerous people and robots these types of cues should be abundant

7080452 her fear of black men who passed by her on the street
7080453 where decency and endurance and the pioneer spirit were joined at the hip with conformity and suspicion and the potential for unblinking cruelty
7080454 but that was the age difference and not that she was mean or anything
7080455 generally shunned the tent revival circuit preferring a straight backed form of methodism that valued reason over passion and temperance over both
7080456 blanched whenever someone mentioned the subject and hoped to carry the secret to her grave
7080457 would turn her head in profile to show off her beaked nose which along with a pair of jet black eyes was offered as proof of cherokee blood
7080458 the thought occurred to me maybe that would be a good slogan for her grandson

7080464 here you graduated from college so you should be able to figure out this file
7080465 i was young and just graduated and thought i could kill the world
7080466 she really put me straight she made a point of indicating that experience is equitable to going to college and she was right
7080467 never stopped dreaming of a house with a white picket fence days spent baking or playing bridge or volunteering at the local library
7080468 your grandfather and i just figured we should treat people decently bar
7080469 shes wise that way my grandmother suspicious of overwrought sentiments or overblown claims content with common sense
7080470 before you came in she told me the fella was black thats the real reason why shes bothered
7080471 never had they given me reason to doubt their love i doubted if they ever would
7080472 and yet i knew that men who might easily have been my brothers could still inspire their rawest fears
7080473 than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe
7080474 she was really a very liberal person liberal in politics and i think liberal in thinking
7080475 frankly that story when it was in the book i felt didnt need to be in there
7080476 from our grandmother he gets his pragmatism his levelheadedness his ability to stay centered in the eye of the storm

7080501 what has happened is over the last decade and probably more the trustee corporations have placed profit in front of ethics
7080502 theres a lot of revenue thats made that you cant argue is illegal but fees dont have to be as high as they are
7080503 people feel they have to be nice and that if they upset the person across the table they wont get anything
7080504 a whole industry has grown up making money off families money
7080505 what has happened is over the last decade and probably more the trustee corporations have placed profit in front of ethics
7080506 most of this is through their management who regard fees as the most important part of the business rather than delivering service or looking after clients
7080507 under managements direction each branch was directed to come up with special fees which for an average branch would be around 250 000 upwards if they had four trust officers each trust officer was supposed to come up with so called special fees of around 20 000 per month
7080508 the key thing here is we dont charge for work that hasnt been completed
7080509 theres no question that we are a commercial organisation and we have shareholders and we intend to make a profit thats nothing to be ashamed about
7080510 in public trust we did see a real shift from an organisation that was very client centric to very much a revenue and profit driven organisation
7080511 trustee corporations would be similar to any other corporate where the powers that be the executives set their budgets for the organisation and have various ways to cascade that down
7080512 as long as i am chief executive we will never progress to the point of incentivising or creating the expectation of not selling to need
7080513 like many things in new zealand it has been left unattended for a long time
7080514 are estate companies better than each other i dont know but there needs to be a commission of inquiry a full shake out of trust and estate management in new zealand
7080515 is there a problem the fact you sunday star times
7080516 an on stage combination that will completely blow your mind
7080517 were going to be playing two supergroove sets but theres also going to be help from scribe hollie and gin were mixing it up well be playing with them on some of their tunes and theyll be playing with us on some of our tunes its a musical concoction everyone is a bit curious about how exactly its going to go
7080518 we were a little bit apprehensive because its all very well playing the old stuff but hows it actually going to be creating something new and it worked out fine and everybodys really happy with them weve grown up musically a bit and weve got a few more strings to our bows now so we can add those things into our new songs and that keeps it interesting and fresh but it still sounds like us its that same common musical ground that the seven of us occupy
7080519 the timing was right 10 years had passed and we had the distance to appreciate how special it would be to hang out again and weve all been enjoying it so much that we want to have it in our lives
7080520 i was struck that there are lots of young people who had never seen the band theyd come up after the show and say oh i was 10 years old so i never got to see you but wow what a great show you get some of the same people and some familiar faces from back in the day and thats great but i was surprised by the sheer number of youngies who came to check it out
7080521 well see how this one goes its very experimental this is not normally what bands do but were keen to try something different
7080522 get yea thy strongest toe clippers and a gouge for the jam and set to this pedicure nonsense
7080523 this new prudery is not i suspect anything to do with morality
7080524 if you think daniel carter is ugly join sick of all the jockey billboards ads and posters j oin if you think he is over rated join
7080525 were not saying hes a bad player hes just ugly

7080527 if u wouldnt tap that uve obviously fallen on ur head lately or ur gay
7080528 we need ongoing momentum and we have to court ongoing dialogue
7080529 that is where i think we have a great opportunity when we talk to carol wheeler shes only recently been appointed and i think its an indication that barack obama is taking the irish issue seriously
7080530 the recent european tour would have been a perfect opportunity to visit and touch base i think they might be holding back on the irish card
7080531 i wasnt even looking forward to the olympics and ive been mesmerised
7080532 i come out and i want to dance you want to jump for joy because everything feels in line
7080533 just to keep that spine aligned keep it straight to make sure i am tip top
7080534 if we demand that from our standard medicine then we should demand it from the alternative lot as well
7080535 completely and utterly outside any kind of reality that we know of
7080536 over the last 10 or so years there has been increased investment and interest in undertaking clinical trials with herbal medicines so the evidence base is increasing
7080537 at the other extreme the archetypal new ager will tell you that all natural health products work all the time and are safe because they are natural
7080538 see it as the answer to a range of much less clearly defined conditions allergies anxiety back pain fatigue depression digestive problems food sensitivities headaches insomnia skin disorders stress and overweight
7080539 setting the theory aside if medicine works whether its a tea leaf boiled up or a drug thats taken a pharmaceutical company millions to develop if it actually works and the evidence shows it works then thats an effective medicine

7080550 its both foolish and intellectually lazy to say well have another vote and this time theyll vote yes
7080551 i have mental pictures of mandarins in brussels or luxembourg or wherever and france who have the presidency now talking to their colleagues here in stephens green in dublin and saying lets give it another try lets dress up this part of it and that part of it
7080552 well i have news for you no matter what way it is dressed up or undressed another referendum is not going to work not in the near future or even medium term future how can one say the will of the people is sovereign lets have another vote
7080553 i feel there are parts contained in the lisbon treaty which can be effected by legislation
7080554 and we can leave that to one side for quite a long time
7080555 was it the perception that the eu helped women get more rights than our own government and in return we would vote for whatever was put in front of us regardless of whether or not the contents were communicated clearly
7080556 little effort was put into securing the support of women
7080557 full communication and debate which will include and address the concerns of women
7080558 i have been struck by the comments of some women that while they voted yes this year that they would view as profoundly anti democratic and insulting to voters any attempt to force a re run simply to overturn this troublesome result
7080559 its important there are maori views in parliament ill look to them but i havent really heard what theyve promised for people ive heard labour is guaranteeing no interest on student loans i was thinking thats a good thing thatll pull me their way
7080560 to make sure our children dont become what the media think
7080561 when i was in year 9 they werent going anywhere after they left school
7080562 i know what goes down on a friday night in a small town i think they do as much as they can to keep the buzz going
7080563 the huge land losses the social cultural economic and political marginalisation of maori society and mass migration to the cities from 1950 onwards
7080564 i grew up in ponsonby but i come from here
7080565 but its getting faster its getting rougher you dont realise it until you move away from it
7080566 kaikohe is the home turf for shane jones and hone harawira
7080567 and those guys are here all the time they support church marae local initiatives
7080568 thats missing now there are no set foundations they dont grow up with the values our people grew up with in the beginning
7080569 ive never ever made up my mind until ive reached the booth but weve been listening to the parliament channel and getting a really good laugh from it and i cant hear strength from john key i listen for strength and their policies and i cant hear any strength
7080570 he just thought it would be a good place to bring up kids its out of the concrete jungle kaikohe is kind of like an old shoe now its comfortable isnt it its got everything you want lifestyle climate and its a good town
7080571 i looked at what was being imported to the town and decided to make trailers youre only limited by your imagination
7080572 voil un vin de table bu hier vendredi en plus
7080573 yeah yeah thats what i meant so where would you go
7080574 id have to do what yer man did in back to the future 2 and get rich off the book that gave all the sports results for the next fifty years
7080575 nah i dont like sport people would suss me out
7080576 yeah it would serve you right for not sharing the wealth
7080577 like no matter how much money i had that delorean would never pass the
7080578 sure why would that even matter you could travel back to a simpler time when there was no nct at all happy days
7080579 yeah but what if i was trying to get up to 88 mph and i got pulled in for speeding
7080580 yeah and theyd probably follow me even if i did reach the optim otpr optimu top speed and make it back to yesteryear
7080581 can you imagine on the 9 oclock news with your one that looks like a fake tanned foreskin
7080582 cant see willie odea giving the go ahead for a fictional piece of hardware for the gardai to chase down time bandits
7080583 thatd be a great occupation to have on your cv wouldnt it
7080584 time bandit thats be a real ice breaker in an interview
7080585 what would happen though if your time machine broke down though and you didnt have the luxury of your own mad scientist to fix it
7080586 well ahead of you id have christopher lloyd locked up in storage
7080587 you know that he only played the character in the movies he wouldnt actually know how to fix the time machine
7080588 oh yeah but he could look after stephen hawkin who i would also would have pre captured then he could act out and pretend that he had fixed it
7080589 if my time machine broke down tomorrow could i get it fixed yesterday
7080590 the diesel version is easy to drive thanks to its tremendous torque
7080591 its more controllable than the petrol powered car over challenging terrain and accelerates faster out of corners
7080592 with the right set up it would be comfortably faster
7080593 a magnificent structure and in my view has a wonderful combination of architectural acoustics and theatrical aesthetics its three functional houses have been designed to the highest possible specifications
7080594 and it was he who came up with the idea of a collection of new plays written by people living here or from here this would be something that could go on tour but those venues which expressed an interest wouldnt take all three together so we decided to keep it here as a celebration of new work we feel that theres a need for it in the city and in the county

7080597 all the records that have broken and all of the medals that have been won by jamaica the last two weeks have come after extensive testing of all of our athletes
7080598 what i think almost amuses us is why some people in the world dont fell that others can be that good
7080599 we have some marvelous talent here i wouldnt want anyone to suggest that this isnt pure raw talent that has been properly trained properly coached and properly presented and that we arent reaping the rewards of all that hard work
7080600 i worked hard all year for this it may have looked easy but it was hard
7080601 us jamaicans were very proud we work hard for what we want and we want to be on top if you guys would just come to jamaica once and see how hard we train youd be surprised we have some serious coaches down there they push us to be the best we can be
7080602 i was tested four times before i even started running these guys took urine tests and blood tests after every event final ive been tested ive been tested so many times out of competition ive lost track
7080603 we train hard we know were good we know were clean anytime they want to test us its okay with us
7080604 ive been able to represent my country since i was 24 years old its been just awesome
7080605 all the rhythm in my soul is gone im in trouble

7080624 this was always the hotbed of surfing because its one of the most consistent breaks
7080625 its a different backdrop than someplace tropical but its great to be in new york and to jump in the water and surf thats incredible
7080626 its a healthy fun sport its exciting when the waves are big and you see guys who can really surf well by the same token i always tell people if youre a beginner and you stand the amount of enjoyment that youre getting out of it equals the enjoyment a pro guy would get by scoopin up a 20 foot wave
7080627 not only for exercise but its fun to be out here doing something other than sunbathing or tossing a frisbee
7080628 catch a wave and youre sittin on top of the world
7080629 hes catholic enough to appeal to catholics pro life enough to avoid some church attacks and pro choice enough to satisfy hillary voters
7080630 catholics are listening carefully to what the candidates have to say but very few are following the dictates of the catholic bishops when it comes to politics
7080631 while catholic republicans and democrats and mccain and obama voters may disagree on national priorities majorities of all of these voters strongly agree that catholics are not obligated to heed the bishops recommendations
7080632 sixty nine percent of catholics do not feel obligated to vote against candidates who support abortion despite what the us bishops promote the majority of catholics disagree with the bishops about a wide range of sexual and reproductive health issues
7080633 reason these states are increasingly in play is the rapid population growth among two key demographic pro democratic segments hispanics and white college graduates and the concomitant decline of the pro republican white working class

7080638 second will white college educated voters who are steadily increasing their share of the electorate continue their movement toward the democrats if so that would significantly undercut the gops chances of holding the state
7080639 third will minorities particularly hispanics whose share of voters is rapidly growing turn out for the democrats given their very high levels of support for the democrats in the 2004 election which appear likely to continue in this election the greater their turnout the better for the democrats ditto for single women who have also been recording very high support levels for the democrats

7080672 accountability and self reliance love of country working hard without making excuses treating your neighbor as youd like to be treated
7080673 her fear of black men who passed by her on the street
7080674 where decency and endurance and the pioneer spirit were joined at the hip with conformity and suspicion and the potential for unblinking cruelty
7080675 but that was the age difference and not that she was mean or anything
7080676 generally shunned the tent revival circuit preferring a straight backed form of methodism that valued reason over passion and temperance over both
7080677 blanched whenever someone mentioned the subject and hoped to carry the secret to her grave
7080678 would turn her head in profile to show off her beaked nose which along with a pair of jet black eyes was offered as proof of cherokee blood
7080679 the thought occurred to me maybe that would be a good slogan for her grandson
7080680 black slicked back hair and his perpetual wise guy grin
7080681 gramps is probably too busy telling one of his jokes or arguing with toot their version of the hawaiian word
7080682 toot notices but shes polite enough to bite her lip and offer dessert her instincts warn her against making a scene
7080683 every morning she woke up at five a m and changed from the frowsy muu muus sic she wore around the apartment into a tailored suit and high heeled pumps
7080684 here you graduated from college so you should be able to figure out this file
7080685 i was young and just graduated and thought i could kill the world
7080686 she really put me straight she made a point of indicating that experience is equitable to going to college and she was right
7080687 never stopped dreaming of a house with a white picket fence days spent baking or playing bridge or volunteering at the local library
7080688 your grandfather and i just figured we should treat people decently bar
7080689 shes wise that way my grandmother suspicious of overwrought sentiments or overblown claims content with common sense
7080690 before you came in she told me the fella was black thats the real reason why shes bothered
7080691 never had they given me reason to doubt their love i doubted if they ever would
7080692 and yet i knew that men who might easily have been my brothers could still inspire their rawest fears
7080693 than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe
7080694 she was really a very liberal person liberal in politics and i think liberal in thinking
7080695 frankly that story when it was in the book i felt didnt need to be in there
7080696 from our grandmother he gets his pragmatism his levelheadedness his ability to stay centered in the eye of the storm

7080702 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7080703 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7080704 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7080705 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things
7080706 but i think i deserved a couple of things that didnt come to me
7080707 little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but peace easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things
7080708 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
7080709 any fool can criticize condemn and complain and most fools do
7080710 the state is that great fiction by which everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else
7080711 when somebody persuades me that i am wrong i change my mind what do you do
7080712 whatever it is that government does sensible americans would prefer that the government do it to someone else this is the idea behind foreign policy
7080713 nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing
7080714 never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity
7080715 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with inherent and inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governme walt whitman

7080722 we are emulating things that take us further away from our football and we are depriving children of their childhood there is too much emphasis on work in the gym on weight training and speed and too much pressure on kids as young as seven or eight to win this is not good
7080723 i believe strongly in respecting the stages there is a time when you have to play for fun enjoy the game argentinas strong point has always been technique if you look at the best players in europe they are always the ones who are technically excellent gyms and machines can never give you what keepy uppies and contact with the ball do for a child

7080729 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
7080730 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
7080731 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
7080732 if theyre investigating cj you guys meaning our little circle of mom friends here in town are all in trouble youd better just go down to the cps office and turn yourself in

7080738 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7080739 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7080740 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7080741 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7080742 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7080743 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7080744 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7080745 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7080746 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7080747 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7080748 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7080749 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7080750 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7080751 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7080752 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7080753 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7080754 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure

7080767 obama has spent millions on his change message in indiana biden has held onto a seat in the senate since 1972 how does that represent change
7080768 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century
7080769 he biden has distinguished himself as a member of the united states senate and is an accomplished public servant i wish him well in his bid for higher office but remain a supporter and ally of senator john mccain
7080770 in selecting senator joe biden as his running mate senator obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of

7080850 you want somebody who can drive the message of the day and can win the vice presidential debate one of the things that this campaign showed is that joe biden is a good retail politician
7080851 let us not look backward in anger or forward in fear but around in awareness

7080853 uss new orleans was degraded in her ability to conduct sustained combat operations
7080854 wholeheartedly supported the actions of federal agents in the waco standoff and visibly sneered at witnesses in senate hearings who questioned agents acts
7080855 all serbs should be placed in nazi style concentration camps
7080856 a bunch of illiterates degenerates baby killers butchers and rapists
7080857 i think that this is time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like they do get along and they dont have fundamental disagreements on major policies
7080858 its incredibly exciting and something that i think will change the way i think
7080859 the chinese culture is changing and evolving so to be immersed in it is a rare opportunity
7080860 no signifique que s lo funcione con ese juego jugar al
7080861 no record will ever go gold again cause theres this thing called limewire
7080862 i could read from ratan tatas statement that he is troubled in west bengal so i invited him to come here instead and we will give him a red carpet welcome there are a lot of probable sites for the nana project in maharashtra we have a mega project policy in maharashtra and whatever concessions there are in that policy will be given to the tatas if they decided to come here
7080863 we will offer a market price to the farmers and give proper compensation for their land all problems related to land acquisition for industry have become synonymous with the state of west bengal
7080864 orissa is willing to consider the nano project if tata approaches us
7080865 tata has already acquired a lot of land at bhopalpur in orissa this could be the probable site for nano if tata agrees
7080866 i will soon write an offer letter to tata group to formally invite them to install its nano plant in punjab for which every possible facility will be provided by the state government
7080867 the state would make one of the best available offers to the tatas once the offer is discussed in a threadbare manner every issue would be sorted out

7080873 i was pained and angered by the atrocities against muslims worldwide and the turning point was the demolition of the babri masjid and the gujarat riots only made matters worse
7080874 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
7080875 all this talk about creation of indian mujahideen images needs to be probed i would not be surprised if such an organization has been floated by fundamentalist bodies like the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad with the sole intention of defaming muslims
7080876 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone but the manner adopted by the investigating agencies speaks of a blatant bias and a predetermined approach
7080877 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
7080878 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists

7080894 the go to statement as it stands is just too primitive it is too much an invitation to make a mess of ones program one can regard and appreciate the clauses considered as bridling its use i do not claim that the clauses mentioned are exhaustive in the sense that they will satisfy all needs but whatever clauses are suggested e g abortion clauses they should satisfy the requirement that a programmer independent coordinate system can be maintained to describe the process in a helpful and manageable way

7080900 i was slow and that was it i dont need to start telling you what happened on the lap we were not fast enough

7080912 russias role in a multi polar world between change and stability
7080913 accepting russia as an equal in international negotiations is a prerequisite for solving todays global challenges
7080914 the war in georgia divided the european union instead of uniting it some member states condemned russia and gave non military aid to the georgian government others accused tbilisi of provoking the war their reactions suggest that eu capitals make different assumptions about moscows goals and intentions towards countries on russias borders and about europes interests in these countries
7080915 i will have no hesitation in raising issues with westminster when that is the right thing to do but i will do so with the intention of finding solutions to problems scotland is a forward looking nation which of course seeks to do the best for its people scots should be confident enough in themselves to know that we can still work within the united kingdom while expressing our own distinctiveness

7080985 we had the one day friday where it kind of came back thats why we decided to do what we did it has gotten better the treatment and stuff is definitely working
7080986 so were dealing with that too the doctors say its going to help so were going with it
7080987 i think that was part of the problem yesterday having that whole day off and not doing any treatments
7080988 if theres a bright spot on our club this year its that jody geruts back
7080989 well be very comfortable if he is our center fielder next year
7080990 if we pass this bill which the democrats irresponsibly oppose well solve this problem
7080991 if we bring a new attitude of hopefulness and respect for the world well make the seas higher and the fish more numerous
7080992 our choice wasnt between a benign status quo and the bloodshed of war it was between war and a greater threat dont let anyone tell you otherwise and certainly not a disingenuous filmmaker who would have us believe that saddams iraq was an oasis of peace

7080996 i havent necessarily played great during this tournament tonight i got into some foul trouble as did diana taurasi and katie smith but we fought hard and we beat australia
7080997 sie ist so versessen darauf zu heiraten und kinder zu haben dass er sich dadurch eingeengt f hlte
7080998 its just such an accomplishment for this team and the usa and these girls
7080999 theres no disappointment if we would have come out today and not fought id maybe have a different answer to that
7081000 i cant explain to you where our team was several months ago and where we are now from inside out how weve grown how weve played for each other
7081001 as the tournament went on the more i believed in us and where we could go and what we could do thats a tribute to all the girls
7081002 we wouldnt be here right now if not for logan

7081004 all in all the citizens of the united states of america and indeed people around the world can be proud of our team
7081005 me temo que lo relacionado con ese caso cada d a est m s en manos de los historiadores y menos en las de los juristas
7081006 el r gimen autoritario se vio obligado a entregar el poder al perder las elecciones pero realmente nunca rindi cuentas los verdaderos responsables pol ticos en torno a esos acontecimientos no fueron enjuiciados y eso es realmente lamentable
7081007 es algo formidable pero deber a ir acompa ado de la reconstrucci n de las memorias m ltiples no solamente del movimiento estudiantil del 68 y de esa poca todav a poco explorada
7081008 la distancia se ahonda porque si no hay suficientes descripciones novelas relatos y cine al respecto todo tiende a si no a olvidarse s a guardarse y eso es algo en lo que todos debemos cooperar para recuperar
7081009 debe cooperar sobre todo la universidad nacional aut noma de m xico pues tiene el deber de trabajar muy firmemente en ello
7081010 con respecto al 68 creo que este gobierno como el pasado tiene la asignatura de mantener vivo el recuerdo y de hacer todo lo posible por reconstruir lo destruido
7081011 es completamente diferente a la que hubo en el 68 porque en aquella hab a un exceso de cultura llamada juvenil o de juvenilismo que tuvo sus virtudes pero tambi n sus defectos
7081012 la juventud es una enfermedad que se cura con el tiempo

7081016 there are a lot of midfielders in the team but they all have different qualities guardiola has asked me to come from deep and score goals

7081053 reviewing the terms of that contract and other contracts with pa consulting
7081054 i am shocked by the level of expenditure on consultants and even more shocked by the way the government seems to have become dependent on consultants for the delivery of core public services
7081055 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20bn id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco
7081056 this will destroy any confidence the public still have in this white elephant and reinforce why it could endanger rather than strengthen our security
7081057 frankly the keystone cops would do a better job running the home office and keeping our data safe than this government and if this government cannot keep the data of thousands of guilty people safe why on earth should we give them the data of millions of innocent people in an id card database
7081058 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels

7081078 the board will keep working on enrollment and continue working on just providing quality teaching programs and that sort of thing
7081079 the reauthorization of the higher education act included across the board changes that were not handled in the previous reconciliation bill
7081080 colleges that identify preferred lenders to place at least three lenders on the list and clearly explain to students why the college believes the lender is offering attractive terms and conditions
7081081 im just like inviting you on the bandwagon of my own uncertainty
7081082 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7081083 today the iranian nation has obtained the technology to produce different kinds of satellites and with gods help it will launch its first telecommunications satellite into space
7081084 our nation has a modern missile that can launch the second stage missile 250 km 150 miles into space the second stage is a smaller missile carrying the satellite which has very complex technical equipment
7081085 but did so and so get banned and how about so and so
7081086 i think a lot of people have written us off this year
7081087 we get a chance this year to not have that no 1 on our backs and to just go out and play and prove a lot of people wrong
7081088 i think this year were focusing on the fact that were this new team
7081089 we have a lot to offer and its going to be those little things that are going to matter this year
7081090 well there are a lot of new people which makes it a little more difficult at the beginning of the season
7081091 but as of right now i think were all starting to mesh
7081092 i just had this like almost a wave of jealousy
7081093 oh man when i was a kid nobody ever said that to me it was more like get out of here or what the hell are you playing
7081094 i think so much has changed ever since birth control came around
7081095 i think about how many social attitudes have altered how much is different now that the economic relationship between men and women is really different a woman is way more likely to support herself than to be supported by a man at this point
7081096 the only way you could curtail that would be with rules that are known from the outset or voluntarily adopted by these athletes as they move forward in this sport
7081097 here its different because you have essentially the state stepping in to take punitive action and that is your typical first amendment scenario
7081098 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7081099 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7081100 we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president
7081101 i congratulate sen barack obama on his selection of my friend sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7081102 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century
7081103 i believe that joe biden is an excellent choice he is a man of experience and high integrity he will be a valuable running mate to sen obama
7081104 obama has spent millions on his change message in indiana biden has held onto a seat in the senate since 1972 how does that represent change
7081105 this is a terrific choice joe biden understands the challenges facing our country at home and abroad and his long history of bipartisanship in the senate will be a welcome asset he will be a tireless and enthusiastic partner for sen obama in the campaign and in the white house
7081106 sen biden will be a tremendous partner for sen obama and for michigan our state has been battered by the policies of the bush administration so it matters to us that sen biden has a long standing reputation of bringing real results that matter to americans
7081107 he has distinguished himself as a member of the united states senate and is an accomplished public servant i wish him well in his bid for higher office but remain a supporter and ally of sen john mccain
7081108 joe brings experience to baracks message of change together democrats are offering the american people change experience and good judgment a winning combination if there ever was one
7081109 joe biden has always been my first choice and i am pleased to learn he is sen obamas first choice as well i am proud of joe and believe his experience in the u s senate and as a national leader in foreign policy makes him an excellent candidate for vice president
7081110 in selecting sen joe biden as his running mate sen obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of
7081111 in choosing joe biden to join him on the ticket barack has struck olympic gold i competed against biden in the 88 campaign he is a bona fide expert on the judiciary and foreign policy
7081112 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
7081113 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
7081114 a escolha de biden decepcionante por que ele o criador da id ia de dividir o iraque
7081115 n s rejeitamos sua proposta e ainda a rejeitamos dividir as comunidades e a terra daquele jeito s iria levar a novos conflitos entre as pessoas por recursos e fronteiras o iraque n o pode sobreviver a n o ser que esteja unido e divid lo poderia deixar os problemas vivos por muito tempo

7081135 hai orang orang yang beriman bertakwalah kepada allah dan tinggalkanlah sisa riba yang belum dipungut jika kamu orang orang yang beriman maka jika kamu tidak mengerjakan meninggalkan sisa riba maka ketahuilah bahwa allah dan rasulnya akan memerangimu dan jika kamu bertaubat dari pengambilan riba maka bagimu pokok hartamu kamu tidak menganiaya dan tidak pula dianiaya

7081139 tidak dibenarkan pula bagi pemilik modal untuk mengajukan syarat yang menyatakan bahwa uang dalam qirad tidak perlu dikembalikan dalam jangka waktu tertentu karena qirad tidak memiliki jangka waktu tertentu
7081140 orang orang yang memakan riba tidak dapat berdiri dengan betul kecuali sepertinya berdirinya seorang yang dirasuk syaitan dengan tehuyung huyung karena sentuhan syaitan itu
7081141 yang demikian ialah karena mereka mengatakan bahwa sesungguhnya berjual beli bertataniaga itu sama saja seperti riba pada hal allah telah menghalalkan berjual beli dan mengharamkan riba
7081142 karena itu sesiapa yang telah sampai kepadanya peringatan larangan dari tuhannya lalu dia berhenti dari mengambil riba maka apa yang telah diambilnya dahulu sebelum pengharaman itu adalah menjadi haknya dan halnya terserahlah kepada allah
7081143 dan sesiapa yang mengulangi lagi perbuatan mengambil riba maka mereka itulah ahli neraka dan kekal di dalamnya maka jika kamu tidak meninggalkan sisa sisa riba maka ketahuilah bahwa allah dan rasulnya akan memerangimu
7081144 jika kamu mendapati diri kamu di kalangan ahli ahli zina hendaklah kamu kuat dalam shariat mengenai zina jika kamu mendapati diri kamu dikalangan peminum khamr hendaklah kamu kuat berpegang pada shariat mengenai khamar

7081199 he successfully kept the cias connection to the bombing from becoming public
7081200 the cia and fbi took control of the crash scene for the first day keeping scottish police at bay searching through and removing numerous pieces of evidence and luggage from the wreckage to obscure the connections of the bombing to the cia special team that was on board the aircraft
7081201 one cia defector has said that the team had been returning to the states against orders to blow the whistle on cia drug and terrorist connections in the middle east
7081202 mebo ltd and myself have obviously been misused by the scottish justice and lord advocate colin boyd to construct a wrong link from lockerbie to libya more news on our webpage
7081203 edwin and mahnaz bollier mebo ltd give the crown lord advocate general and the appeal court the full warranty that the manipulated mst 13 timer fragment pt 35b does not come from a timer supplied to libya and therefore cannot be brought in connection with libya
7081204 this tricky suppression of the whole statement by the worlds leading news agencies leads to the generally accepted but nevertheless totally wrong notion if they paid they did it
7081205 us president bush signed on august 4 2008 into law s 3370 the libyan claims resolution act the bill that grants libyan immunity law and full diplomatic and economic status
7081206 jeez edwin amp mahnaz bollier youll find few in scotland that dont know that al megrahi was just the fall guy the main reason for the yanks wanting him jailed was his expertise as libyas no 1 sanction buster via malta
7081207 few folks will be aware of two important background features of the lockerbie investigation and trial both are verified by historical and declassified documents and available for easy reference
7081208 this aspect was under investigated by the lockerbie trial defence and ignored by the judges in the lockerbie judgment
7081209 the man was not called to give evidence at the lockerbie trial
7081210 in an on camera interview he admitted that his name was on the original list of witnesses but he presumed that the us authorities had removed it
7081211 we shall have to wait and see whether these two aspects will fully emerge during a second appeal
7081212 ulrich lumpert a swiss electronic engineer and former employee at the zurich based mebo ltd telecommunication has admitted that he stole from the company a hand manufactured mst 13 timer pc board that was later used as evidence against the defendant libyan agent abdel basset al megrahi
7081213 i realized that the mst 13 pc board after it was handed over by me without permission was misused for deliberate politically criminal action
7081214 sources close to megrahis lawyers said the new tests pointed to the evidence having been planted at the scene of the crash
7081215 the source added that megrahis legal team claimed they had obtained clear proof that investigators had planted and manipulated evidence
7081216 he said if there is any justice in scotland certain scottish police officers will be jailed for their part in the proceedings
7081217 megrahis lawyers already have a sworn statement from a retired scottish police officer confirming that evidence had been planted to secure the libyans conviction
7081218 a similar claim was made by a former cia agent
7081219 the ex cia man claimed that the fragment of circuit board had been planted under orders from a very high level in the organisation
7081220 the fragment was found by two policeman during a search of a wood near newcastleton 35 miles from lockerbie
7081221 it was later identified by the cias thomas thurman as being part of a sophisticated timer device made by the swiss firm of mebo
7081222 thurman was later unmasked as a fraud who had given false evidence in american murder trials
7081223 unilateral steps to break up the coalition we regret deeply that the ppp has not honored its agreements which we have in writing

7081225 there are two sides to a story and i guarantee that will come out in the end
7081226 mommy and daddy are going to a wedding all by themselves and im going to miss elaines house
7081227 hes a very tough well spoken man and i really think thats going to be great for baracks campaign
7081228 im from illinois ive had nothing less than 100 support for barack obama but from a larger perspective if you look at all the electorate they might find some measure of security of familiarity with joe biden
7081229 when we see him on television his speeches sound good

7081234 che abbia voglia di esserci positivo spiega spalletti e lui pu dare molto ma ancora non in condizione di farlo

7081237 totti un giocatore fantastico ma la roma ha dimostrato di saper vincere anche senza di lui piuttosto i giallorossi non sono gli stessi dello scorso anno senza mancini
7081238 the only problem i have had since doing sensing murder is a phone call at 1am from a male who talked about one of the cases
7081239 he said he watched me on the programme and to keep my mouth shut as you know too much
7081240 i dont let people like that frighten me as i will still carry on with the cases even though some cases are with gangs and drug rings
7081241 i know i am being looked after otherwise spirit a supernatural being she says helps her in her crime solving would not let me do the work
7081242 after filming that episode i ended up very sick in hospital with water on my lungs
7081243 i went over to the other side and she agnes was there i had taken on what she had passed over with as she had drowned in a ditch
7081244 the hospital could not understand that in such a short space of time i had become so ill
7081245 every case i work on upsets me and some are worse then others when i go into a case i go and give it all 100 percent
7081246 when i come back home i have to work it through in my own mind and i just want to be left alone i find my own peace with the person i am working with
7081247 i never talk about the case and my family and friends understand that
7081248 i sign a confidentiality contract that i am not permitted to speak about it to anyone until the case has been viewed on tv
7081249 what did they want me to do do leave her on the side of the road
7081250 im not a bad mother i love my daughter and would do anything for her
7081251 i told the police what did you want me to do leave her on the side of the street while we did what we were doing sativa was never left alone
7081252 the court said im not allowed to be in contact with michael but he will always be part of my life
7081253 he is sativas dad and she has to see him
7081254 the only reason i said i wont have contact with him was because of my daughter and to stay out of jail
7081255 he gets parole in may about the same time im off home d
7081256 hed say im doing this and if you are not coming stuff you
7081257 we had no money and it was a last resort
7081258 we were living in a little s box it was tough going
7081259 i dont like what i have done but my partner is a hard person to say no to
7081260 jessica has been given a chance by the courts and needs to realise how lucky she is
7081261 its not the smartest move by her to take her baby to burglaries because anything could happen
7081262 i grew up in otara and i saw the bad and some good
7081263 there was a lot of bad in the past and to witness that and come out where i am now shows just how strong otaras made me
7081264 i hung out on the streets with my mates probably doing stuff that youre not supposed to do but thats part of learning and rugby league was the path i chose i was strong enough to kick on and everything fell into place
7081265 the stuff allans involved with for south auckland is quite tremendous
7081266 theyre trying to steer kids in the right direction and choose the right path im a prime example i chose the right one
7081267 you see some kids who could be the next big thing but they get caught up with gangs and peer pressure
7081268 it is disappointing but thats why we haveprogrammes like allan has to give them that chance for pursuing their dreams
7081269 for us at 274 its all about our kids having a dream and a vision for the future just having ruben come back to the hood after hes succeeded in the realm of sport and league its a real shot in the arm for our kids
7081270 rubens a real big role model every time i see ruben come back it moves my heart because not many people who succeed come back to the neighbourhood and give back
7081271 otara is not a dirty mark otara for us means promise theres so many kids who have promise in this neighbourhood all they need is a hand up
7081272 and ruben has joined with us to give our kids a hand up so were very proud of this partnership with ruben and were proud of him too
7081273 i went back to my old primary last week mayfield primary and in one class i was teaching them bullying was not ok
7081274 two little kids came and whispered in my ear im not going to be a bully no more
7081275 i felt strange police were going out of their way
7081276 initially i thought police were looking after me but after the third call i felt the calls were unusual and i was wondering why there was so much concern for one person
7081277 he wanted to take advantage of my vulnerability and just wanted to hook up for sex i think it was totally unprofessional it makes you wonder how often he is doing this to others
7081278 she follows him around the world having his kids and living everywhere that he travels to and never once complained about the amount of time he was away from home while shes bringing up his kids
7081279 and then he just walks out for another younger woman
7081280 im focussed on the walk and im not going to give you any more than that
7081281 no but the boys are very excited by the walk
7081282 theyre right into their motorbikes and i sent them a shot of the police on the bikes there they loved it
7081283 you dont have to put an age limit on your dreams
7081284 i still constantly crave it its still messing up my world
7081285 i still get absolute gut wrenching cravings and i am constantly dreaming about p
7081286 every day is still such a struggle to stay clean
7081287 at first i had really bad nerve damage and i shook all the time and i never thought that was going to come right
7081288 i shook really badly for seven months and i still have occassional shakes
7081289 its not like you can just stop and all the symptoms go away they stay with you for a long time
7081290 i did some horrible things when i was on p
7081291 i was abusive and i ritualistically killed animals i couldnt control what i was doing
7081292 it terrifies me that a drug could have that sort of effect on someone
7081293 if p can do that to me and i love animals then it really scares me that the next step from killing animals is people
7081294 i no longer have to worry that people are out to get me and that the police are out to get me
7081295 i was a fully blown addict i was injecting it and i know that if i have just one more hit i will be right back into it again
7081296 the hardest thing about staying clean is knowing that p is always out there knowing that the next buzz is just around the corner that its in my neighbourhood and it is so easy to get
7081297 i want to be a drug and alcohol counsellor because i want to help other people who have been through what i have had to deal with
7081298 if i never got into drugs my life would have been so different
7081299 being on p was a totally different existence it was like living in a different world an underground world
7081300 i dont think people understand how dangerous a drug p really is
7081301 i go to narcotics anonymous and thats a great support but apart from that there is no after care
7081302 it is a very drinkable beer especially in the summer its one that people will try as opposed to the bigger bolder more challenging beers
7081303 real fruit is less consistent than extract with differences in sugar content and pectin levels and the fruit can clog hoses and equipment
7081304 with an extract customers will get the same thing every time they order it
7081305 in the mid 1990s everybody had a raspberry wheat beer
7081306 the popularity declined in the late 1990s and early 2000s then brewers started doing different things with the beers emulating traditional belgian fruit styles

7081310 weve got millions of dollars every year being spent on drugs and alcohol abuse prevention but its not doing any good
7081311 so if its not doing any good then we have to look at the policies surrounding p and change them because at the moment theyve got it wrong
7081312 we need someone who has got balls and guts in parliament
7081313 p is a big problem in this country most of the children who are murdered have been the result of an underlying factor of methamphetamine
7081314 especially if the addict is tweaking and coming off it because thats when the aggression starts to set in and thats when youre in trouble
7081315 youll either end up dead or badly beaten up and thats a sad thing
7081316 the success rate of getting a user off the drug is only about 10 percent it is an evil devil drug and it needs to be addressed
7081317 cleaning up our drug and alcohol problem and addressing the vast issues surrounding p has to be the no 1 priority for this country
7081318 if we can sort out the drug problem then we can sort out the crime problem in new zealand
7081319 we can stop the abuse of children the murders and the burglaries

7081334 he would terminate his contract and the courts would decide what he has to pay we want robinho to stay at madrid but this situation leaves us unable to do anything
7081335 would never retain a player against his wishes so we have no alternative to accept the unilateral rescinding of his contract
7081336 he can leave as early as possible but he must accept the consequences of rescinding a contract which has two years to run

7081354 mi piacerebbe che fosse messa in risalto la bellezza sia fisica che spirituale delle suore ha detto alladnkronos padre rungi stiamo parlando di persone molto preparate che operano nel sociale dove oltre alla bellezza spirituale ma per avere visibilit c anche bisogno di una bella presenza
7081355 lidea mi venuta parlando con alcune sorelle con le quali stavo pregando sulla spiaggia di mondragone ha spiegato il prete casertano eravamo in preghiera con turisti e villeggianti a dimostrazione di quanto sia aperta la mentalit di queste suore
7081356 si tratta di uniniziativa che sfrutta le potenzialit del web ha sottolineato padre rungi infatti verr gestita interamente su internet
7081357 gli stessi utenti del web il contatto non sar diretto ma online
7081358 e importante ha aggiunto don rungi sfruttare tutte le potenzialit del web infatti lassociazionismo cattolico molto attivo in questo campo daltronde ormai il modo migliore per poter mediare con i giovani
7081359 vorrei che si sfatasse il mito della suora vecchia trascurata e cattiva ha spiegato padre rungi ce ne sono tante soprattutto quelle che fanno formazione con i giovani che sono estremamente attive e preparate devono essere soprattutto al passo coi tempi visto che hanno a che fare con ragazzi
7081360 ho ricevuto anche qualche mail di dissenso ha ammesso padre rungi di cristiani che non hanno colto lo spirito di evangelizzazione insito in questa idea purtroppo alcune persone hanno una mentalit ancora chiusa e pensano che si debbano utilizzare solo i media tradizionali

7081366 teachers and their students to have the best of both worlds
7081367 the online environment is not the ideal setting for all types of learning classrooms are not perfect either thats why so many teachers and corporate trainers are concentrating their efforts on integrating internet based technologies and classrooms to create blended learning environments it just makes good sense
7081368 effective blending lets an organization spend the dollars in the most beneficial cost effective way

7081404 it is unconscionable for the democratic leadership to allow the head of a group that is connected to terrorism and that spreads hate against others to participate in a political convention we demand that mattson be disinvited from speaking at the democratic convention immediately isna and mattson should be condemned for their actions
7081405 in a good way because they are iconic you know instantly recognisable for their sheer brilliance like the
7081406 its definitely something that has to be addressed because of what i do for this team and what ive done since ive been here bringing this team from one of the bottom teams in the league to a playoff team to a team that won 49 games
7081407 i wont be comfortable going into this season knowing i have to play this whole season being the fifth highest paid and not get an extension i would not be happy

7081410 you cant just say its x86 so its going to solve the massively parallel computing problem
7081411 with an os they dont control and applications coming from everywhere
7081412 multi processing is a hard problem in computer science its been there for 30 years its not answered by software tools
7081413 theyve put out a certain amount of technical disclosure in the past five weeks
7081414 but although they make larrabee sound like its a fundamentally better approach it snt they dont tell you the assumptions they made they talk about scaling but they disregard memory bandwidth they make it sound good but we say you neglected half a dozen things
7081415 every gpu we make we always consider this type of design we do a reasoned analysis and we always conclude no thats why we havent built that type of machine
7081416 as blogger and cpu architect peter glaskowsky said the large larrabee in 2010 will have roughly the same performance as a 2006 gpu from nvidia or ati
7081417 weve looked very closely at this and we know there are certain things we can do better there will be improvements to things from all angles there are some easy fixes in the software domain that will soon be forthcoming believe me its a very prime focus of ours
7081418 ati has had the benefit for a long time of seeing nvidias products and having something to shoot for
7081419 while nvidia has not had the benefit of having someone to be shooting after
7081420 ati did not spend on things like physx and cuda but we believe that people value things beyond graphics if you compare only on graphics thats a relative disadvantage to us but the notion of what you measure a gpu on will change and evolve
7081421 were forward looking and sometimes when someones forward looking they get a little bit ahead of the game and thats kind of where we are
7081422 joining both components on the same die doesnt buy you that much
7081423 its not like theres a real bottleneck there and every square millimeter you add to the die is a very expensive millimeter its an incremental expense not a linear function its cheaper to separate them
7081424 the class of buyer who buys that type of graphics isnt really buying graphics

7081613 certainly there are high expectations from the public from the new government we will fulfill their aspirations by working in objective and planned manner for which we have outlined a number of national priority issues
7081614 first and foremost is the protection of national sovereignty independence and territorial integrity if nepal does not exist then there is no meaning for anything else including the republic but we have to strengthen the national unity based on full equality among people from himal pahad terai and madhes
7081615 i want to extend full commitment towards modern democratic principles like multi party competition period elections rule of law
7081616 our attention will be concentrated on addressing socio economic issues such as poverty unemployment and so on we will work to bring about modern industrial economy for which private public partnership model will be followed
7081617 the industrial peace will be maintained by improving relations between labour and employers
7081618 taking the peace process to logical conclusion and writing constitution on time is the main task of this government
7081619 this government also has huge challenges we need the support and cooperation from army police administration international community and general public to meet the challenges
7081620 i appeal to nepali army armed police force nepal police national investigation department to forget the bitterness of the past and extend their support for national unity there will be no prejudices from our side
7081621 we will follow the panchasheel in building our relations with all the countries including our neighbours

7081642 en el momento en que la pol tica brit nica estaba tomando decisiones cruciales para el futuro de palestina los palestinos se encontraron a s mismos sin los grupos que hab an definido hasta entonces su sociedad que hab an modelado el movimiento nacional o que hab an sido los portavoces de sus asuntos locales e internacionales la dirigencia hab a comenzado un exilio que durar a hasta hoy

7081659 when i was a youth minister outside of st paul minnesota some years ago the local lore included a story of how post it notes were conceived during church one sunday a 3m engineer named arthur fry was singing in his church choir when the slips of paper he had used to mark the days hymns fell out causing him to fumble to find the right pages during the ho hum sermon that followed the choirs performance the idea dawned on him he could take an elastic copolymer adhesive developed by another scientist and turn it into a tacky bulletin board note that could easily be removed and even transferred to another surface this new idea of how to move from a polymer to a life changing product is i believe a helpful tale for religious communities today if the church synagogue temple and mosque do not talk about and utilize modern science in their religious life it will seep into our communities of faith anyway people will bring the science they know work with or learn about from popular media into the life of congregations one way or another

7081670 now anyone with an intention to disturb the democratic set up will have to think a thousand times before he takes any such step
7081671 whatever the case is with his own selfishness the evidence of an internationally superior american generosity is impressive beginning with the numbers on our charitable giving we give twice as much as the british per capita and according to the american magazine seven times as much as the germans and 14 times as much as the italians even in inflation adjusted dollars the amount given each year just keeps getting larger and meanwhile we do far more volunteer work than in other industrialized countries

7081709 james vaughan coming on completely turned the game and made all the difference bbecause he ran about and gave us an extra forward that we have not had
7081710 i put him on with 35 minutes to go and could have taken him off with 10 minutes to go because the boy has not played any football and he was not in the squad on friday
7081711 but after training yesterday i felt i had no choice but to take him in the party and he probably in a way won us the game and that is what we are missing
7081712 i think we hung in and we got something in the end but coming here with the team weve got is very difficult would i have taken a 2 1 win with any team yes i would have and with the team i put out today i definitely would have
7081713 in the main i thought the boys at the back did a good job coupled with the boys who played in front of them and the james vaughan change completely changed the game
7081714 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7081715 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7081716 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7081717 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7081718 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7081719 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

7081737 a ban on seller funded down payment assistance programs will kick in october 1 when the new housing bill takes effect critics say the programs which basically allow sellers to pay for a buyers down payment artificially inflate home prices supporters say they are the best way to get a buyer into a home
7081738 we have to get the loan figured out before the 1st of october because thats when the ameridream program ends said david mills
7081739 david and his wife julie have four kids and are expecting a fifth they are looking for a home after learning the home they have been renting is about to go to the auction block in october
7081740 it took two months to look for a home but according to their re max realtor danielle martinez it only took about a week to sign a contract and make a deal
7081741 martinez said we are advising our sellers to be as aggressive now with pricing to make sure we get the buyers in because we basically need to have them in escrow with in the next week to close by september 30
7081742 david added i hope it all works out because when you buy a house youre pretty well stuck with it
7081743 a hot program responsible for a big chunk of home sales is about to disappear the down payment assistance program was the last zero down program available for people looking to buy a home but a new housing bill eliminated the program which had sellers donate the downpayment to a charity which then passed it on to the buyer
7081744 the program was supposed to end oct 1 but valley mortgage broker dean wegner said its happening sooner
7081745 wegner said 30 to 40 percent of all home sales have used down payment assistance uncertainty about the future of mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac is responsible for banks getting out of the program fast wegner said
7081746 the banks are pulling out six to seven weeks ahead of huds announcements because they are furious that if they go to sell it a mortgage to the fha the fhas not going to buy it and theyre going to get stuck with a loan that is totally unsellable to anybody he said
7081747 the median sales price for an existing single family in washoe county in july was 251 000 a 5 percent decrease from june and down 22 percent from july 2007
7081748 washoe county reported 386 existing single family home sales in july an increase of 6 percent from the previous month and up 31 percent from the same period last year besides increased affordability due to lower median prices the uptick in sales is also likely the result of buyers trying to get in before key changes from the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 take effect this october said ken wiseman broker owner of reno rancho realty
7081749 one change will close the loophole that allowed down payment assistance programs such as nehemiah and ameridream to be used with federal housing administration or fha loans wiseman said the programs basically make it possible for home sellers to indirectly contribute the 3 percent down payment required by the fha to home buyers
7081750 the changes combined with the fact that they will take effect in a month when housing sales traditionally start to slow could have a negative impact on home sales in october wiseman said but they are also spurring more sales now
7081751 word is out on the street now that if youre looking to do an fha loan with down payment assistance you better hurry up wiseman said
7081752 the clock is ticking on the popular no money down
7081753 nonprofit gift assistance is a critical safety net for working americans they say including more than 15 000 minnesota homebuyers estimated to have gotten their down payments through just one such group nehemiah corp of america
7081754 its a program thats really for the little people said scott syphax president of sacramento calif based nehemiah one of the largest down payment assistance charities
7081755 the fha criticizes the deals as circular financing schemes that can take advantage of vulnerable homeowners and claims the loans default much more frequently
7081756 seller funded down payment programs are almost exclusively used with fha insured home loans the gift is money provided by so called charities working with home sellers not gifts from relatives or public agencies the nonprofit essentially forwards money for the down payment from the seller to the buyer via a donation the seller makes to the nonprofit
7081757 the nonprofit pockets a fee typically about 400 the seller unloads a property the buyer gets into a home with no money out of pocket
7081758 such deals took off in the twin cities in the past few years as other subprime loan products fell by the wayside said chris galler chief operating officer of edina based minnesota association of realtors agents are reluctant to let go of any option for borrowers given the shrinking bag of mortgage tools available galler said but they realize its best for homeowners to have skin in the game and generally support the ban
7081759 long term we would say its the right thing for the marketplace galler said
7081760 to patti mazzara thats an understatement mazzara a mortgage broker in edina said she anticipates fallout from the ban as would be buyers get cut off from a market sinking in excess inventory there is a real need for 100 percent financing mazzara said because it is so difficult for many working class people to save for down payments at todays higher home prices
7081761 these are still proven qualified homebuyers were not pushing people who have bad credit mazzara said
7081762 her clients aaron and amanda swanson are buying a 132 000 split level in big lake with an fha insured mortgage and 7 920 from nehemiah for the 6 percent down payment amanda 27 is a stay at home mom while her husband works in a machine shop making steel tubing they rent a townhome in coon rapids and simply couldnt save enough for a down payment she said
7081763 amanda said shes never owned a home and has always wanted the security we never lived in a house that was ours she said for my daughters sake i wanted something she could live in and stay in and have as her own
7081764 ive told everybody i can to try to get a house if they want a house before october 1 she added
7081765 the fha has made it clear the charity programs are a problem
7081766 studies have shown that some sellers stick the extra gift down payment onto the end of the loan increasing the price and loan amount meaning buyers pay for it over the life of the loan
7081767 the irs ruled in 2006 that the specialized groups dont qualify as tax exempt charities when they are paid by sellers to simply funnel money from seller to buyer in a self serving circular loop since then the irs has revoked the tax exempt status of more than two dozen nonprofit down payment assistance groups
7081768 the average down payment gift is about 4 500 syphax said which works out to about 20 a month
7081769 qualified buyers who act quickly can move into a new legacy home with no out of pocket expenses at lakes at lost creek
7081770 lakes at lost creek features legacy homes priced from the 130s to the 170s and meritage homes priced from the 170s to the 200s home sizes range from approximately 1 550 to 3 000 square feet
7081771 the zero down payment promotion is available only on completed homes buyers who prefer to build from the ground up can receive a dream package valued up to 20 000 buyers who contract by sept 15 to build a new legacy or meritage home at lakes at lost creek will receive popular designer features
7081772 known as seller funded down payment assistance builders could pay up to 6 percent of a homes sale price the ban is a near term negative for the industry since it will shrink the pool of potential buyers raise cancellation rates and weigh on already depressed builders shares
7081773 the chief executive of the largest u s home builder d r horton inc said he got suicidal over the ban
7081774 while the new law contains a 7 500 tax credit for first time buyers that will not offset the ban on down payment assistance which had no such restrictions national association of home builders ceo jerry howard said
7081775 whats more builders had come to rely increasingly on down payment assistance as the credit crunch forced more buyers into the very government mortgages affected by the ban morningstar analyst eric landry said
7081776 assisted down payments secure about a third of the federal housing authoritys portfolio today up from 18 percent five years ago said housing and urban development spokesman lemar wooley
7081777 in reducing the number of potential buyers whether or not they could afford down payments the ban could cause another leg down for builders by depressing home prices further and forcing them to write off the value of more land jp morgan analyst michael rehaut said on a conference call for clients
7081778 also cancellation rates could rise because agreements to buy homes struck before october 1 could see any assistance invalidated by a routine credit recheck after that date said bill renner nahbs director of single family finance
7081779 builders such as horton and centex corp which both target first time buyers will especially feel the loss because more of their customers need either financial help or a government backed loan or both
7081780 horton assisted 21 percent of buyers in its latest quarter up from 7 percent in all of fiscal 2007 while centex assisted buyers in a quarter of closings lennar corp tops the big builders with about a third of its closings using down payment assistance in the second quarter spokesman scott shipley said
7081781 even luxury builder toll brothers inc which does not offer down payment assistance dpa will be hurt as owners struggle to trade up ceo bob toll said on a conference call we would expect that the whole daisy chain of the market will be impacted to some extent he said
7081782 we have to get the loan figured out before the 1st of october because thats when the ameridream program ends said david mills
7081783 i posted a quote from a uhs south of the bay area in ca a few weeks ago stating this would eliminate 80 90 of current buyers
7081784 a hot program responsible for a big chunk of home sales is about to disappear the down payment assistance program was the last zero down program available for people looking to buy a home but a new housing bill eliminated the program which had sellers donate the downpayment to a charity which then passed it on to the buyer
7081785 if you dont have 20 down or need down payment assistance then you dont need to be buying a house
7081786 critics say the programs which basically allow sellers to pay for a buyers down payment artificially inflate home prices
7081787 supporters say they are the best way to get a buyer into a home
7081788 the fha criticizes the deals as circular financing schemes that can take advantage of vulnerable homeowners and claims
7081789 these are still proven qualified homebuyers were not pushing people who have bad credit mazzara said
7081790 her clients aaron and amanda swanson are buying a 132 000 split level in big lake with an fha insured mortgage and 7 920 from nehemiah for the 6 percent down payment amanda 27 is a stay at home mom while her husband works in a machine shop making steel tubing they rent a townhome in coon rapids and simply couldnt save enough for a down payment she said

7081795 the opposition party has assured us before that there will not be any untoward situation during the agitation

7081800 as long as there is uncertainty over treasurys plan we cant raise money and as long as we cant raise money theres going to be more and more speculation about treasurys plan
7081801 you would have to be insane to invest in these companies right now and weve basically told them that
7081802 when treasury comes in they are guaranteed to get a better deal than us which would push down the value of our investment so why would we ever invest before we know what treasury is going to do
7081803 any investor stepping in will need certainty around the financing and leverage of their equity
7081804 given recent market movement moodys believes these firms currently have limited access to common and preferred equity capital at economically attractive terms
7081805 the institutions are too big to fail and the government needs them operating
7081806 its the only part of the mortgage market thats even remotely working right now
7081807 at the end of the day probably the u s governments going to come in
7081808 i wouldnt want to be a preferred share owner or a common stock owner but if you own the debt or the mbs youre going to be okay
7081809 its a very cheap call on the notion of these guys surviving and if they do itll be a multi bagger payoff
7081810 our management has been talking with a variety of potential investors this week
7081811 most parties would look at it as the u s government stepping in and guaranteeing the obligations of fannie and freddie
7081812 assuming that these securities are relatively well dispersed among the banking system our view is that this should be a manageable exposure for most banks
7081813 puts a little more pressure on banks to record some sort of impairment charge on these securities
7081814 the more and more likely it becomes that the value of these isnt going to return back to where it was
7081815 as weve been saying we maintain the highest capital rating from our regulator a strong liquidity position and continued access to the debt markets at attractive spreads
7081816 we are also pleased that moodys has affirmed our long term short term and subordinated debt ratings
7081817 its more difficult for the government to explain the rationale for supporting a form of equity holder such as preferred stock
7081818 senior management has been talking with a wide array of possible investors this week
7081819 it seems a foregone conclusion that shareholders are going to be wiped out
7081820 theres a real urgency in that all of the progress we have made on these new vehicles could come to a standstill if we cant get capital at reasonable rates
7081821 this is actually more like the government acting like a banker as it begins to look at the major consequences of a major failure in the auto industry
7081822 providing additional assistance to the companies in future years to ensure that advanced fuel efficient vehicles will be made here in the u s
7081823 our auto companies are rising to the challenge of building the next generation of american cars but are doing so in times when credit conditions cripple the funding for the facilities and technologies to take the steps to the future
7081824 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
7081825 congress created this program and were quite hopeful they will fund the program now so they can assist us in our transformation of company to producing more advanced technology vehicles
7081826 next year is going to be a make or break year in terms of survival
7081827 any help like these government loans would be a huge boost
7081828 our plans which require significant investments are at risk because of limited access to capital
7081829 this program will open capital that is necessary to make sure our transformational plans continue at full speed and give us the best chance to succeed
7081830 the priority is to get the appropriation that has already been approved
7081831 conversations as to why or how we should expand that amount are ongoing
7081832 our auto companies are rising to the challenge building the next generation of american cars but are doing so in times when credit conditions cripple the funding for the facilities and technologies to take the steps to the future
7081833 we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
7081834 this is a horrible idea another transfer of funds to failed ventures
7081835 if this were a good idea the market would price the debt accordingly and give them the money
7081836 weve seen these kinds of bailouts for the financial companies why not the automakers
7081837 the big problem is that a lot of people in washington dont see a value in the u s auto industry because they have a foreign plant in their district that is doing just fine
7081838 there is no need for customers to change their banking relationship to retain their deposit insurance coverage
7081839 will not come close to repeating the experience of japan
7081840 key players would likely prefer to delay action until after the november elections if possible
7081841 would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country
7081842 mr syron was also warned that the firm needed to expand its capital cushion but instead its safety net shrank mr syron was told to slow the firms mortgage purchases instead they accelerated

7081845 the need to maintain the corporations status as a private shareholder owned company
7081846 we think indymac under fdics watchful eye will interpret the mbs agreements more loosely and err on the side of modifications over other solutions including foreclosure
7081847 the reason it is beneficial for bondholders is were talking about delinquent loans loans where the borrowers not paying and were creating an obligation that now will continue to pay for the long term
7081848 it hurts the bondholders that are off any shelf of any bank that is perceived as weak and potentially seizure bait because the collateral is now in question
7081849 weve talked to mbs investors weve talked to trustees on deals and they want to monitor how we perform as i would expect them to
7081850 our banking is sub sub sub sub prime you cant get any lower than us we have no collateral no insurance no taxpayer guarantees and no lawyers in our system
7081851 yet we have a loan repayment rate of over 98pc
7081852 the worlds big banks had all the collateral all the guarantees all the lawyers and what did they do they sent us a 1 trillion bill
7081853 we send our people out on bicycles to check if they are poor enough if a woman lives in a one room house she qualifies if she has a leaky roof she qualifies we even give loans to beggars this is risky
7081854 the banks gave the impression that they were almost perfect and then we find there is a fundamental flaw in the structure of the system
7081855 we dont seem to be accusing anybody over this whole debacle it is as if nobody is responsible we can all go off and play golf the taxpayer will take care of the problem when things go well the bankers take the profit and when it goes wrong they are compensated this is not symmetrical
7081856 the next thing we are going to see is a micro finance bubble the players are becoming bigger and bigger weve now got hedge funds and mutual funds going around saying this is a wonderful idea you can make so much money and help people at the same time its intoxicating
7081857 we dont like them this is an abuse of the whole philosophy of micro finance
7081858 this is about getting people out of poverty it is a non loss non dividend company with a social objective it is totally de linked from the profit system
7081859 women have a feature of self sacrifice for the family that you see all over the world men like to spend
7081860 the extreme right religious groups accused us of destroying the social order by giving loans to women we were encouraging them to disobey their husbands they were using religion for what was really a male issue
7081861 there is nothing in the koran against women being in business
7081862 the left didnt like us either they said this was an american conspiracy to spread capitalism at the grass roots level so we were squeezed from all sides let them all scream the revolutionaries are all talk and do nothing
7081863 we sell in the cheapest possible way with no frills hoping that enough of it will reach poor children
7081864 so far 11 000 have stopped begging completely and the other 90 000 are now part time beggars they know when to sell and which houses are a soft touch for begging this is good market segmentation it takes time to close down a core business
7081865 i believe all people are entrepreneurs poverty is not inherent it is artificially imposed by the denial of opportunities
7081866 one day we will create poverty museums we will take the next generation of children to show them what it used to be like and they wont be able to believe it there is no need for anybody to be poor
7081867 financial entities like banks broker dealers regional banks finance companies and insurance companies need credit at reasonable rates in order to finance themselves
7081868 for many regional banks like keycorp zions regions and national city the door has already shut on them if they wanted to raise capital in the debt market at levels where their outstanding issues regularly trade they would have to pay 12 15 hardly economic levels
7081869 then there are the good banks like j p morgan and wells fargo j p morgan recently sold 600 million of preferred stock at 8 3 4 and wells fargo sold 1 3 billion at 8 5 8 plus underwriting fees

7081871 rf regions financial needs to raise 2 billion says sanford bernstein lets see what are their options they can sell debt the problem here is that you couldnt sell debt if you wanted the last reported trade in rf paper was 2 weeks ago nearly 700 to the 30 year or close to 12 their preferreds trade at 10 and the stock is now a single digit midget near 8 a share so if you could even get a deal done shareholders would get a 50 haircut

7081885 pentru noi este un meci foarte greu nt lnim liderul o echip n form ns cred c putem s nvingem cred c gabriel paraschiv este cel mai periculos juc tor din liga i i trebuie s fim foarte aten i la el dar nu trebuie s i neglij m nici pe ceilal i juc tori ai o elului este foarte important faptul c vin i spectatorii pentru c noi de la meciul cu steaua n am mai jucat cu suporteri i vom fi i mai motiva i

7081889 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
7081890 health care workers should not be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
7081891 in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
7081892 participating in any activity with a reasonable connection to the objectionable procedure including referrals training and other arrangements for offending procedures
7081893 poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
7081894 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity
7081895 we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important
7081896 ce que nous avons vu ici est que sur un nouveau circuit certaines quipes ont travaill dans la bonne direction et dautres non
7081897 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7081898 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7081899 so what do you plan to do with your degree

7081906 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7081907 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7081908 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7081909 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7081910 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7081911 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7081912 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7081913 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7081914 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7081915 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy

7081918 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7081919 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7081920 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7081921 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7081922 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7081923 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe

7081942 without devotion to the blessed sacrament people quickly lose eucharistic faith
7081943 who could claim that he has a right to receive the body of christ this is all an act of gods immeasurable love our lord makes himself available to us in his body and blood for holy communion but we can never say that we have the right to him that we can demand to receive our lord in holy communion each time we approach we should approach with a profound sense of our own unworthiness
7081944 it is the greatest act of charity to prevent somebody from doing something that is sacrilegious that is to warn them and then actually refuse to be party to a sacrilege the church in her love prevents people from doing things that are gravely offensive to god and gravely damaging to their own souls
7081945 we have to be the one to monitor the situation and discipline ourselves not to approach to receive holy communion
7081946 the minister of holy communion has the obligation to refuse holy communion to that person
7081947 an attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil
7081948 people would be led to think it is alright to be in the state of mortal sin and to receive our lord in holy communion
7081949 that the public act which this person is committing which everyone thinks is a serious sin must not be so serious because the church permits that person to receive holy communion
7081950 conscience is not some sort of subjective reality where i make up for myself what is right and good rather it is an objective reality where i conform my own thinking to what is true
7081951 the first thing that needs to be said is that the body and blood of christ is a gift of gods love to us it is the greatest gift a gift beyond our ability to describe
7081952 a gift is freely given out of love and that is what god is doing for us every time we are able to participate in mass and approach to receive holy communion
7081953 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk

7081969 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7081970 but the united states and russia still have many thousands of nuclear weapons and each keeps more than a thousand on hair trigger alert ready to launch within a matter of minutes
7081971 we need a public debate about us nuclear weapons policy and thats why we developed these ads

7082004 it has been a blessing for me to be out on this court
7082005 i havent necessarily played great during this tournament tonight i got into some foul trouble as did diana taurasi and katie smith but we fought hard and we beat australia
7082006 we are all god playing hide and seek with himself
7082007 we still live in the country that was built by ivan the terrible
7082008 people like putin they have no other idea of how to rule
7082009 what russia does now it cannot be analyzed with modern political logic it is obsolete if modern countries like the u s declare war they have more or less rational reasons even if they are mistaken
7082010 you shouldnt expect logic from a kgb lieutenant colonel anyway you shouldnt expect modern political thinking
7082011 russia is a big and capable country which will not let the west dictate the conditions
7082012 in any situation russia is going to act as it sees fit
7082013 russia has never been conquered not in 1 000 years though many tried
7082014 its because its in our genes not to allow anyone to dictate the conditions how to act where to act
7082015 theyve realized that if russia merely plays the role the west has made for it we would quickly become a country that protects the pipeline sending gas and oil from western siberia
7082016 it is too early to bury russia as a great power
7082017 what makes the situation even more difficult is that all these small nations which existed between russia and the heart of europe they have rushed to join europe
7082018 i wanted to make music that lasts awhile to make an album that people can enjoy for a lot longer than one month
7082019 i hope the pleasure in listening to the results is commensurate with the pleasure we had during the process
7082020 i dont think he changes at all if anything the standard is maybe higher for this season
7082021 when thatll hit me a little bit will be at the end i think i will admit to the fact that ive had a little talk with myself about that and that doesnt help anybody if im thinking that
7082022 so no at the end therell be some time im sure that ill think about that but now this is a new year im the same person my staff clearly understands that the players understand it business as usual
7082023 he is very demanding and sets the bar high if you reach his standards then you are great then he is happy and in a good mood
7082024 if you dont reach his standard then he is cranky and not happy and he will let you know
7082025 he knows the team we have and what we can do hes always been specific hes even more so now
7082026 hes trying to make this his best year of coaching i really believe that and hes indicated that to us
7082027 weve been close the last couple years and havent been able to finish the deal
7082028 and now its up to all of us to really work very very hard and do the best job we can do as coaches and players

7082035 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7082036 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7082037 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things

7082041 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7082042 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7082043 it creates a troubling perception when washington policymakers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line
7082044 market participants failed to soundly manage measure and disclose risks with ignorance greed or hubris playing their customary roles
7082045 the alarms of the financial sector have been overstated the real economy has slowed down but is not yet in severe difficulty
7082046 we were recently informed that brainstorm have cancelled all their live activities for the rest of 2008 and this means that they wont be doing the dates in france and spain with us

7082052 we have to keep our concentration and begin by winning a match against a great team at home we are obliged to do things right
7082053 i started great i played well i was aggressive i had a chance early in the second set to put him away but it didn t happen
7082054 in the final set i got back to my fundamentals
7082055 i ve never been higher than the number three american i ve spent my entire career being that next guy
7082056 i have spent my academic career so far at oswego and it is my home so i do not consider leaving lightly at the same time i am honored to be considered by old dominion stanley said the presidential search at odu allows me to explore a wonderful opportunity but does not affect the exemplary work that continues on at oswego

7082058 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate
7082059 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden

7082084 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7082085 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time

7082096 senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7082097 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7082098 we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president
7082099 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7082100 obama has spent millions on his change message in indiana biden has held onto a seat in the senate since 1972 how does that represent change
7082101 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century
7082102 he biden has distinguished himself as a member of the united states senate and is an accomplished public servant i wish him well in his bid for higher office but remain a supporter and ally of senator john mccain
7082103 in selecting senator joe biden as his running mate senator obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of
7082104 we see a lot of atv injuries weve been seeing them more as the economys been booming out here and were seeing them in all age groups not just young kids
7082105 people are going to start crying saying its a provincial regulation because its transportation related and we dont want the feds involved
7082106 yet youve got a patchwork framework across the country that is not only very confusing but is not based on any science whatsoever
7082107 its based on public opinion and its based on political lack of will to do anything about the issue
7082108 one of the things that we would like to see and were part of a national association is a little bit of standardization going on
7082109 the regulations are so fractured across this country its hard to keep track
7082110 we definitely need to pull this all together across the country
7082111 instead of saying these are dangerous vehicles or high risk vehicles so dont use them maybe we should be focusing on the vehicles themselves why are they high risk what can be done with them from a product safety point of view
7082112 the question i think has to be raised from a federal point of view from product safety are these safe recreational products

7082143 abbiamo vinto una gara difficile mi piaciuta molto la squadra nel secondo tempo perch siamo stati capaci di cambiare marcia aggredendo molto pi alti il modena padoin migliore in campo ha fatto cose molto buone ma nel complesso dopo lingresso di cigarini giocando con lui e ferreira pinto pi alti penso che la nostra spinta sia aumentata ed in parecchie occasioni il gol mancato davvero per poco la condizione generale buona domenica prossima con il siena si comincia anche in campionato dove il nostro obiettivo resta una salvezza tranquilla da centrare il prima possibile
7082144 sono molto contento devo lavorare ogni giorno per farmi trovare pronto quando il mister mi chiama il rapporto minuti giocati gol realizzati molto buono e vero sono al secondo gol ufficiale e spero di farne tanti altri ma anche oggi devo ringraziare floccari che mi ha dato davvero un assist doro adesso parto per lo stage con la nazionale under 20 spero che la chiamata non resti lunica perch ai prossimi mondiali voglio esserci
7082145 sono sereno e questo mi permette di esprimermi al meglio quando sono chiamato in causa dedico il gol a me stesso spero che sia un buon viatico per questa stagione in cui cercher di convincere la societ a riconfermarmi visto che sono in scadenza di contratto siamo in tanti e bisogna lavorare duro ogni giorno per meritare fiducia domenica con il siena inizia il campionato e dobbiamo partire forte sfruttando al meglio il calendario

7082174 being a part of this game on sunday is the biggest game for me ever i got to the nba finals and i thought that was pretty big but winning an nba championship will never compare to winning a gold medal for my country
7082175 we werent a team in 2004 just a bunch of individuals put on a basketball team we didnt have much time to prepare and we didnt take care of business and look at it like it was our last game every game we play it hurt us
7082176 im very excited the argentina game was the biggest game ive played in ive played in a championship game in the nba but the way i felt getting ready for this its the biggest game ive felt in my career
7082177 were very excited we know our job is not done yet weve all been in positions where weve been let down before so we know weve got a job to finish
7082178 we discussed for months and months whether it was a worthwhile thing given one of the goals was to get me to the olympics vince took a significant pay cut to sign a two year deal with canterbury rugby but he was willing to make that sacrifice to enable me to pursure my dreams
7082179 we paid 5000 out of our own pockets to bring our house contents from sydney to christchurch we relocated our entire lives only to find out oh my gosh what are we going to do were now effectively stuck there and theres nothing for me to do theres not even a womens national league in new zealand
7082180 people are putting in the hard yards making the effort relocating their lives for very little money and were talking very little money all for the love of the game this whole thing has done nothing but put us in more debt and now i dont even have a team to play for this season
7082181 im one of the older players but what are our younger players coming into nothing thats what
7082182 this is it for me i guess ive never come to a point in my life where i simply dont know what im doing right now theres no plan and im hoping some sort of miracle happens
7082183 a lot of us couldnt keep it in its gone above basketball now its about our livelihood it feels like youre homeless
7082184 im angry and disappointed but it runs deeper than that this affects me differently because im a mother and ive already sacrificed so much
7082185 we havent heard from the ceo since weve been here there needs to be some accountability the players deserve answers and we need some certainty around the tall ferns programme
7082186 you get your yellow slip while youre away on olympic duty the timing of the release was pretty devastating some of these girls may never play basketball again thats the part that worries me
7082187 that has been the hardest part of this whole saga the fact that the players have been on the other side of the world competing in the biggest event of their lives while at home their team was crumbling
7082188 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7082189 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7082190 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7082191 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7082192 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7082193 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7082194 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7082195 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7082196 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7082197 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7082198 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7082199 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7082200 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7082201 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7082202 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7082203 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7082204 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7082205 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7082206 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7082207 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7082208 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7082209 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7082210 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7082211 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7082212 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7082213 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7082214 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7082215 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7082216 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7082217 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7082218 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7082219 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7082220 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7082221 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7082222 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7082223 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7082224 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7082225 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7082226 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7082227 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7082228 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7082229 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7082230 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7082231 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7082232 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7082233 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7082234 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7082235 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7082236 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7082237 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7082238 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7082239 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7082240 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7082241 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7082242 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7082243 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7082244 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7082245 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7082246 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7082247 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7082248 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7082249 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7082250 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7082251 who are open to doing something on the production side
7082252 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7082253 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7082254 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7082255 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7082256 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7082257 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7082258 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7082259 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7082260 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7082261 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7082262 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7082263 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7082264 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7082265 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7082266 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7082267 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7082268 what is wrong with these people why do they keep coming back
7082269 all in all the citizens of the united states of america and indeed people around the world can be proud of our team
7082270 linverno finito ora sento cantare guarda in alto il sole tornato a brillare
7082271 as soon as i dropped the camera i looked around everywhere and there was nothing in the sky
7082272 it was miles and miles away and as big as a football
7082273 it wasnt there when i took the camera away from my eye but it was there when i took the photo
7082274 you dont want to think you are crazy and i dont want to be one of those crazies but i thought being near wycliffe well who knows what it is
7082275 ive been in military and intelligence circles who know that beneath the surface of what has been public knowledge yes we have been visited reading the papers recently its been happening quite a bit
7082276 it s fun to try to find a pair that actually fits
7082277 as far as the older baggers are concerned we have been there and done that already so we are more dedicated to doing a good job for our customers we know that no customer has to tip us however we appreciate it when they do
7082278 i would like all commissary customers who use a bagger especially an older one to know that most of us have served our time for you and our country and many of us are financially secure
7082279 we have several major reasons for wanting to bag your groceries
7082280 you younger customers are at that stage of feeling invulnerable so seeing an old retiree hunched over walking a little slow poor posture maybe limping a little out of breath or one who didn t understand what you said the first time take a second and try to guess his or her age
7082281 our shuffling gait keeps that asphalt or cement parking lot nice and flat what you see in us is a preview of coming attractions for yourselves just wanted you to know that we are a part of the military family and are proud of it
7082282 for all the older baggers we appreciate you letting us serve you
7082283 this is very special for myself and also for my country i did what i dreamed before
7082284 my plan was to pick up the pace very fast
7082285 at that time maybe im so young myself and i made some mistakes
7082286 now im very strong and thinking more about the race
7082287 shopping on base is better for those with smaller children than with teenagers the military exchange has most of what people need if they re not too particular with what they buy
7082288 for the kids that are going to grow a few inches in a year shopping in the u s or online provides a better selection for size and for what they want to wear it s also cheaper than in the exchange we spent 9 on a pair of shorts in the states and saw the same item in the exchange for 40
7082289 they have good stuff at the exchange but not a lot of selection everyone here walks around looking like twins

7082296 what russia does now it cannot be analyzed with modern political logic it is obsolete if modern countries like the u s declare war they have more or less rational reasons even if they are mistaken
7082297 you shouldnt expect logic from a kgb lieutenant colonel anyway you shouldnt expect modern political thinking
7082298 russia is a big and capable country which will not let the west dictate the conditions
7082299 in any situation russia is going to act as it sees fit
7082300 russia has never been conquered not in 1 000 years though many tried
7082301 its because its in our genes not to allow anyone to dictate the conditions how to act where to act
7082302 theyve realized that if russia merely plays the role the west has made for it we would quickly become a country that protects the pipeline sending gas and oil from
7082303 it is too early to bury russia as a great power
7082304 what makes the situation even more difficult is that all these small nations which existed between russia and the heart of europe they have rushed to join europe

7082343 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7082344 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7082345 it creates a troubling perception when washington policymakers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line

7082419 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
7082420 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
7082421 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
7082422 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
7082423 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7082424 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7082425 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
7082426 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7082427 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7082428 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7082429 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7082430 the iraqi government wants this agreement to be valid just for three years
7082431 the full withdrawal will depend on the situation on the ground and the needs of iraqis and the decisions of the iraqi government
7082432 the war against terrorism is our own war and it will continue until its logical end
7082433 during the summer of 2006 there were no attacks on ships at all
7082434 reasonable enough to see that it does them no good to coddle these criminals

7082437 a direct challenge to the us dominated post cold war international order
7082438 we understand the russian stance and the russian military response as a result of the provocations which took place we appreciate the courageous decision taken by the russian leadership in responding to the international initiatives and the start of withdrawing its forces
7082439 will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic demarches
7082440 its that chasm that lies between knowing something and doing something about it
7082441 judging by the conduct of mr tsvangirai i have no doubt that zimbabweans are a determined people
7082442 but daddy how would we be heard by the world if we do not speak in english
7082443 the fighting that is still raging has so far left 12 militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7082444 they wanted provocation at sea but they wont get it
7082445 no matter what happens we have already achieved our goal by proving that ordinary citizens with ordinary means can mobilise a defence of human rights for palestinians
7082446 we want people to see the palestinian problem as one of human rights not feeding them rice
7082447 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7082448 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7082449 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7082450 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7082451 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7082452 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7082453 georgia is not a member of this organization so the troops must leave very quickly
7082454 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7082455 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7082456 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7082457 amid the controversies of the ministerial hierarchy the cpn uml will stay out of the government
7082458 we have not said we wont accept cpn uml leader in the second position in the protocol ranking we are ready to show flexibility regarding this

7082493 her fear of black men who passed by her on the street
7082494 where decency and endurance and the pioneer spirit were joined at the hip with conformity and suspicion and the potential for unblinking cruelty
7082495 but that was the age difference and not that she was mean or anything

7082511 before you came in she told me the fella was black thats the real reason why shes bothered
7082512 never had they given me reason to doubt their love i doubted if they ever would
7082513 and yet i knew that men who might easily have been my brothers could still inspire their rawest fears
7082514 than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe
7082515 she was really a very liberal person liberal in politics and i think liberal in thinking
7082516 frankly that story when it was in the book i felt didnt need to be in there

7082522 would never retain a player against his wishes so we have no alternative to accept the unilateral rescinding of his contract
7082523 he can leave as early as possible but he must accept the consequences of rescinding a contract which has two years to run

7082904 in any situation russia is going to act as it sees fit

7082976 hallmark is jeopardizing its brand as a family friendly company
7082977 customers used to be able to trust hallmark to produce quality products that were safe for all ages
7082978 now parents will need to steer their kids from hallmarks section of the greeting card aisle and away from its previously heart warming movies for fear that they too will push homosexual messages
7082979 by latching onto the latest fad generated by the homosexual special interest groups hallmark is negating its image as a wholesome company that promotes american values and pro family principles in its products
7082980 american businesses have a corporate responsibility to the public that buys their products
7082981 instead of bolstering campaigns by special interest groups like the homosexual activists corporations like hallmark should be protecting american culture from those forces that would destroy the family and create a public environment that is detrimental to general well being especially childrens well being

7082983 the public will rightly ask how this government can claim to be taking data security seriously when the number of breaches at the revenue has actually increased following the lost discs fiasco
7082984 it is particularly disappointing that the hmrc breaches have not prevented other unacceptable security breaches from occurring
7082985 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
7082986 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times

7082993 we are able to pick up the disease knowing their patients family history and we can also be proactive in even preventing the person from getting potential chronic diseases

7083002 all the doncaster branches of the legion are disgusted that there will not be a veterans day parade
7083003 the council do not seem to care about the achievements of servicemen and women
7083004 i am not homophobic but the council supported both doncaster pride and the mayors civic parade
7083005 one of our legion members spoke to an official at the civic offices who told him we couldnt have a parade this year because the council did not have the amenities
7083006 i rang the official and she effectively told me the police couldnt afford the staff to block off the roads
7083007 its crazy i went on the parade last year and only saw two community bobbies stopping the traffic
7083008 it is not a matter of finance or the council not wanting to do it
7083009 the police look into the number of parades being held and give the go ahead on a case by case basis
7083010 we are quite happy to hold the veterans parade provided the police are happy
7083011 each request is assessed on an individual basis we have not received a request this year about the veterans day parade

7083212 humourous grumbling about slavery that seems subversive but ultimately reinscribes its necessity in the national delusion

7083219 there are 6 major wounds in his body two on his chest on the abdomen and on the face all these clearly indicate that he was brutally murdered
7083220 if he obama is going to pick joe biden he obama might as well pick hillary clinton her and her husbands color aroused comments are just about the same as biden
7083221 if anything we can thank joe biden for being instrumental in preventing nutjob conservative robert bork from being on the supreme court
7083222 back in february i had a contest to see who could give me a reasonable argument for a vp candidate kyle won the contest and i published his comment we had many candidates including senator joe biden i didnt think that joe biden would be a good pick at the time because he didnt bring a lot including the very small state of delaware but after talking with princeton political guru melissa harris lacewell i became more of a biden supporter

7083228 this shows his lack of confidence that he is really ready to be president that he is not really committed to change
7083229 laat ik een dagboek kopen en al mijn gedachten erin schrijven
7083230 h hoezo dag boek waarom niet een denk boek of opschrijf boek of zoiets
7083231 we love listening to other people talk stuff about us
7083232 it just fuels us to be ready and we dont say anything until its over when you see it in the pictures thats when we start celebrating when we win
7083233 then they came for the trade unionists and i did not speak out because i was not a trade unionist then they came for the jews and i did not speak out because i was not a jew then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me
7083234 he is too open just way too expressive for me
7083235 every night when we arrive home from work it starts out perfect cordial small talk light petting maybe even casual foreplay and then usually one of us takes the lead in the kitchen but soon enough out comes the wine and he insists on opening up and discussing his emotions it sucks the life right out of me and i usually go out
7083236 i dont want to hear about his new mercedes his work day sexual proclivities or his athletes foot
7083237 i want impenetrability its a respected sign of masculinity and i dont think im unique in wanting just sex and some vague non committal companionship and even then sometimes i feel id rather be alone
7083238 back in the early 2000s we seemed to stress the principles of open conversation
7083239 then these kinds of problems would be considered preposterous but with the majority of couples now meeting online couples find it increasingly difficult to make the formerly natural transcendence from virtual communication into real time dynamics nowadays with verbal conversation widely considered taboo its increasingly difficult for men men are taught to be highly communicative open and direct but they dont realise thats totally unnecessary with most relationships just look at jazz singer victoria beachamp and her husband derby county coach david beachamp ten years ago at the height of their celebrity status they split up because they were both intense conversationalists babbling away at spurious inanities without really communicating anything as such their relationship went the way of many couples but fortunately their diligence and mental acuity has paid off with luck they reinvented themselves and reunited today they hardly talk with each other and as such enjoy a loving rewarding relationship
7083240 for many couples facing cdd communicative displacement disorder not so ironically communication to resolve the issue is near impossible
7083241 typically i suggest going back to the roots of the relationship chatting online using email and the like as devices with which to build common denominators again and reaffirm what it was they liked about each other
7083242 at least we wouldnt have been able to come back to the u s there would be suspensions
7083243 they wont do anything to them its a double standard
7083244 the prevailing notion is that public schools are bad because they are public that private education is good because its private and that the privatization of schools will get rid of a union that removes bad teachers
7083245 what new orleanians lost after katrina in terms of schools is the right to make their own decisions this is now a market system explicitly it changes the paradigm it is now less about community and more about a consumer based individual escape model whats been lost is the sense of public education as a community institution it is now endemic across the country these market based reforms
7083246 we dont want to have anything with the rsd schools i went there and was an honors student and when i got to uno i hadnt seen half the stuff up there i dont want to go to the same schools i dont want the same education a large part of the population doesnt care whether kids are educated well or not
7083247 only in new orleans is public education a bad word
7083248 why isnt there a sub board under the board that is different from the status quo which is bad
7083249 the only thing that sets me apart from my friends who are incarcerated or deceased are my parents those parents are isolated they wont know that we had a conference here today whats going on in the times picayune go to these parents and ask what we can do to help until as a city we get to the point of thinking as a whole
7083250 more so than test scores we need to socialize these kids whats the point of high test scores when theyre kicking in your door
7083251 i cant imagine what its like for a mother who reads at a fourth grade education what the bloggers can do is ask yourself about adult education in your neighborhood write about it and talk to your politicians about it adult education gets forgotten they keep running to me at the library and im strapped
7083252 presence of all refugees migrants from other provinces and countries
7083253 creo que dada la coyuntura hist rica del juicio a fujimori no era lo m s conveniente que una comisi n tan importante como es la de acusaciones constitucionales estuviera en manos de una conspicua representante del fujimorismo es un proceso hist rico el proceso del siglo y obviamente no puedo dejar de expresar el sentir de la mayor a del poder judicial por lo que se est comentando conf o en la calidad profesional del rgano jurisdiccional que tiene a cargo dicho juicio estamos preparados para resistir cualquier tipo de presi n adem s conozco a la se ora moyano tiene sus cualidades y espero que no utilice ning n mecanismo de presi n

7083257 the money is clean it does not need to be laundered
7083258 i will not avoid my responsibilities but the situation is not how it has been portrayed by the media
7083259 its like in the old days when a government official who made a mistake would not only be killed but his entire clan as well
7083260 the political persecution i get is like what happened during chinas cultural revolution i hope if i fall there will be 10 more who stand up and that if those 10 fall 100 more will take their place
7083261 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7083262 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7083263 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7083264 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7083265 im in favor of another agreement whatever it takes to stop the conflict but you know it just cannot have as a tradeoff the criminals going scott free
7083266 they the milf must show good faith to try to stop the conflict from escalating and that good faith is to surrender the two who perpetrated these atrocities and stop condoning it at least if not encouraging
7083267 war is among the options it is part of the struggle the milf is determined to continue that struggle
7083268 reduce the amount of trash because tissues disintegrate in water
7083269 with an 18 percent connection rate of taiwans buildings to the underground sewage pipes more than 60 percent of homes still rely on septic tanks to process sewage
7083270 however tissue paper in septic tanks increases the pollution density of the waste and in turn worsens the overall water quality of rivers where waste in septic tanks end up
7083271 seventy six people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred
7083272 19 women seven men and the rest children all under 15 years of age
7083273 coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives an investigation has been directed
7083274 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7083275 martyring at least 70 people most of them women and children
7083276 all efforts by the government to seek the prevention of civilian casualties have not yet brought a fruitful conclusion and our civilians are victims of anti terrorist operations
7083277 all militias were driven out and the town is now controlled by the islamists
7083278 a tactical withdrawal to avoid a large number of civilian casualties
7083279 there is no complete takeover and our forces will regain control of kismayo in a very short time
7083280 we buried around 12 dead bodies this morning and some of them were unidentified civilians caught in the crossfire
7083281 we had warned the government we would target police and the army if it didnt stop operations against us in swat
7083282 a reinforcement of links between damascus and moscow amounts to a very negative development
7083283 it would push syria to adopt an irresponsible and adventurist policy
7083284 we are obviously very concerned about reports that russia may be providing weapons weapons systems to syria
7083285 would endanger peace in the world not only in the middle east
7083286 forceful return on the international stage doesnt guarantee in any way it will have a constructive role in the future of the middle east
7083287 it is difficult to believe in the good faith of moscow when it emerges despite all of moscows denials that russian weapons sold to syria have reached hezbollah
7083288 the government accepts that our policies must evolve to remain relevant in the current media landscape it is no longer realistic to disallow all forms of party political films
7083289 however political commercials and films that are dramatized and made to distort issues or create a slanted impression should not be allowed
7083290 my reaction is to re submit my two banned films for reappraisal to test whether the pms pronouncements are for real
7083291 theres lots of skepticism and a wait and see attitude judging from the blogs
7083292 directly wrote articles edited and approved without checking sources news and articles with seriously untrue information concerning the pmu18 case
7083293 paying the price for his news on a matter that is not yet over but which unravels in a very strange manner
7083294 instigated objections against legal protection agencies for investigating and arresting journalists nguyen viet chien and nguyen van hai
7083295 we have to put this matter in front of the law
7083296 we need to put closure to this nightmare that weve been living through for two years
7083297 its not only personal im speaking on behalf of so many
7083298 at least we can raise our voices maybe we can put pressure on the government to at least give us an answer
7083299 he is the prime minister hes supposed to look after the people
7083300 this is a very sad lost opportunity and a crushing blow to the families of the 24 missing officials
7083301 they are only going to repaint their vehicles in russian peacekeeper colors so that the americans dont hassle them to leave any more
7083302 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7083303 we are not opposed to the construction of a sports arena but we do not want those commercial buildings
7083304 if we suffer a setback in baseball at the olympic games a sumptuous dome is not what would make a difference but rather an open space for everyone
7083305 currently parking lots within 300m of the planned dome are already about 80 percent full on holidays how can you think there wont be a problem with tens of thousands of people
7083306 they are out there they are two hours away from the point they were aiming for before they enter gaza territorial waters
7083307 they made very good progress for the night and everyone is fine
7083308 if they want to make provocations then we will know how to deal with them
7083309 we hope taiwan would become a place of no war and an island of peace president ma ying jeou promised no use of force between taiwan and china and he should act on his promise
7083310 the law would help promote cross strait peace taiwan can choose to be independent or to unify with china its unnecessary to start a war
7083311 completely solve the cross strait problem and end the political wrangling within the nation
7083312 peace is built on the ground with full preparation not under conditions that see a country surrender its arms
7083313 the teachers actions were a serious breach of the students rights
7083314 we are united to fight india until we get freedom
7083315 the conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when mohamed was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer
7083316 all security service staff have an awareness of the human rights act of 1998 and are fully committed to complying with the requirements of the law when working in the uk and overseas
7083317 do not participate in solicit encourage or condone the use of torture or inhumane or degrading treatment
7083318 japan is an oceanic country that relies heavily on the use of sea lanes especially the east sea sea of japan for foreign exported natural resources such as oil for the japanese security on the sea lane is a matter of life and death
7083319 we as japanese must be keenly aware of the negative causal effects of being complacent about chinas ambition to take over taiwan
7083320 the japanese people should view the taiwan strait security issue as an issue of their own
7083321 while it is important to maintain a friendly japan china relationship we also must actively contemplate building positive working relations with taiwan
7083322 for us in the united states were pleased with the results of the discussion and i remain very optimistic that were going to continue to make progress toward this important goal
7083323 i explained to prosecutors transactions of the funds during the elections
7083324 i have offered necessary evidence to prosecutors to prove that the money is mine
7083325 at present uighurs do not feel secure anywhere in china including east turkestan as they are seen as political suspects by the prc peoples republic of china authorities
7083326 i am extremely concerned that the chinese government will launch a life and death struggle on the uighur people once the international communitys focus has shifted from china
7083327 as the olympics are being held weve seen the chinese government promise to be more open to the world but it cant even be open to its own citizens how can this kind of openness convince people
7083328 we have asked for their immediate release and are continuing to follow their cases closely
7083329 the us government encourages the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games
7083330 weve done tests on them and found that these items date back to the neolithic age
7083331 during the construction of taihoku imperial university now called national taiwan university in 1928 a farmer discovered some pieces of stone tools at the construction site
7083332 weve done tests on them and found that these items date back to the neolithic age which was about 2 000 to 3 000 years ago
7083333 after discussing the issue with several academics in the fields of history and archeology we filed an application with taipei citys department of cultural affairs
7083334 even though the city government didnt respond to our request positively we can still do something
7083335 as we dont have enough items or funds to build a museum were working to create a virtual museum online to showcase the archeological findings
7083336 although there may still be a long way to go before the shiwufen archeological site can be fully revealed its heading in a positive direction as your efforts have already successfully raised the awareness of the community on its history
7083337 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7083338 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
7083339 it means you had a chance to win gold but you didnt you came so close but we went farther than anybody expected this was a great tournament for us
7083340 im going to take a year off rehab my knee rest myself and see how i feel
7083341 i know playing for jenny was a wonderful experience so was winning the silver
7083342 i love playing with bergie she really gives us a spark
7083343 we received emails and text messages before the game wishing us luck berg said
7083344 we cant wait to talk to wiz we wore her name on the tape on our uniforms she was in our hearts the whole time
7083345 were all looking forward to talking to wiz this has been so hard on their family and its a great family
7083346 they played perfectly to create this perfect ending for the pingpong competition at the beijing olympics i never dreamed it would be so easy
7083347 see how far china has come in the last century
7083348 if you dance with the devil its not the devil that changes
7083349 i can time trial pretty good for a fat kid
7083350 within a sport athletes tend to be more alike than unlike
7083351 you have to remember that every event is made up of different parts
7083352 if you can overcome your slow start it is better to be tall
7083353 fractions of a millimeter in the lever arm will make a difference
7083354 it was the only sport i was really good at
7083355 if someone tells me you cant do that i have to prove them wrong
7083356 there is less bounce in her step she is kind of slow in reacting she looks like she is muscling her way through the race
7083357 there is no way i would ever look like that
7083358 especially against smaller girls who may not have the strength
7083359 i crunch up in a little ball far on the tip of the saddle
7083360 im going to colorado and im going to ride 100 120 miles 160km to 190km a day in the mountains
7083361 we offer services in two flavors if you dont sign in but go straight to search then for all essential purposes the information is anonymous if you do sign in itll remember your browsing history and give you the benefits of personalized search even for these services you can use a pseudonym google doesnt need to know and doesnt want to know your real name
7083362 we cannot even answer the most basic questions about you because we dont know enough about you the goal is to enable google users to be able to ask questions such as what shall i do tomorrow and what job should i take this is the most important aspect of googles expansion
7083363 its the big regulatory issue of the next 10 years how politicians deal with google if the web is as important as the politicians say it seems odd that one company sets the price and defines the terms of business
7083364 first social networks such as facebook and myspace are transforming information about you in a much more targeted and finely grained way google is behind on that second mobile phones will become increasingly useful for information and google is behind on that too finally there are quite a few companies working on personal genomics knowing what your genes are so can you see your profile for genetic diseases and find customized medicine google will have a lot of challenges
7083365 the problem with google now is that they have to keep growing
7083366 if they wanted to they could destroy the publishing business and kill newspapers everything they do has a profound impact its like that saying about america when google sneezes the rest of the world catches a cold
7083367 he was sick he had listeria and that was a factor in his death
7083368 because he was sick and because he had other conditions it absolutely played a role
7083369 he was sick he had listeria and that was a factor in his death
7083370 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation wtf and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7083371 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7083372 i obviously had scored i dont know if they werent watching or what
7083373 thats one of the things i hate about this sport
7083374 i came here as the underdog because of the times i ran so far this year
7083375 its been a good night for kenya we have done something good here for our country
7083376 i knew she jamal would be very strong and i had to work hard to win
7083377 the two of us had plans for what we were going to do but you could say our whole lives stopped
7083378 and believe me when you see someone dying of aids its really bad its different each time no one dies the same way
7083379 this aids study was it seems the beginning of many years of research being carried out on me without my knowledge or consent
7083380 if as the ethics application form states consent was obtained from all subjects how is it that i did not know about my aids status until 1987
7083381 i did not know anything about his studies or research
7083382 i believe nonconsensual research was conducted by doctors of hemophilia in this country
7083383 frustration a sense of being repeatedly betrayed there are lessons to be learned that havent been learned yet
7083384 shes called us mom and dad since she was eight years old
7083385 as a party responsible for these kids we do not find ourselves in position to let them go here anymore
7083386 you may end up going against a senate colleague perhaps mccain perhaps frist
7083387 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7083388 mountain biking is a very tough sport mentally so with age you can get stronger
7083389 we spent all day yesterday watching videos of boonjomnong because we knew that there has to be an effective strategy to fight him nobody else could find the right strategy but i guess we did
7083390 i made history because im the second boxer in the history of the dominican republic to win a medal this is so important for me but also for my country i dont have a coach i have a magician i want to dedicate my victory to my parents my two little kids and to all the people in the dominican republic who have been watching my bouts at 3am in the morning every day just to support me
7083391 all my life ive been waiting for today i went through so much hurt so much but i have tried my hardest
7083392 thats disrespect i dont know where theyre going with that
7083393 but listen ive got the gold medal i made history and it doesnt matter
7083394 im not happy with the way the judges scored the fight but thats it he won and hes got the gold medal
7083395 feel a sense of hunger that generally comes soon after eating ordinary noodle
7083396 the public should be reminded and warned that violating the law on false bomb threats is a crime punishable by up to five years imprisonment and a fine of up to 40 000 pesos us 880
7083397 it was announced by the angolan authorities that they wanted to expel illegal foreigners before the elections
7083398 i didnt have time to react i wasnt even able to hit my brakes or anything what stopped the forward motion of the car is that i ran into a big bear
7083399 the flow is increasing as dramatically as it is because it is operating in a condition of impunity
7083400 the failure of the venezuelan government to go after this is a failure to be serious
7083401 frankly this has gotten to the point where theyre playing games
7083402 usually drugs is beyond a lot of other political differences we have a cooperative relationship with cuba
7083403 there just has been no willingness to establish that cooperation or re establish a working relationship
7083404 youve got to go after the criminals and youve got to go after those who are in positions of authority and are criminals
7083405 the admin and workflow on the new cms kicks ass everybody will love it
7083406 however the major point i made in our interview which he wasnt able to unpack in this short article is that social media metrics are expansive and applicable to nearly all business processes from innovation to product development from strategic and communications planning to communications management from marketing effectiveness to loyalty as well as customer service experience and beyond
7083407 oh client were here for you well help you understand
7083408 if you wish to persuade me you must think my thoughts feel my feelings and speak my words
7083409 oh no shes just two and a half were observing today
7083410 well shes ready for kindergarten only shes not potty trained yet
7083411 when school is over i will be able to relax
7083412 our annual vacation will take place on the week of august 11
7083413 michael phelps nine time olympic gold medalist and role model for squirmy boys time and time again i meet moms of boys who have been told
7083414 yet they are all natural athletes in one sport or another
7083415 clients want to know about roi its no longer just about eyeballs its about what is this ad doing to drive sales
7083416 i dont think you are going to see a wholesale shift but instead buyers will shift dollars little by little
7083417 whats the user experience when they get to the site
7083418 google of course take a look at their home page if youve got all you ducks in a row in the backroom then the storefront can be that simple
7083419 lets chat a few minutes about what you client would like to see happen as a result of the campaign steady some brand wobble sales lift double subscribers
7083420 well there must be some best practices for measurement in this business
7083421 but those practices are applied to an expected outcome for the campaign once we can stick the landing on that well be in good shape and will share our approach
7083422 mountain biking is a very tough sport mentally so with age you can get stronger
7083423 i lost a bit of my concentration in the second set i dont know why
7083424 ive just recovered from a cold ive played a lot of matches these last couple of weeks tonight im paying for it
7083425 ive rekindled the fire ive found a great feel around the court im really on the right track
7083426 ive known caroline since i was 11 i knew that you have to be 100 percent in order to beat her it was just not the case today
7083427 i feel really confident its been a really good month for me
7083428 i started great i played well i was aggressive i had a chance early in the second set to put him away but it didnt happen
7083429 im going to have fun tomorrow and see where it takes me if i play well and win so be it if someone else plays better than i do good on him
7083430 i hit a lot of good tee shots except for the last and my putting came in at the right now after turning in one under i didnt think i could get close to the lead but i started making putts so im quite happy
7083431 the booing was perfectly understandable because we are the world champions and we cannot afford to lose two in a row its unacceptable to play like that
7083432 it was all about execution because the chances were there but we cannot make mistakes like we did today its unacceptable for any international player it was not good enough and unfortunately those mistakes killed us
7083433 its not nice being booed but the crowd is unhappy rightfully so they have every right to be unhappy
7083434 they want to back a winning side but we never go out there to lose on purpose and its a new playing style im trying to get out there rome wasnt built in a day and i ask the people to be patient to give us more time
7083435 youve got to be happy with that the performance was by no means error free but it was never going to be with south africa such a desperate team but the intensity was there the boys got up and did what had to be done the hard way they gutsed it out it was not straightforward and im very happy with the composure
7083436 the boys got up and met the physicality of the springboks they did huge work and it was a good effort
7083437 it was the hardest start to a competition that i could ever imagine
7083438 the bachmans came to a lot of events and they loved the sport
7083439 we have been through a lot and it all kind of spilled over
7083440 we will be sending her some things from here to show her how much we care about the family
7083441 everything absolutely everything i have done has been for this
7083442 matthew mitcham today was absolutely fantastic and i am so glad that a non chinese person won
7083443 i couldnt hear the crowd in my mind i was saying just enjoy it
7083444 chelsea have agreed terms for andriy shevchenko to return to ac milan details of the agreement will remain confidential
7083445 a sense of pride and emotion struck me as the soccer did in 2002
7083446 i could not kick at all i could not hang on
7083447 what i did for over seven months can be destroyed in three weeks
7083448 a sense of pride and emotion struck me as the soccer did in 2002
7083449 i was doubtful about my future but when speaking with guardiola he told me he believed in me and felt i could help the team a lot
7083450 i only wanted to stay if the manager believed in me and if i could bring something to the team
7083451 there are a lot of midfielders in the team but they all have different qualities guardiola has asked me to come from deep and score goals
7083452 the season will be long with almost 70 games and the team needs all its players in top form
7083453 it was good for us we knew that facility very well and it was nice and loud for us so we had that going but it was also about a lot of good players playing well and thats what we have to have at the new place
7083454 i think its going to be a great time for us to get started on a new year a fresh year
7083455 guys are coming back i think its just all around great for this city and this state to bring a new stadium here and have us start doing bigger things
7083456 the first couple of games you only get about 15 plays last week we got 25
7083457 so far its gone pretty good except for getting field goals instead of touchdowns
7083458 it was very difficult and it is very difficult to get motivated but with the help of friends family and my agent we just keep pressing on
7083459 you have to keep looking at that light you have to keep saying something could happen and you have to be ready for it
7083460 when we came in here that was our goal was to get better as an individual and as an offensive unit and weve done that
7083461 the last time andrew fintoff batted like that with me was at edgbaston against australia in 2005 we gave him a new role at no 5 the man is a superstar i am fortunate to have a bloke like that who i can throw the ball to say knock over the stumps
7083462 we asked a lot of the players but we wont be resting on our laurels the team were brilliant we started off well and built a good foundation and this is the stage where steve harmison belongs he should be playing in front of 30 000 40 000 50 000
7083463 we know they can hit the ball but if we get our execution right we should never be going for 98 in the last 10 there is a feeling in the dressing room we can do a lot better we pride ourselves on being better than that but england deserved their win they played with a lot more skill
7083464 today our weekend got off to a good start but obviously it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition
7083465 the setup we have found today is not bad but there is still plenty of room for improvement
7083466 the first day was difficult for everybody especially to get the braking points
7083467 real madrid have become aware of the declarations by the player and deeply regret their content
7083468 real madrid would never want to retain a player against his wishes and as a result they have no alternative but to accept his unilateral decision to rescind his contract if that is what the player wants
7083469 ive told the president the directors and the coach that my aim is to leave real madrid
7083470 im telling the truth i want to leave and i have got the character to tell the press that im not aiming to stay at real madrid i want to play in the premier league
7083471 professor martens confirmed that the players knee is inflammated and advised him to continue for 15 days with the therapeutic protocol he is following
7083472 merrill lynchs conduct harmed tens of thousands of investors who will have the opportunity to get their money back through this agreement
7083473 we will continue to aggressively investigate wrongdoing in the marketing and sale of auction rate securities
7083474 c program files electronic arts command amp conquer red alert 3 redalert3 exe
7083475 there is demand for google search despite what the carriers put in front of them
7083476 staying on top of the situation and communicating regularly with the companies their regulator and the federal reserve
7083477 we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
7083478 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
7083479 what well see is failures where the bankers were dumb in what they did
7083480 in retrospect i was wrong to partially sell the holdings
7083481 they georgian forces will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them
7083482 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7083483 russia has begun its withdrawal from georgia but not completed it
7083484 while we are still alive we will not allow them to stay here
7083485 consumer spending is shrinking from rising oil prices and higher inflation is increasing the costs of companies
7083486 it doesnt help that this is happening while the subprime problem in the us seems to be getting worse
7083487 possible wall street volatility may drive foreign investors here to sell fears of depleting liquidity will further undermine local market sentiment
7083488 we will continue watching when us financial stocks stop sliding as thats an indication for the outlook for the japanese market
7083489 i think some positive sentiment has come into the market through the resources
7083490 negative factors are mostly priced in and investors are counting on more policy support after the olympics
7083491 investors seem to have almost given up on hopes for stocks for now
7083492 although the market has come down a lot i dont think weve yet formed a base
7083493 i think bargain hunting in commodity stocks will continue monday if oil prices continue to rebound
7083494 with fan and fred on the brink of a treasury bailout crucial support to the mortgage market will be sorely tested
7083495 the ensnared banks in turn are asking larger players in the market to redeem their long term borrowings which could trigger further sales of asset backed securities this means credit is about to get even costlier and tighter
7083496 healing in the housing market might still be a few quarters away time that fannie and freddie and possibly several others in the financial industry probably dont have
7083497 the fact that we erased all of yesterdays gains so fast suggests that were still in a bear market theres just not much demand out there
7083498 obviously yesterdays rally was overcooked and were simply taking back some of that speculative risk premium we injected into the market
7083499 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
7083500 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
7083501 after all the bad things weve had this week the oil price is shaking the market again
7083502 markets are extremely nervous at the moment thats why they react very negatively because the situation remains very fragile
7083503 the governments action is not strong enough to stop the wons slide
7083504 there have been a lot of purchases of the dollar from the local energy companies
7083505 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
7083506 we heard that unknown gunmen abducted two foreign journalists a white man and a white woman
7083507 they left us this morning to visit internally displaced camps on the outskirts of mogadishu
7083508 now they are nowhere to be found they were accompanied by a somali translator and were to visit parts of lower shabelle region they are believed to have been kidnapped
7083509 in order to avoid a well publicised provocation in the middle of the sea
7083510 because we know who is on the boats and what they contain we will allow them to land
7083511 the arrival of the two ships after this adventure represents a big breakthrough in the wall of the israeli siege imposed on gaza
7083512 this is solely a conference aimed at supporting and strengthening georgia in economic terms
7083513 its not a conference aimed at finding a political solution to the conflict
7083514 a decision about the whether when and who is entirely the responsibility of the eu presidency
7083515 convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant event to occur in europe since the end of communism
7083516 the tent and tea are still part of our lives but we are moving forward
7083517 you learn things in life and that is good the wife has to help make ends meet she can no longer stay buried at home and has to work and leave the house just like men
7083518 we feared that the project would be criticized because people can think that we are trying to get the women out of the home and away from tradition
7083519 we choose the poorest of the poorest women in the bedouin communities
7083520 i always sewed pillows at home as a child this is an old bedouin tradition and praise god things are going well
7083521 i took a loan from sawa and bought raw materials from factories in beersheba
7083522 today i even employ other women who sew at home
7083523 we feared that the project would be criticized because people can think that we are trying to get the women out of the home and away from tradition
7083524 but there are many men who are very happy with the program simply because the familys income is increasing today we feel support and even active support from men
7083525 we might include men in the project in the future but similar programs across the world have been more successful among women
7083526 perhaps it was god who put these two great resources right next to each other
7083527 if they have one spill up there whats going to happen
7083528 this is our livelihood theyre going to ruin it for everybody
7083529 ive never been a guy whos been in bed with the environmental movement
7083530 its going to have to be the most environmentally tight mine ever designed on planet earth if its going to go
7083531 were supposed to be managing it for multiple uses theres this mandate that we need to somehow make a living off alaskas state land
7083532 its broad its unspecific its going to be subject to many legal challenges
7083533 were just trying to convince alaskans that ok we can have mining just not in this place
7083534 its such an exceptional risk to such an exceptional fishery
7083535 i certainly dont want my legacy to be that we destroyed a fishery or part of a fishery
7083536 but if we can do it correctly id love to see it done because i think the benefits are huge
7083537 theres more cars here now than you can shake a stick at
7083538 the plan is that it will stretch from the first georgian village for several kilometres and will house about 30 000 residents
7083539 a michael phelps like performance for usain bolt three races three golds three world records
7083540 just when you thought the jamaicans were having a perfect olympics here comes something like this
7083541 the right to life recognized by the constitution remains protected from the moment of conception
7083542 the issue of womens rights is the core of our argument
7083543 this may be the most important decision in the entire history of the court in terms of peoples rights
7083544 cool weve got all these artists up onstage together and it looks like theyve practiced
7083545 these reflect credit upon a young man of limited opportunities
7083546 this would not prevent very large powerful patent holders from rejecting offers
7083547 we had the one day friday where it kind of came back thats why we decided to do what we did it has gotten better the treatment and stuff is definitely working
7083548 so were dealing with that too the doctors say its going to help so were going with it
7083549 i think that was part of the problem yesterday having that whole day off and not doing any treatments
7083550 casualties are down but insert reason this is fragile and could unravel leading iraq back to the death spiral
7083551 but even though we appear to be losing because of insert reason there is reason to hope that american forces and our iraqi friends will learn to cope with this problem and emerge victorious in the end
7083552 maar het waren altijd jan jans en de kinderen die na het opstaan op me wachtten daarna heb ik twee projecten voor de leprastichting gedaan pas daarna had ik de tijd serieus aan woutertje te werken
7083553 het is ook geen standaard stripboek er staan wat strips in maar ook losse pen en potloodtekeningen en schilderijen
7083554 de integrale tekst gebruiken was uitgesloten niet alleen omdat het hier gaat om een heel lijvig boek maar vooral omdat multatuli geen rechtlijnig verhaal vertelt het boek zit vol uitweidingen en toelichtingen we zijn samen gaan kijken welke fragmenten zich goed lieten illustreren of verstrippen we zijn uitgekomen op de kern van het boek het leven van pietertje

7083586 dat heeft me lang geteisterd ik wilde een kaal koppie zoals alle andere jongens dat meisjesachtige heeft me als kleuter nogal zorgen gebaard maar mijn moeder was zo trots op die krullen
7083587 ik lustte niets maar ik moest altijd mijn bord leegeten
7083588 op 4 jarige leeftijd toen jan net een potlood kon vasthouden begon hij al te tekenen andere mensen zeiden het ook dat is toch niet gewoon voor zon klein kind hij speelde wel op straat en in de zandbak in de tuin maar dan lag hij daar toch weer vaak op zijn buik een viooltje na te tekenen altijd maar tekenen en verhaaltjes schrijven daar bedoelde hij strips mee
7083589 ik vond het rampzalig als ik nog zon schrijfschriftje zie met van die letters met ophaaltjes dat is me een verdriet soms heb ik er nog nachtmerries van
7083590 ik herinner me nog het begin van de oorlog als iets feestelijks wist je veel je hoefde niet naar school je vader bleef thuis en de buren stonden met elkaar te praten wij holden tussen die groepjes door en deden vliegtuigjes na een paar dagen later werd rotterdam gebombardeerd toen ging je de bezorgdheid van je ouders wel heel sterk voelen
7083591 dag meneer ik ben jan kruis en ik zou zo graag eens met een echte tekenaar praten
7083592 wim meuldijk was voor mij heel erg belangrijk door hem zag ik wat ik later wilde worden
7083593 geen werkstukje om trots op te zijn maar ik wist toen wel zeker dat ik striptekenaar wilde worden
7083594 mijn ouders stonden er zeer welwillend tegenover ze hadden hun uiterste best gedaan om mij op de academie te krijgen maar het was een wereld die ze niet kenden waar ze toch wel een beetje wantrouwig tegenover stonden ze waren dan ook blij dat ik de reclamekant koos daar zaten toch in elk geval meer mogelijkheden in dan in de kunst zo leerde ik in elk geval een vak en dat gaf enige zekerheid
7083595 figuratieve figuren zijn schaars op een academie belangrijk is daar de ontwikkeling van smaak als je gevoel hebt voor vormgeving voor letters dan kun je reclame ontwerper worden daar hoef je niet voor te kunnen tekenen
7083596 ik heb altijd hoog opgezien tegen mensen met een grote parate kennis een ietwat ziekelijke bewondering voor intellectuelen voor die jongens die 5 jaar hbs hadden en goed engels frans en duits konden spreken daar had ik altijd respect voor voor journalistiek heb ik altijd belangstelling gehad dus zodra er op de academie iet gedaan moest worden met perscommuniqu s of schoolkrantjes was ik altijd van de partij maar dan maakte ik soms domme taalfouten dat heeft me eigenlijk mijn hele leven achtervolgd de onzekerheid daarover en dan te bedenken dat mijn strip nu in taalboekjes staat
7083597 twee leraren zijn heel belangrijk geweest voor mij in die tijd jacques van houwwelingen en aard glansdorp van houwelingen had me al sinds de middagcursus les gegeven glansdorp was ook een echte tekenaar ik had razende bewondering voor hem zoals hij tekende dat vond ik grandioos die belangstelling voor dat zuiver vaktechnische heb ik altijd gehouden
7083598 ik kon niet op mijn krent gaan zitten daar waren mijn ouders tegen ik wilde ook wel werken want ik kon best wat geld gebruiken bovendien wilde ik ook naar parijs
7083599 de jongens die ik in die tijd heb leren kennen dat zijn mensen met wie je de rest van je leven bezig blijft meisjes speelden ook een rol een belangrijke zelfs zeker in mijn tekeningen ik bewonderde altijd wel een of ander meisje van een afstand en dat typetje kwam je dan in allerlei tekeningetjes uit die tijd tegen maar meestal had ik het hart niet om ze te benaderen
7083600 we gingen echt losbarsten op onze manier achteraf gezien viel het nogal mee er was natuurlijk heel weinig geld voor uitspattingen maar ik vond het fantastisch de vriendenkring van de academie bleef bestaan je zag elkaar in het caf bij openingen van tentoonstellingen en bij feestjes
7083601 ik heb er een verschrikkelijk gezellige tijd gehad nijgh is een soort verlengstuk van de academie voor me geweest
7083602 ik was daar bijzonder mee verguld maar het is nooit gepubliceerd
7083603 wat ik vooral sterk vond van jan kruis is zijn manier om de figuren in de strip te laten acteren een tekenaar is een soort regisseur hij moet door zijn personages gevoelens laten uitdrukken en emoties en sfeer jan beheerste dat buitengewoon goed
7083604 er zat een gegeven in dat me aansprak een tovenaartje dat wel kon toveren hij was op de tovenaarsschool geweest en had best talent maar hij kon de woorden niet onthouden hetzelfde probleem als ik altijd had hij had daar reuze moeite mee en daarom maakte hij er meestal een zooitje van aanvankelijk schreef ik alleen grofweg de inhoud van de balloons en die gaf ik aan mijn broer hij maakte dan de uiteindelijke tekstjes
7083605 joop wiggers de uitgever van jan jans en de kinderen was nog een broekie toen ik hem leerde kennen bij van maanen hij zat olidin te maken en deed de kleurseparaties voor mijn strips toen had hij al allerlei klusjes en handeltjes thuis hij regelde het allemaal wel slim zakelijk
7083606 martin lodewijk leerde ik in 1962 kennen hij was de eerste die tegen me zei wat hij helemaal niet goed vond aan mijn werk martin wist veel meer van strips af dan ik strips wat iedereen toen rotzooi vond wist hij op de juiste waarde te schatten vooral tommy moest het ontgelden en daar had hij gelijk in het was gemaakt door iemand die totaal niets van westerns en de mythevorming rond het wilde westen wist martin was een van de weinigen die zich daar behoorlijk kritisch tegenover opstelde maar het bedierf ons contact niet we zijn altijd vrienden gebleven
7083607 ik ben nooit wat je noemt een strenge vader geweest dat liet ik meestal aan els over die is daar wat kortdater in geweest je vindt het ook terug in jan jans en de kinderen ik heb nooit met overtuiging kunnen zeggen je moet je eten opeten tenslotte lustte ik vroeger ook geen andijvie
7083608 ik heb ook plotjes uit gregor gebruikt voor jan jans en de kinderen gewoon gejat van mezelf
7083609 gregor heb ik altijd een leuke strip gevonden jan zette zich bewust af tegen strips zoals wij die kenden in zijn lijnvoering in zijn kaders ook in de structuur van de strip nam hij afstand in het laatste plaatje legde hij de grap uit zijn manier van vertellen veranderde werd steeds persoonlijker in het begin heb ik nog wel eens plotjes aangedragen maar later werd dat onmogelijk bij gregor kon dat nog wel
7083610 hij vroeg aan me wil jij niet eens proberen sjors en sjimmie in te kleuren dat ging aardig goed onder enorme supervisie natuurlijk hij wilde dat niet uit handen geven hij wilde er zelf bij zijn nu ook nog bij bepaalde strips laat hij los maar bij anderen als hij bijvoorbeeld een landschap heeft gebruikt als achtergrond zegt hij heel uitgebreid hoe het moet
7083611 grote verhalen zijn altijd een probleem voor me geweest ik was veel sterker in gags ik ben nooit blij geweest met sjors en sjimmie ik heb er nooit voor de volle 100 met plezier aan gewerkt het was niet echt van mezelf
7083612 de kracht van jan kruis is dat jan jans en de kinderen echt zijn strip is het is helemaal met zijn persoon verweven
7083613 ik had ze wel kunnen laten meegroeien maar dan zit ik straks met 2 tieners dat is nog wel leuk maar als die de deur uitgaan zit ik alleen met een strip met volwassenen en dat is niet leuk bovendien hebben kinderen een onbevangen kijk op de wereld en kun je ze als striptekenaar de meest verschrikkelijke uitspraken in de mond leggen waar je je later makkelijk achter kan verschuilen
7083614 ik heb hem inderdaad gemaakt omdat ik volstrekt in tijdnood was hij is mijn redding bij deadlines en dat begon gelijk met dat je weet wel verhaal daarmee heb ik de steen gelegd voor een eindeloze reeks variaties maar hij is meer dan een huisdier hij geeft geregeld commentaar op gebeurtenissen en vertolkt op die manier vaak de mening van jan kruis zelf die noemt hem ook wel zijn proloogzegger degene voor het doek die het publiek uitlegt waar het eigenlijk over gaat juist omdat hij zon simpele vorm heeft kon hij het boegbeeld worden van jan jans en de kinderen ik kan die kater laten acteren als een gek ik kan hem laten zingen dansen huilen ik kan hem alles laten doen het is een ontzettend expressief figuur
7083615 geld heeft altijd een belangrijke rol gespeeld ik heb nogal wat dure hobbys
7083616 unser konzept ist nicht zuletzt dank dem ausgepr gten engagement meiner kollegen weitestgehend aufgegangen kassel ist und bleibt ein guter platz f r friedliche fu ballfans nicht aber f r gewaltt tige randalierer
7083617 wir m ssen die segel hissen und wieder fahrt aufnehmen
7083618 zwei sieger und zwei dramatische bef rderungen an einfluss respekt und anerkennung
7083619 carragher was amazing normally he isnt a great finisher after that gerrard showed his quality even though he isnt 100 per cent fit he can still change games
7083620 the team showed its winning mentality this is the kind of determination we want to see for the rest of the season last season we were drawing or losing these games at home so it was important we won it sends a positive message to the fans who were maybe thinking about last season
7083621 we did it the hard way i was pleased in the first 15 minutes because we were creating chances but after that we did not play well and they were controlling our attacks
7083622 they scored a good goal and were on top of us i thought it would be difficult so we changed tactic we played with three defenders that was the key
7083623 with regards to the situation which came about because of the early goal and the sending off it wasnt easy for us today
7083624 but what was noticeable was the way my side played in the second half and how much they wanted the equaliser
7083625 its like edward cullen was so beautiful i creamed myself i mean every line is like that hes the most ridiculous person whos so amazing at everything i think a lot of actors tried to play that aspect i just couldnt to that
7083626 wenn wir die verbraucher anders vor kriminellen machenschaften nicht sch tzen k nnen m ssen wir berlegen ob wir den handel mit pers nlichen daten generell verbieten

7083634 that opens up a whole new fertile area give me a minute
7083635 sham of the councils justification for the introduction of charges to recycle at the derrinumera and rathroeen amenity centres mayo county council received recycling grants of 313 700 last year alone
7083636 we should not forget that mayo county council sells on to companies much of the recycled waste such as aluminium cans paper and cardboard thus offsetting the costs of the centres even more
7083637 since 2006 mayo county council has also received grants totalling 109 563 to offset the operational costs of the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee scheme and in december 2007 mayo county council received 60 637 under weee
7083638 the fact that the grants take into account the amount recycled to cover increase use means that the busier the centres are the more money mayo county council receives to offset recycling charges
7083639 i believe the polluter should pay and not the recycler
7083640 the majority of people using these recycling centres are low income families and the retired who have decided to take charge of their own waste disposal and recycling needs these are the people who will be hit the hardest by these fees fees which i think are unjustified given the amount of money being provided by the dept of the environment
7083641 friend i have some important news that i want to make official ive chosen joe biden to be my running mate

7083645 isto estava de acordo com as nossas previs es a gente sempre encarou com muita humildade esse processo todo mas esse crescimento j era esperado em fun o de que eu n o era um candidato conhecido pela cidade mas a partir do momento em que eu me tornasse mais conhecido a minha trajet ria as minhas propostas a tend ncia era o crescimento da aceita o da popula o
7083646 isso era em fun o de n o ser conhecido e os outros candidatos isto em sua grande maioria t m uma trajet ria parlamentar j disputaram v rias elei es e portanto eram mais conhecidos
7083647 de fato eu acredito que nas pr ximas pesquisas de inten o de voto n s cresceremos mais e consolidaremos a nossa posi o eu espero que os n meros estejam acima dos 30 nas pr ximas semanas

7083651 the two of us had plans for what we were going to do but you could say our whole lives stopped
7083652 and believe me when you see someone dying of aids its really bad its different each time no one dies the same way
7083653 this aids study was it seems the beginning of many years of research being carried out on me without my knowledge or consent
7083654 if as the ethics application form states consent was obtained from all subjects how is it that i did not know about my aids status until 1987
7083655 i did not know anything about his studies or research
7083656 i believe nonconsensual research was conducted by doctors of hemophilia in this country

7083659 people like putin they have no other idea of how to rule
7083660 what russia does now it cannot be analyzed with modern political logic it is obsolete if modern countries like the u s declare war they have more or less rational reasons even if they are mistaken
7083661 you shouldnt expect logic from a kgb lieutenant colonel anyway you shouldnt expect modern political thinking
7083662 russia is a big and capable country which will not let the west dictate the conditions
7083663 in any situation russia is going to act as it sees fit
7083664 russia has never been conquered not in 1 000 years though many tried
7083665 its because its in our genes not to allow anyone to dictate the conditions how to act where to act
7083666 theyve realized that if russia merely plays the role the west has made for it we would quickly become a country that protects the pipeline sending gas and oil from western siberia
7083667 it is too early to bury russia as a great power
7083668 what makes the situation even more difficult is that all these small nations which existed between russia and the heart of europe they have rushed to join europe
7083669 das ist rgerlich nach einem spiel mit dem ich durchaus zufrieden war wir haben uns selbst um den lohn unserer arbeit gebracht

7083673 no they leave us alone and we leave them alone
7083674 no they might encourage people to observe islamic law but most of us do so anyway
7083675 if anybody says anything bad about the taliban theyll go after them
7083676 why is the government bombing our homes the taliban want to bring peace to the area
7083677 it is because of these atrocities that people are giving the militants more and more sympathy

7083686 near term gasoline prices peaked in late june early july and are likely to trend lower at least through the year provided u s oil and gasoline consumption continue to decline which i think they will
7083687 are likely to drop another 20 30 cents by late january 2008
7083688 the gasoline price decline for the next six months represents a reprieve
7083689 it could extend through 2009 if both the u s and global economies remain sluggish and u s consumers continue to make more efficient choices with their vehicles but that doesnt blot out oils long term fundamentals which still point to a resumption of price increases by 2010

7083757 everything from gas to groceries health care to college tuition has gone up
7083758 and well do this while bringing down the budget deficit cutting unnecessary spending and government waste in washington and responsibly ending the war in iraq

7083760 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7083761 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7083762 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7083763 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7083764 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7083765 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7083766 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7083767 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7083768 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7083769 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7083770 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7083771 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7083772 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7083773 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7083774 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7083775 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7083776 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7083777 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7083778 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7083779 it creates a troubling perception when washington policymakers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line
7083780 market participants failed to soundly manage measure and disclose risks with ignorance greed or hubris playing their customary roles
7083781 the alarms of the financial sector have been overstated the real economy has slowed down but is not yet in severe difficulty
7083782 it headed off disaster the history of financial crises tells you the economy doesnt get sick the next week it takes a while
7083783 in the case of bear stearns it is not clear from publicly available information how much contagion there would have been had it been allowed to fail
7083784 the go to statement as it stands is just too primitive it is too much an invitation to make a mess of ones program one can regard and appreciate the clauses considered as bridling its use i do not claim that the clauses mentioned are exhaustive in the sense that they will satisfy all needs but whatever clauses are suggested e g abortion clauses they should satisfy the requirement that a programmer independent coordinate system can be maintained to describe the process in a helpful and manageable way
7083785 and while they are indeed hidden gotos they are acceptable as they are implemented in a very structured way in languages like java c c and many others on the other hand all constructs in structured languages are implemented with hidden gotos underneath
7083786 senator obama has made an outstanding selection in joe biden joe biden is a strong leader fierce advocate and devoted family man with values rooted in the best of what america stands for he will be a strong partner with barack obama in bringing the change america wants and needs
7083787 delegates here in denver are already buzzing with strong enthusiasm for the obama biden ticket
7083788 senator obamas selection shows that unlike the bush mccain way of doing politics obama is not afraid to have strong people around him helping to lead our great country

7083798 i havent pumped my own gas in quite awhile because when youre protected by the secret service youre not allowed to do things like that i cant remember exactly the last time i pumped my own gas and i cant remember what i paid for gas the last time i did so
7083799 its not terribly important what the price of gas was the last time i pumped my own what matters is that the price of gas today is up to an unprecedented 4 a gallon on average and this is hurting many americans not only is it busting their budgets just to fill their gas tanks but its affecting the prices of goods and services they pay for their travel and vacations and almost every other factor that affects their lifestyle and something must be done to address this

7083807 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
7083808 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
7083809 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality

7083843 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
7083844 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
7083845 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

7083853 in order for a young body to attain maximal growth bones and muscles need adequate nutrition and calories
7083854 if a child pre teen or even a teenager who is not done growing trains at such a high level that shes not able to consume as many calories as her body uses on a daily basis she wont gain adequate weight which can cause developmental problems
7083855 for starters if you dont eat enough especially during your growth spurt your bones simply wont grow so you may end up a lot shorter than you were supposed to be
7083856 if you dont gain enough weight you can even delay the onset of puberty
7083857 for example gymnasts are often very petite with smaller breasts whats more when you delay puberty you also delay getting your first period of course there are exceptions to this rule
7083858 unfortunately we arent entirely sure how olympic training will affect health down the road
7083859 but if a child is chronically undernourished her overused joints can become arthritic sooner than they otherwise would have
7083860 on the other hand exercise does have beneficial effects on bone strength cardiovascular health and muscle development
7083861 it all depends upon the particular child the sport the degree of intensity and her overall health and nutritional status in order to predict whether a pre teen olympic athlete will be a healthy adult
7083862 we all know a balance of fruits vegetables proteins carbohydrates and fats provides the best nutrition
7083863 michael phelps burns calories much faster than the rest of us and it can be difficult for his body to keep up with those expenditures therefore he can afford to eat foods at least some of the time that the rest of us try to avoid
7083864 my guess is that while he may indulge in pizza and pancakes and pasta before practices and meets he probably eats his fair share of vegetables and fruits as well

7083986 no conf o para nada que el mercosur se convierta en una uni n aduanera en el corto o mediano plazo el bloque es un organismo b sicamente pol tico no avanz nada en la consolidaci n de la uni n porque hay muchos problemas entre cada uno de los pa ses
7083987 el mercosur no es una uni n aduanera imperfecta sino una perfecta desuni n aduanera
7083988 la integraci n a n est pendiente esta es una triste realidad la conclusi n tras 17 a os de existencia del bloque es que hay una gran tarea pendiente y por eso no es posible ponerle fechas como est n haciendo a nivel gubernamental
7083989 el mercosur no va a avanzar hacia una uni n aduanera
7083990 si bien en los discursos cada vez se va a hablar m s fuerte del mercosur o del proceso de integraci n desde el punto de vista pr ctico va a ser muy dif cil de alcanzar la uni n por lo menos en el mediano plazo
7083991 ning n pa s se va a suicidar y hablar en contra del mercosur pero en los hechos en la pr ctica hay intereses muy divergentes al interior del bloque

7083998 im extremely pleased to announce the launch of tracemonkey an evolution of firefoxs spidermonkey javascript engine for firefox 3 1 that uses a new kind of just in time jit compiler to boost javascript performance by an order of magnitude or more
7083999 tracemonkey advances us toward the mozilla 2 future where even more firefox code is written in javascript firefox gets faster and safer as this process unfolds
7084000 the goal of the tracemonkey project which is still in its early stages is to take javascript performance to another level where instead of competing against other interpreters we start to compete against native code
7084001 we have bugs to fix and an enormous number of optimizations still to choose from but we re charging full speed ahead on the work we need to do for this to be a part of firefox 3 1
7084002 depending on the benchmarks you choose you might see massive speed up minor speed up or maybe even some slowdown those latter cases are definitely bugs and reporting them through bugzilla will be a big help
7084003 this means we are ready for mobile and desktop target platforms out of the box
7084004 as the performance keeps going up people will write and transport code that was too slow to run in the browser as javascript this means the web can accommodate workloads that right now require a proprietary plugin

7084037 the islanders had another writing the so called tau script which recorded their annals and other secular matters but this has disappeared

7084075 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
7084076 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7084077 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7084078 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7084079 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7084080 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7084081 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7084082 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7084083 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
7084084 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7084085 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7084086 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7084087 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7084088 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7084089 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7084090 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7084091 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7084092 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7084093 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7084094 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7084095 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7084096 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7084097 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7084102 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7084103 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7084104 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7084105 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7084106 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7084107 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7084108 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7084109 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7084110 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7084111 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7084112 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7084113 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7084114 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7084115 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7084116 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

7084124 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7084125 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7084126 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7084135 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7084136 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7084137 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7084138 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7084139 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

7084150 i heard some people calling for help but i couldnt do anything
7084151 a few minutes later i heard the sirens and thought i am saved
7084152 she had called less than 10 minutes before to say the plane was about to depart
7084153 everything went very fast a strange shaking sensation as plane tossed up and down and left to right
7084154 i remember tightening my seat belt and the next thing i found myself in a shallow creek
7084155 we have messages showing there was a sort of meeting or discussion on board to stop the flight from leaving
7084156 there was negligence we have witnesses many of us received calls from our relatives or messages saying something strange was happening
7084157 we dont want psychologists we want a technical expert to tell us what happened to our loved ones
7084158 it has been the worst ever catastrophe for the canaries and especially for this small town
7084159 normally this sunday everyone joins in the fun and many families and former residents return to enjoy dancing in the streets lots of music games competitions traditional dress drinks and lots of food thats all cancelled
7084160 i thought small crosses on the side of the road were for traffic fatalities
7084161 all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france
7084162 they want to keep these checkpoints as we know but they have no legal basis for it
7084163 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7084164 until now the us supported russias integration in the world community we have admitted russia to the group of eight and we have saluted and encouraged its wish to join the wto
7084165 our position is that they should pull out to the sixth of august positions
7084166 mr asif zardari has accepted to contest the election for the office of president of pakistan after the party unanimously drafted him to do so
7084167 the coalition partners were informed about this decision and we are optimistic that the coalition will remain intact
7084168 they were taken under the threat of firearms it was an abduction
7084169 its clear that they were kidnapped because their schedule was to come back to the hotel before 12 in the afternoon and we dont have their whereabouts
7084170 we contacted the place where they were heading but so far they havent seen them
7084171 they left this morning and all their phone numbers are switched off we are not sure but it seems that they were kidnapped
7084172 its been a blessing for me to be out on this court
7084173 i havent necessarily played great during this tournament tonight i got into some foul trouble as did diana taurasi and katie smith but we fought hard and beat australia its the third olympics in a row weve faced them for the gold for all those kids out there i encourage you to write down all your goals
7084174 you look at the shooting and that tells a story
7084175 we were down in the 20s percent you cant win ball games like that so credit goes to them
7084176 all in all the citizens of the united states of america and indeed people around the world can be proud of our team
7084177 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7084178 this is what is going to happen now georgia is going to accelerate its march toward nato and i hope to an action plan in december
7084179 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7084180 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7084181 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7084182 has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7084183 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7084184 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7084185 can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7084186 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7084187 i slept through the whole thing it wasnt very dramatic when it came onshore
7084188 i just think were so fortunate we didnt have high tide and a stronger wind because hurricane dennis is still fresh in our mind the tidal surge we had in here
7084189 im extremely happy so many times weve fallen short here but all 22 guys showed a lot of determination today
7084190 the two teams that won in 2000 and then in 2008 are chalk and cheese in 2000 we had won just about every trophy and its very different now
7084191 but speak to me in one or two years and im sure ill be able to give you a more positive answer
7084192 the boks were desperate and it was extremely physical out there
7084193 but the boys did what they had to do and they did it the hard way the key now is to back it up which is something we havent done in the past
7084194 i think the boys will relax and enjoy this victory tonight and then well move on
7084195 i think the elvs allow you to choose what style you want to play the scrum has become even more important because it is such a good platform from which to launch an attack
7084196 the boks boast good physicality across the park but i dont think a one dimensional approach would have cut the mustard all three sides in the tri nations are up for the physical fight so i suppose you do have to be creative in getting round their defence
7084197 its understandable were the world champions we just didnt get it right today and i can tell you now that the players feel even worse than the crowd
7084198 this is our job this is our passion this is our work this is our life we are a proud team and a proud nation its not good enough
7084199 we worked hard all week but our execution wasnt up to scratch there were just too many mistakes they also had too many chances from turnovers
7084200 there were a lot of those that were right on the finger tips it was that kind of game when those few inches make the difference
7084201 i am very excited olympic gold and record what more could i want
7084202 i had just enough energy to make the break i did that for the people of ethiopia
7084203 i came here as the underdog because of the times i ran so far this year
7084204 its been a good night for kenya we have done something good here for our country
7084205 i knew she jamal would be very strong and i had to work hard to win
7084206 it was the most worthwhile course ive taken as a student not only in the mba program but also in all my years in academia the design tour was a once in a lifetime opportunity that many of us may never have again to tour innovative companies and learn from internationally recognized business thinkers and leaders thank you for going above and beyond what is expected of a teacher while other professors are content to teach from a text you took us out of the classroom and into the real world thank you again for taking us along for the ride it was an amazing experience and one i will not soon forget

7084209 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7084210 facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when bm was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan in the period april 2002 until at least 17 may 2002 when he was seen by an officer of the security service
7084211 that the security service continued to facilitate the interviewing of bm by providing information and questions after 17 may 2002 in the knowledge of what was reported to them as to the circumstances of his detention and treatment in pakistan
7084212 and they must also have appreciated that he was not in a united states facility
7084213 by seeking to interview bm in the circumstances found in pakistan and supplying information and questions for his interviews the relationship between the united kingdom and the united states authorities was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
7084214 the court has no doubt that on the basis of that information the security service were right to conclude that bm was a person of great potential significance and a serious potential threat to the national security of the united kingdom
7084215 i have two points to make firstly the music you listen to is more or less finite in the sense that your choice of music will become more selective as you grow older yet there will be more and more music to choose from secondly discovering music is one thing but listening to it is quite another discovering it has a certain kind of meaning but once youve discovered it well whats left it isnt as if music accretes meaning you dont get wiser for listening to the same old sorry tracks each day music doesnt push anyone forward it just pulls you back if you thought nostalgia was bad if you felt sorry for someone on account of their nostalgic temperament well let me tell you music is a hundred times worse music doesnt even give you the chance to say no thats wrong it just throws it all up in your face and theres no turning back the minute you hit play youre a gonner you cant reason with it and if you choose to play one musics interpretation over some other facet of your life then in time you will wipe away the facet and be left only with the musical interpretation that isnt getting into music thats simply carving great chunks out of yourself and throwing them away
7084216 actually the contrary i love it far more than words and have written it for years many years longer than i ever wrote words but i religiously fail to listen to it most especially my own because i know just what it can do id rather be drunk any night than listen to music because i can talk and reason to an extent when i am drunk but i cannot do anything with music
7084217 the beauty myth how images of beauty are used against women
7084218 we had the one day friday where it kind of came back thats why we decided to do what we did it has gotten better the treatment and stuff is definitely working
7084219 so were dealing with that too the doctors say its going to help so were going with it
7084220 i think that was part of the problem yesterday having that whole day off and not doing any treatments
7084221 nice guys can get the corner office eight strategies for winning in business without being a jerk
7084222 such claims have logical validity in that they could be a problem
7084223 but our assessment is that if you run the process right none of those things happen

7084226 the world has not forgotten the people of this land today we are all from gaza
7084227 we recognize that were two humble boats but what weve accomplished is to show that average people from around the world can mobilize to create change we do not have to stay silent in the face of injustice reaching gaza today there is such a sense of hope and hope is what mobilizes people everywhere
7084228 were the first ones in 41 years to enter gaza freely but we wont be the last we welcome the world to join us and see what were seeing
7084229 what weve done shows that people can do what governments should have done if people stand up against injustice we can truly be the conscience of the world

7084232 du bist bestimmt froh zum ersten mal seit kanada wieder in den top 3 zu sein dieses rennen hast du nat rlich gewonnen
7084233 ja mit sicherheit ist es besser als dritter zu starten anstatt als f nfter oder siebter das qualifying verlief ziemlich gut und hier stehen wir nun das auto arbeitete besser als vor kurzem aber wir m ssen uns daran erinnern dass ich auch in ungarn nicht von weit hinten ins rennen gestartet bin da ich vierter war
7084234 ich stand also in der zweiten reihe hoffentlich werden wir im morgigen rennen nicht denselben fehler wie in ungarn machen die strecke ist so oder so ziemlich rutschig zumindest mit unserem auto wir m ssen aus diesem grund vielleicht die allgemeine haftung verbessern es wird ziemlich wichtig sein mit den reifen hauszuhalten
7084235 wie schwierig ist es wenn du nicht wirklich das vertrauen in die strecke hast
7084236 ich habe vertrauen in die strecke ich war in keinem simulator gewesen ich lief am donnerstag eine runde bevor ich in das auto stieg und nach f nf runden schaffte ich es gute bremspunkte zu finden ich war in jeder einheit ziemlich konstant hatte in keinem versuch irgendwelche schreckmomente nat rlich ver ndern sich die bedingungen
7084237 heute kam der wind aus einer v llig anderen richtung als gestern dies hat etwas einfluss auf die balance des autos das haftungsniveau hat sich ver ndert gestern verbesserte es sich aber wir hatten vergangene nacht sehr starken regen dieser hat den gummi etwas weggewaschen es ver ndern sich also viele faktoren und man muss sich an sie sehr schnell anpassen
7084238 zumindest sp re ich dass er sich sehr schnell ver ndert und dies kann einen gro en einfluss haben besonders wenn man von der ideallinie abkommt oder deine linie ein wenig anders ist als jene der anderen
7084239 man muss sich also daran anpassen wo die meisten leute fahren wo sie ihre r der hinsetzen denn dort gibt es mehr gummi aber nicht alle autos nehmen dieselbe linie wir haben schon gestern im ersten sektor gesehen dass wir zu k mpfen hatten und dies war auch heute der fall aber es sieht danach aus als sei dies unser limit
7084240 und das berholen die fahrer sagen dass man von der ideallinie weggehen muss um zu berholen und dass es dies zweifelsohne schwierig gestaltet
7084241 ja wenn ich mir dies von au en und aus dem auto anschaue dann gibt es ein paar pl tze zum berholen so wie am ende der langen gerade und auch vor der kurve 17 aber es gestaltet es schwierig dass alle so eng beieinander liegen
7084242 wenn das haftungsniveau berall gleich w re dann w rde es dies viel einfacher gestalten aber nun gibt es neben der ideallinie eine menge staub und dies macht es sehr schwierig
7084243 welchen fehler hat das team in ungarn gemacht den du nicht noch einmal machen m chtest und wie erkl rst du dass du dritter bist liegt es daran dass es sich um eine neue strecke handelt und du neue strecken magst oder liegt es an der verbesserung des autos
7084244 zum ersten teil der frage ich denke nicht dass es ein geheimnis ist wir haben in bezug auf den reifen druck einen gro en fehler gemacht ungl cklicherweise war es in ungarn sehr schlecht dass dieser fehler mit allen drei s tzen gemacht wurde im ersten abschnitt des rennens hoffte ich dass das problem behoben sein wird wenn ich f r den zweiten abschnitt des rennens neue reifen aufziehe aber das problem wurde sogar noch gr er aber das ist v llig klar und wir werden uns verbessern
7084245 und was den unterschied ausmacht ich sp re keinen unterschied in ungarn war ich vierter hier bin ich dritter da sehe ich keinerlei unterschied das auto ist dasselbe es gibt im vergleich zu den vergangenen beiden rennen bis hier kein upgrade schlussendlich sind wir einfach hier und versuchen im qualifying die bestm gliche runde zu fahren was wir beinahe immer schaffen aber in den rennen ist es schwierig wenn es dir an haftung mangelt die reifen nutzen sich mehr ab wenn du rutschst und die geschwindigkeit im rennen ist wom glich schlechter als jene der top autos

7084250 weve asked him to do videos with us and stuff which hes also agreed to do he was very nice about it and then we blew it somehow
7084251 he heard we did way too much drugs and never slept

7084255 i have researched it and am not going to make excuses but the fact is that mediafire has made several upgrades recently when i was taking a break from blogging
7084256 in all seriousness i am the one who f ed up by not realizing that without creating an account mediafire has been archiving my uploads for my convenience via my browser cache and that as part of their new convenient features they offer automatic folder sharing which must be turned off i dont blame anyone for and am not accusing anyone of stealing things

7084260 well i couldnt resist throwing this out there but feel free to take it away
7084261 hey ive come up with something that nobody else has done
7084262 no no i cant go out mom says i have to work on my song
7084263 insurgents engaged the soldiers from multiple points within the compound using small arms and rpg rocket propelled grenade fire the joint forces responded with small arms fire and an air strike killing 30 militants
7084264 the picks say something profound about obama for all his self confidence the 47 year old illinois senator worried that he couldnt beat republican john mccain without help from a seasoned politician willing to attack
7084265 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7084266 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
7084267 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
7084268 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy obama who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7084269 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7084270 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7084271 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
7084272 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
7084273 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
7084274 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
7084275 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7084276 i mean the truth of the matter is that that the americas this administrations policy and the surge are a failure and that the surge which was supposed to stop sectarian violence and long enough to give political reconciliation theres been no political reconciliation the reality is that although there has been some mild progress on the security front there is in fact no no real security in baghdad and or in anbar province where i was dealing with the most serious problem sectarian violence sectarian violence is as strong and as solid and as serious a problem as it was before the surge started
7084277 i think i have a much higher iq than you do
7084278 there are a lot of patrol bases and a lot of ground to cover
7084279 its going in the right direction but we need a lot more manpower we could use a brigade of helicopters and two brigades of infantry
7084280 well kill a bunch of the taliban but theyre like a seeping wound
7084281 you put on a band aid and the blood comes right back
7084282 i dont think people realize that with the rpg rocket propelled grenade fire ieds improvised explosive devices and small arms fire afghanistan has become the most dangerous place in the world
7084283 theyre actually terrifying they sneak up so fast on you

7084308 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7084318 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7084319 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7084320 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7084321 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

7084323 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves

7084337 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7084338 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7084339 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7084340 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7084341 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7084342 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7084343 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7084344 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7084345 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7084346 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7084347 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7084348 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7084349 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7084350 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7084351 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7084352 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7084353 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7084354 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7084355 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7084356 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7084357 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7084358 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7084359 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7084360 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7084361 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7084362 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7084363 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7084364 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7084365 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7084366 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7084367 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7084368 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7084369 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7084370 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7084371 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7084372 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7084373 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7084374 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7084375 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7084376 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7084377 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7084378 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7084379 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7084380 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7084381 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7084382 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7084383 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7084384 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7084385 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7084386 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7084387 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7084388 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7084389 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7084390 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7084391 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7084392 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7084393 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7084394 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7084395 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7084396 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

7084407 ich muss schnellstens herausfinden was ich derzeit technisch beim putten falsch mache
7084408 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy i share the disappointment of many hoosiers that my partner in the senate evan bayh was not selected on this occasion but i believe he will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7084409 its very likely that the obama campaign looked at the polls and said even with evan bayh and the millions weve already spent we cant win indiana obama has spent millions on his change message in indiana biden has held onto a seat in the senate since 1972 how does that represent change
7084410 vote and enter to win a trip to new orleans recipe contest
7084411 ive been able to represent my country since i was 24 years old its been just awesome
7084412 i feel this can be part of our growing pain
7084413 yes we are literally a young sport in the olympics we are still going through infancy but were not asking for mercy because we are a baby we will overcome all the difficulties
7084414 the right side of the referees lip required stitches to deal with that wound inflicted by the undesirable individual
7084415 approached the center referee and the corner judge in the competition area and physically attacked them
7084416 we will look to see what legal action we could impose onto the individual separate from the international olympic committee
7084417 the cuban was given one minute to recover himself and he did not
7084418 they gave the wtf permission to make a decision without great pressure
7084419 things have to change judges cant take peoples dreams away like that
7084420 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7084421 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7084422 the best possible pick that barack obama could have made
7084423 i think he brings a wealth of experience and he is a great campaigner and i think he is a very fine pick
7084424 joe biden has been fighting his entire career for the change that sen obama champions
7084425 he is a dedicated family man who has been an effective chairman of both the foreign affairs and judiciary committees has been a sage voice on many of the toughest foreign policy issues of our time and has long been a strong advocate for protecting american families and making our communities safer
7084426 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7084427 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7084428 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7084429 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7084430 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7084431 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7084432 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7084433 a pair of kerouacs armed with sharpies and erasers and righteous indignation
7084434 i was reluctant to disfigure the sign any further still i think i shall be haunted by that perversity emense in my train whistle blighted dreams tonight

7084436 i want some introspection but lets be realistic im never going to be able to completely create that scenario

7084448 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
7084449 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
7084450 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
7084451 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
7084452 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
7084453 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
7084454 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
7084455 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
7084456 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights

7084521 das war bestimmt kein fu ballballett was wir abgeliefert haben aber wir haben gro artig mit allen spielern verteidigt
7084522 wir haben den sieg hart erarbeitet wir standen hinten sicher und haben am ende das ergebnis ber die zeit geschaufelt
7084523 wir mussten unsere ziele neu berdenken insofern war es doch ein gl ck dass wir uns nicht bei der em qualifiziert haben

7084526 would anyone like to join me for a quiet walk for half an hour
7084527 its a challenge to be the first ones out here with it ch 47f and were still learning a lot of its capabilities and still developing how we are using the aircraft
7084528 as far as its enhanced capabilities it gives us great situational awareness of where were at and makes our jobs a lot easier it really enhances our performance and so far it has been great
7084529 we provide a service you cant get anywhere else in a heavy lift capacity we can move more cargo more efficiently and a lot safer than it takes to ground haul the equipment said spc josh miller a crew chief with co b who is from san antonio
7084530 there are small forward operating bases and contingency operating bases out there that need small parts pieces and whatever we can take them and it is our responsibility to get them what they need
7084531 the biggest difference with the aircraft is the avionics once the pilots are trained and proficient it takes a lot of the mission planning and simplifies it
7084532 essentially the entire aircraft has been upgraded to incorporate the newest digital systems and because of these systems the management of our missions is incredibly easy
7084533 our mission is to move people and cargo from one place to another this encompasses the movement of coalition troops resupplying various forward operating bases just about anything the soldiers need we will bring to them
7084534 our mission hasnt changed we are still pushing cargo to the troops on the ground and as long as were here we will continue to do so

7084541 blanket strip searches of newly arrested inmates regardless of severity of charge and without reasonable suspicion is unconstitutional
7084542 we have dangerously substituted our judgment for the judgment of jail administrators
7084543 a direct bearing on the safety of jail inmates and staff
7084544 detention facilities have a right to strip search people if they have reasonable suspicion of contraband or weapons
7084545 never showed those people who were searched under the former policy posed a threat to security
7084546 its very surreal i wouldnt consider myself a musician or a song writer so yeah its awesome but its crazy at the same time
7084547 its about a lady i know she lives in northern hawkes bay and it is true she does shoot the dogs when they worry the sheep and she hangs them on the fence as a warning

7084553 the boys had the right work ethic but we are just a little bit hesitant and not as confident its disjointed mainly because we cant apply pressure through those basic errors
7084554 there were a couple of interesting calls out there but in the end they werent deciding factors we just didnt play enough footy
7084555 to be honest we are disappointed we talked all week about coming up here and playing some footy to win a shield you have to dare to win we couldnt get our lineout going we couldnt get any structure from that and when we did get the ball we didnt treasure it
7084556 we just didnt front well enough but it wasnt a great auckland performance either so if we had played with the sort of intensity we played with against canterbury and late against waikato we could have had a decent shot id think
7084557 hes keen to go next week we just need to make sure we get the final clearance
7084558 the mobile phone as a personal navigation device makes tremendous sense

7084560 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
7084561 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman were going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it
7084562 i personally think supes costume alone makes it really difficult to go dark and we all know theres no one anywhere that could make superman as good as the dark knight was but there were rumors of the sequel looking at superman more like an angry god and if they keep that with the re boot it has a lot of potential

7084586 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7084587 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7084588 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7084589 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7084590 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7084591 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7084592 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7084593 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7084594 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

7084600 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7084601 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7084602 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7084603 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7084604 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7084605 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7084606 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7084607 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7084608 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7084609 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7084610 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7084611 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7084612 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7084613 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7084614 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7084615 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7084616 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7084617 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7084618 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7084619 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7084620 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7084621 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7084622 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7084623 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7084624 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7084625 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7084626 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7084627 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7084628 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7084629 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7084630 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7084631 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7084632 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7084633 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7084634 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7084635 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7084636 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7084637 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7084638 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7084639 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7084640 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7084641 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually

7084650 la frustraci n que se ha generado la entendemos y compartimos adem s porque hemos perdido nueve compa eros en este vuelo pero hay cosas que competen exclusivamente a la comisi n investigadora el poder determinar es una comisi n que acaba de iniciar su trabajo as que lo tenemos que respetar y darles el tiempo para que comiencen a describir lo que ha pasado
7084651 al proceso de investigaci n hay que dejarle trabajar con todas las garant as para no entrar en especulaciones que luego puedan generar m s confusi n y m s dolor
7084652 tenemos que entender que en un proceso tan complejo como es un accidente a reo las cosas no ocurren tan deprisa como uno quisiera es un proceso que tiene que tomar tiempo cada accidente es nico y cada accidente se compone de cuestiones que no se repiten en otros accidentes no hay actualizaciones cada d a no hay informaci n que se va generando cada a minuto

7084655 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7084656 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7084657 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7084658 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7084659 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7084660 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7084661 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7084662 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7084663 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7084664 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7084665 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7084666 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7084667 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7084668 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7084669 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7084670 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7084671 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7084672 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7084673 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7084674 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7084675 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7084676 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7084677 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7084678 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7084679 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7084680 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7084681 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7084682 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7084683 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7084684 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7084685 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7084686 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7084687 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7084688 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7084689 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7084690 we are pleased to announce the launch of this new educational sweepstakes during the new solar homes partnerships solar energy awareness month
7084691 by encouraging the construction of energy efficient solar communities we can help move california closer to meeting its clean energy goals
7084692 the connection was reset the connection to the server was reset while the page was loading
7084693 weve noticed the problem its true that users may fail to log in to itunes store right now
7084694 chinas attempts to suppress all mention of an album that was made in support of free expression are a vivid reminder of chinas empty promises of increased openness during the beijing olympics it reveals the fundamental contradictions of a government that is seeking to represent itself as a confident 21st century emerging super power but which also appears to view an album of songs dedicated to world peace and tibet as a threat to the state
7084695 i introduced this measure with the aim of preventing another catastrophic fish kill like the one that took place on prospect island last year to protect our states declining fisheries and the commercial and sport fishing industries those fisheries support
7084696 todays vote takes us a step closer to that goal discussion on this issue and the broader effort to save the delta and its fisheries continues to move forward i hope that the fishing community will continue to actively participate in the conversation and thank them for their support in this effort
7084697 it addresses part of the problem stopping a repeat of the horrendous fish kill that occurred at prospect island last year
7084698 however the amended bill does nothing to mitigate the impacts of the state and federal water projects as well as proposals to modify the hydrology of the delta on chinook salmon steelhead delta smelt striped bass and other fish
7084699 the fishing community should be indebted for wolks efforts on behalf of california fisheries unfortunately the fishing community was not able to overcome the scorched earth style opposition of the hydraulic brotherhood to consider mitigation for the damage they have caused to delta fisheries
7084700 the death of tens of thousands of fish including striped bass and other sportfish could have been prevented with some basic planning this bill is a strong first step towards preventing further losses to our states fisheries
7084701 the fishing community is disappointed that the badly needed mitigation provisions of the bill didnt pass
7084702 however we are pleased that ab 1806 will help coordinate and plan fish rescues in the future so a tragic disaster like the prospect island fish kill wont occur again
7084703 we need to do everything we can in the future to pass a bill that will hold the water contractors and agencies accountable for the damages theyve caused to our fisheries
7084704 the state and federal agencies are responsible for restoring delta fisheries and the ecosystem for too long fishermen and others have been disenfranchised by the agencies that are supposed to uphold the public trust
7084705 parents dont want their children using pencils which degrade californias landscape drinking water or species and the top companies on our report card show that theres a better way
7084706 those big companies that earned fs however are like the students in the back of the class with pencils in their ears and their heads in the clouds while the rest of the class leaves them behind
7084707 before we jump to any conclusions the united nations has always made clear that civilian casualties are unacceptable they undermine the trust and confidence of the afghan people
7084708 and every effort that can be made must be made to ensure the safety and welfare of the civilian population where military operations are conducted
7084709 that the lack of effectiveness is most acutely felt it is here that the lack of coordination has the greatest impact
7084710 with his leadership vision and familiarity with all aspects of the park we are confident that our record of success and growth to preserve and protect yosemite will continue in the years to come
7084711 we are extremely fortunate that mike is joining the fund
7084712 i am excited to help those who care about yosemite to preserve and protect the parks future my overarching goal will be to build on the yosemite funds successes of the last 20 years i feel uniquely positioned to continue to support yosemites special projects and initiatives through private funding and resources
7084713 it has been a pleasure and a highlight of my life to be superintendent of yosemite national park and to work with all of the dedicated employees and partners that pull together to make yosemite the unique and special place that so many love
7084714 i am proud of all that we have accomplished together yosemite is a better place for the visitor and the resource is more protected
7084715 mike is the perfect choice to lead the yosemite fund and work with the national park service donors and many others to improve the park in the years ahead
7084716 i have been fortunate to be associated with many of the parks sung and unsung heroes and to hold the trust of individuals who care so deeply for this place that they would provide their personal gifts in its favor

7084740 change starts with the recognition that while all of us need to be scientifically literate both for our own welfare and the nations technological progress we cant all be scientists that requires teaching scientific literacy generally while reserving the tools of the trade for those pursuing scientific careers the exact opposite of the approach academics now take
7084741 historically some of the most creative load and restraint schemes were developed to avoid having to utilize nonlinear contact conditions or actual part part interactions in a finite element model
7084742 the tools of today allow designers to simply indicate that that inter part contact is to be included in the model and the software defines the appropriate parameters and mesh automatically
7084743 with these advancements choosing part to part contact has become a viable alternative to questionable applications of loads and restraints in fact for most users of fea in product design a case could be made to say that contact conditions should be the first thought for interactions near areas or bodies of interest and should be replaced with loads or restraints only when the substitution is obvious or unavoidable as in the case of fluid pressure in a tank

7084762 if were surging troops anywhere it should be in afghanistan
7084763 we find it a little disingenuous that sen obama is hailing this as a new bold initiative when he has neglected to join his colleagues in the senate when the opportunities have been there to redirect our forces into afghanistan
7084764 its good to see sen obama has finally arrived at the right position but this can hardly be considered bold leadership
7084765 ignore it contain it negotiate with it or defeat it

7084776 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7084777 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7084778 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
7084779 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7084780 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7084781 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7084782 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
7084783 looking for the good of making these children accountable its for the concern of these children getting an education

7084814 when you make as many silly mistakes as we did you cant win a test match

7084817 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because our predecessors were thick does anybody really think that they didnt get what we had because they didnt have the talent or the strength or the endurance or the commitment of course not it was because there was no platform upon which they could stand
7084818 why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go a university why is it that my wife is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come after 12 hours and play football for four hours its because they didnt have a platform on which to stand

7084856 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7084857 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
7084858 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
7084859 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
7084860 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
7084861 for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of the ability to serve if elected
7084862 the next time anyone tells you that only losers masturbate or that they dont and never would bear this in mind according to most studies and surveys about 95 of adults have masturbated or continue to do so were many falsehoods and misconceptions about masturbation true it would mean that 95 out of every 100 people would be blind infertile drooling psychopaths with hair on their palms and shrunken genitals
7084863 we hear a whole lot about who should be our first partner most of the time were told it should be someone we love and who loves us back someone committed to us long term perhaps even someone we plan to spend the rest of our lives with i agree completely because you all by yourself have all of those qualities more than any other person ever can
7084864 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in q3 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly
7084865 i still think i can be in the fight for the win especially if i manage to get a good start we have a good car which should be especially competitive in the race
7084866 the balance of my car was good and we improved continuously throughout the sessions however im a little disappointed with my fifth place on the grid as i didnt make any mistakes and performed to the maximum its now up to us to score as many points as possible and make a good start from the cleaner side of the grid our strategy should help us to gain positions during the race
7084867 my best result ever so i am pleased as it has taken a bit of time to improve on my p7 that i did in my first grand prix its been a fantastic day for us we made some changes to the set up overnight and they all turned out to be positive the team worked hard to make the most of the data
7084868 we didnt expect to do this well here but its a good thing to have both cars in q3
7084869 my last lap should have been a bit better but i made a mistake in turn 12 locking the rear under braking now we have to keep our feet on the ground because there are a lot of laps ahead of us tomorrow
7084870 after our difficult practice yesterday we completely changed my set up for today then we had a gearbox oil pump problem this morning that meant i could not try it out so in a way i was driving blind this afternoon but i used my experience i concentrated very hard and i made it through into q3 i made a mistake on my last run but i am still very happy with what we achieved today im also delighted with the way the car is developing and the fact that we can always fight for the top ten and score points
7084871 qualifying eighth is not perfect but i think it was about the maximum possible today as the fuel load comes into play
7084872 in q1 i thought it was d ja vu when timo glock was in my way
7084873 its been a few races since we managed to get into the top ten so this is a good result for us wed obviously always want to do better but this shows weve made a step in the right direction and thats satisfying we had a better understanding of where we had to improve so weve made those changes which gave us a more competitive car today we have a good strategy for the race so anything is possible today has been positive which gives me hope for points tomorrow
7084874 this wasnt bad i am still having my problem of not finding grip on the option tyre so we need to work on that but i am happy that our performance is getting better im really pleased to be in q3 for the first time its a good feeling as i kept waiting to hear that i dropped down to 11 or 12 what we have seen here is that on a new track some teams have worked in the right direction and some have not the team did a good job of giving me a car that was one of the best today now it is up to me to get the most out of it in the race
7084875 it was a good qualifying for us as both cars are close in the midfield it was a shame to miss out on q3 but actually p11 is not a bad place to start the race from because we can select our fuel level ill also be on the clean side of the track tomorrow so all in all it was a positive qualifying session for us
7084876 i am understandably disappointed with the qualifying session because i had other hopes for today the race tomorrow will therefore be more difficult but as we are on a street course anything is possible in the race we must continue working hard this evening to try and work out the best strategy that will allow us to be ready for all eventualities tomorrow such as a safety car period which seems quite likely
7084877 i dont know what went wrong but i just didnt get the lap together in the second session and that was that we definitely had the chance to be higher in the top ten but it was a difficult qualifying in the end for me the prime tyres seemed to work better but i struggled to get temperature into the tyres in the first sector of my last lap in q2 so it was just not my day today i had a heavy cold overnight and didnt feel particularly well but no excuses i think the car was good enough but it just didnt work out
7084878 weve struggled for speed for most of the weekend its a new venue here which brings variety to the positions but we dont seem to have the pace we had a few races ago which is quite frustrating there were a few laps i was pleased with but we didnt make it through to q3
7084879 i am disappointed with my qualifying and i could probably have set a better time this afternoon i dont think our result shows our true pace because fernando also failed to reach q3 when we both had the potential i will now work with my engineers and prepare for an aggressive race to move up through the field tomorrow
7084880 it was a really disappointing qualifying today particularly as we have been quick all weekend my first run on the prime tyres was good but we simply chose the wrong tyre for my final run in q1 i had no grip with the option and it just wasnt very competitive for us my final run was slower than my prime run which shouldnt happen on a circuit which is improving all the time im really disappointed as we have improved the car but today we didnt make the most of that
7084881 i expected to be able to make it through that first part of qualifying on my last run i ran wide in turn five and dropped about four tenths although i pulled two tenths back the net loss over the whole lap meant it wasnt enough to go through its just the way these qualifying sessions go that was probably one my messiest sessions and im disappointed
7084882 i really tried my hardest on that lap i think i got the maximum out of the car and the best time we could do and in the end we are only 1 3secs from the fastest time of the session it just shows how close everything is now but i dont think we could have done anything more it was a fantastic effort from the team and the car felt good it could be an unpredictable race tomorrow so lets see how it goes
7084883 it has been an incredibly frustrating day for us today we were not able to find a balance on the car in practice this morning which affected our preparations for qualifying this afternoon i particularly struggled with rear locking which cost me a lot of time as i wasnt able to attack the lap its very disappointing to be starting the first race here from so far back on the grid

7084891 i came here to try to show nick i have a bit of game and if i play well i have a great chance
7084892 i had lots of chances and hit a lot of really good shots and a couple of poor ones probably due to a lack of concentration

7084900 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in q3 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly
7084901 i still think i can be in the fight for the win especially if i manage to get a good start we have a good car which should be especially competitive in the race
7084902 the balance of my car was good and we improved continuously throughout the sessions however im a little disappointed with my fifth place on the grid as i didnt make any mistakes and performed to the maximum its now up to us to score as many points as possible and make a good start from the cleaner side of the grid our strategy should help us to gain positions during the race
7084903 my best result ever so i am pleased as it has taken a bit of time to improve on my p7 that i did in my first grand prix its been a fantastic day for us we made some changes to the set up overnight and they all turned out to be positive the team worked hard to make the most of the data
7084904 we didnt expect to do this well here but its a good thing to have both cars in q3
7084905 my last lap should have been a bit better but i made a mistake in turn 12 locking the rear under braking now we have to keep our feet on the ground because there are a lot of laps ahead of us tomorrow
7084906 after our difficult practice yesterday we completely changed my set up for today then we had a gearbox oil pump problem this morning that meant i could not try it out so in a way i was driving blind this afternoon but i used my experience i concentrated very hard and i made it through into q3 i made a mistake on my last run but i am still very happy with what we achieved today im also delighted with the way the car is developing and the fact that we can always fight for the top ten and score points
7084907 qualifying eighth is not perfect but i think it was about the maximum possible today as the fuel load comes into play
7084908 in q1 i thought it was d ja vu when timo glock was in my way
7084909 its been a few races since we managed to get into the top ten so this is a good result for us wed obviously always want to do better but this shows weve made a step in the right direction and thats satisfying we had a better understanding of where we had to improve so weve made those changes which gave us a more competitive car today we have a good strategy for the race so anything is possible today has been positive which gives me hope for points tomorrow
7084910 this wasnt bad i am still having my problem of not finding grip on the option tyre so we need to work on that but i am happy that our performance is getting better im really pleased to be in q3 for the first time its a good feeling as i kept waiting to hear that i dropped down to 11 or 12 what we have seen here is that on a new track some teams have worked in the right direction and some have not the team did a good job of giving me a car that was one of the best today now it is up to me to get the most out of it in the race
7084911 it was a good qualifying for us as both cars are close in the midfield it was a shame to miss out on q3 but actually p11 is not a bad place to start the race from because we can select our fuel level ill also be on the clean side of the track tomorrow so all in all it was a positive qualifying session for us

7084929 get t thee hence and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the torrent cherith which is before the jordan ravens and the torrent just imagine what it must have been like for the prophet elijah hidden by the lord in a wilderness place in order to escape from israels hostile rulers plunged down into an empty valley for his own protection without food or water how would he survive only the lord god of heaven and earth knew why was israels evil king ahab pursuing elijah he was pursuing him because the prophet had struck at the source of the countrys prosperity
7084930 neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at not only was this a threat to ahab it was also a direct challenge to queen jezebel ahabs wife and her hundreds of priests who served baal the false god of rain and storm
7084931 send the ravens lord the lord does not intend for you to be food for these scavengers just the opposite our omniscient god uses even the unclean birds of the waste places for our good with elijah take strength and nourishment from the very bird that by nature waits to peck and pick you apart elijahs sojourn in cherith is a lesson for us in daily living under dire circumstances according to the bible there is no record of any kind of tent or hut for shelter in the cherith therefore day after long day saw him homeless unprotected from the wind or the searing sun if king ahabs soldiers had chanced into the vale of the cherith there would have been nowhere for elijah to run his life was completely totally in gods hands upon consideration elijahs time there might seem to have been characterized by two words the first is waiting waiting for the sun to rise each day waiting on the ravens to bring food waiting to see if the cherith continued to flow waiting for some change in circumstances waiting for direction waiting for help waiting for his life to be put back together waiting for god to speak in answer to all of his waiting the second was without without shelter without companionship without livelihood without worldly goods without future but not without hope with elijah we may find places of apparent annihilation becoming heavens means of secret supply the lords way of providing abundantly during dry and torturous times if god is putting you in an impossible spot dont despair in his economy there is balance and purpose for everything synergy let our waiting be the waiting that a servant of old gave to his lord and master that of waiting upon him and let our doing without open our eyes to what is really eternal and necessary god sets us apart in our wadi to protect us and keep us even as others around may be perishing him we live
7084932 therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear is not life more important than food and the body more important than clothes look at the birds of the air they do not sow or reap or store away in barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not much more valuable than they

7084935 people are going to start crying saying its a provincial regulation because its transportation related and we dont want the feds involved
7084936 yet youve got a patchwork framework across the country that is not only very confusing but is not based on any science whatsoever
7084937 its based on public opinion and its based on political lack of will to do anything about the issue
7084938 one of the things that we would like to see and were part of a national association is a little bit of standardization going on
7084939 the regulations are so fractured across this country its hard to keep track
7084940 we definitely need to pull this all together across the country

7084952 well i just want to be sure i dont call you sir when im supposed to call you maam later
7084953 the best individual to ask about that is jamie jamie and i had a long talk at the end of the season and have had different conversations during the summer and jamies got to get back to being jamie and what he brings to the table theres nights he did it and nights he got away from that hes the first to admit that but whether the captaincy has a negative affect i dont know i certainly hope not because hes a pretty experienced player hes been in the league a long time it shouldnt have if it did because leadership comes to him pretty naturally
7084954 it definitely helped that i was playing at a higher level than i had been before
7084955 it was a good experience for me the game was definitely faster and it was a different style of game than i was used to playing in junior but the coaches helped me adjust and the guys on the team also did a good job
7084956 i just want to have a good showing for myself and not worrying about whats going on behind the scenes
7084957 i did pretty well in camp last year so i know theyre just looking for improvement
7084958 i think i maybe opened up some eyes last year with my play
7084959 its nice to get these opportunities like going to world junior camp
7084960 we had a pretty good run with kitchener but came up short
7084961 theres still a lot of work to do first my goal is to make that jump to pro and then see where i end up
7084962 i think hes going to be a high energy extremely hard working guy that plays with some skill
7084963 thats what i see in him hes a pretty intelligent hockey player you can see leadership skills in him
7084964 that cuts some of the cost a little bit so its not too much of a burden on us financially
7084965 you play with guys that are older and who have been through it and you hear stories but to actually be here and experience it is something else and something ill treasure and i look forward to being here again next year

7084968 goals are a means to an end not the ultimate purpose of our lives they are simply a tool to concentrate our focus and move us in a direction the only reason we really pursue goals is to cause ourselves to expand and grow achieving goals by themselves will never make us happy in the long term its who you become as you overcome the obstacles necessary to achieve your goals that can give you the deepest and most long lasting sense of fulfillment

7084999 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee spread the word
7085000 barack obama said he wanted a strong independent leader and a strong advocate for average americans and he got one in joe biden he has a deep devotion to his family and his country and an impressive record not only in standing up for american security interests around the world but for middle class values and safe neighborhoods here at home an obama biden administration will bring the real change americans want and the country needs
7085001 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7085002 ik heb bewust alle aanduidingen die naar een traditionele vorm verwijzen roman verhalenbundel roman in episoden of wat dan ook vermeden in de presentatie van mijn boek
7085003 dat is een plantaardige vorm van het hormoon oestrogeen dat vaak ontbreekt bij vrouwen in de overgang
7085004 i have an immense feeling inside me that i can govern chaos
7085005 i see this in a sense as a cautionary tale
7085006 im interested in saying look how can you challenge the asterix and the romans kind of image that we tend to have of rome
7085007 we are determined to turn a blind eye to roman subtlety humour and sophistication because the romans do a very good job for us of being bridge builders and thugs
7085008 the greeks are sophisticated guys who go round thinking about the meaning of life and the romans conquer people
7085009 and those kinds of symbols of difference are terribly convenient for modern culture to use as you can see if you look at how rome appears in movies
7085010 the fact that future retirees will receive higher benefits than current retirees even if no changes are made to the program is common knowledge among social security experts but may come as a surprise to the average american and even to many policy makers this may be why the cbo headed by respected economist peter orszag decided to make that point in the first page of the new report
7085011 in politics theres a constant endeavour to expose hypocrisy because people dont like hypocrisy its a very useful weapon to attack an opponent
7085012 laat ik u de waarheid vertellen er zijn geen belgen u regeert over twee volken er zijn in belgi walen en vlamingen maar er zijn geen belgen
7085013 its not something i thought i was going to do but they came up with a good offer for me and im pretty happy with it
7085014 its a good change its something that will shake things up for a little bit i was fortunate to play for the devils for my entire career and its probably time to change
7085015 i got a feeling that i wasnt part of the future plans for the devils and i told lou that if i play another year like i did last year then it will be tough for me to find a team next year to get a job
7085016 i knew that if i played another year like this it was going to be pretty much over for me so i knew it was the right thing for me to go and find another team
7085017 its not that way i wanted to leave this team
7085018 i played my entire career here and this team means a lot to me and i thought i would leave a different way
7085019 but the offer i got from st petersburg was the best offer of all
7085020 we talked on the phone a few times before i made my decision
7085021 st petersburg was more interested in me than any other team
7085022 its going to be interesting to go back to where i started with my roots and the new league and new rules and the things they wanted to change hopefully that league is going to get better and better
7085023 the three cups are special and there were a lot of great moments over the years
7085024 the first cup we won in 1995 was probably the most amazing one because i was a young kid who came from russia and played in albany most of the year because of the lockout and definitely winning the stanley cup was something special for me
7085025 i never thought i would be going back to russia and i am so i dont know for sure but i think its going to be tough to find a team when youre 37
7085026 all of my thoughts are about my new team and my family we have to make a lot of decisions about where were going to live and the schools for his two children i never thought about that lets see whats going to happen in the next three years and well go from there
7085027 but i think its going to be tough to find a team when youre 37
7085028 and so i want to start by giving one piece of advice to the men when youve already won her heart you dont need to win every argument marriage is considered one milestone of life some of you may already be married some of you may never be married some of you will be married some of you will enjoy the experience so much you will be married many many times good for you the next big milestone in your life is today your graduation the end of education youre done learning youve probably been told the big lie that learning is a lifelong process and that therefore you will continue studying and taking masters degrees and doctorates and professorships and so on you know the sort of people who tell you that teachers dont you think there is some measure of conflict of interest they are in the business of learning after all where would they be without you they need you to be repeat customers the good news is that theyre wrong the bad news is that you dont need further education because your entire life is over it is gone that may come as a shock to some of you youre in your teens or early twenties people may tell you that you will live to be 70 80 90 years old that is your life expectancy i love that term life expectancy we all understand the term to mean the average life span of a group of people but im here to talk about a bigger idea which is what you expect from your life you may be very happy to know that singapore is currently ranked as the country with the third highest life expectancy we are behind andorra and japan and tied with san marino it seems quite clear why people in those countries and ours live so long we share one thing in common our football teams are all hopeless theres very little danger of any of our citizens having their pulses raised by watching us play in the world cup spectators are more likely to be lulled into a gentle and restful nap singaporeans have a life expectancy of 81 8 years singapore men live to an average of 79 21 years while singapore women live more than five years longer probably to take into account the additional time they need to spend in the bathroom so here you are in your twenties thinking that youll have another 40 years to go four decades in which to live long and prosper bad news read the papers there are people dropping dead when theyre 50 40 30 years old or quite possibly just after finishing their convocation they would be very disappointed that they didnt meet their life expectancy im here to tell you this forget about your life expectancy after all its calculated based on an average and you never ever want to expect being average revisit those expectations you might be looking forward to working falling in love marrying raising a family you are told that as graduates you should expect to find a job paying so much where your hours are so much where your responsibilities are so much that is what is expected of you and if you live up to it it will be an awful waste if you expect that you will be limiting yourself you will be living your life according to boundaries set by average people i have nothing against average people but no one should aspire to be them and you dont need years of education by the best minds in singapore to prepare you to be average what you should prepare for is mess lifes a mess you are not entitled to expect anything from it life is not fair everything does not balance out in the end life happens and you have no control over it good and bad things happen to you day by day hour by hour moment by moment your degree is a poor armour against fate dont expect anything erase all life expectancies just live your life is over as of today at this point in time you have grown as tall as you will ever be you are physically the fittest you will ever be in your entire life and you are probably looking the best that you will ever look this is as good as it gets it is all downhill from here or up no one knows what does this mean for you it is good that your life is over since your life is over you are free let me tell you the many wonderful things that you can do when you are free the most important is this do not work work is anything that you are compelled to do by its very nature it is undesirable work kills the japanese have a term karoshi which means death from overwork thats the most dramatic form of how work can kill but it can also kill you in more subtle ways if you work then day by day bit by bit your soul is chipped away disintegrating until theres nothing left a rock has been ground into sand and dust theres a common misconception that work is necessary you will meet people working at miserable jobs they tell you they are making a living no theyre not theyre dying frittering away their fast extinguishing lives doing things which are at best meaning less and at worst harmful people will tell you that work ennobles you that work lends you a certain dignity work makes you free the slogan arbeit macht frei was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps utter nonsense do not waste the vast majority of your life doing something you hate so that you can spend the small remainder sliver of your life in modest comfort you may never reach that end anyway resist the temptation to get a job instead play find something you enjoy doing do it over and over again you will become good at it for two reasons you like it and you do it often soon that will have value in itself i like arguing and i love language so i became a litigator i enjoy it and i would do it for free if i didnt do that i wouldve been in some other type of work that still involved writing fiction probably a sports journalist so what should you do you will find your own niche i dont im agine you will need to look very hard by this time in your life you will have a very good idea of what you will want to do in fact ill go further and say the ideal situation would be that you will not be able to stop yourself pursuing your passions by this time you should know what your obsessions are if you enjoy showing off your knowledge and feeling superior you might become a teacher find that pursuit that will energise you consume you become an obsession each day you must rise with a restless enthusiasm if you dont you are working most of you will end up in activities which involve communication to those of you i have a second message be wary of the truth im not asking you to speak it or write it for there are times when it is dangerous or impossible to do those things the truth has a great capacity to offend and injure and you will find that the closer you are to someone the more care you must take to disguise or even conceal the truth often there is great virtue in being evasive or equivocating there is also great skill any child can blurt out the truth without thought to the consequences it takes great maturity to appreciate the value of silence in order to be wary of the truth you must first know it that requires great frankness to yourself never fool the person in the mirror i have told you that your life is over that you should not work and that you should avoid telling the truth i now say this to you be hated its not as easy as it sounds do you know anyone who hates you yet every great figure who has contributed to the human race has been hated not just by one person but often by a great many that hatred is so strong it has caused those great figures to be shunned abused murdered and in one famous instance nailed to a cross one does not have to be evil to be hated in fact its often the case that one is hated precisely because one is trying to do right by ones own convictions it is far too easy to be li ked one merely has to be accommodating and hold no strong convictions then one will gravitate towards the centre and settle into the average that cannot be your role there are a great many bad people in the world and if you are not offending them you must be bad yourself popularity is a sure sign that you are doing something wrong the other side of the coin is this fall in love i didnt say be loved that requires too much compromise if one changes ones looks personality and values one can be loved by anyone rather i exhort you to love another human being it may seem odd for me to tell you this you may expect it to happen naturally without deliberation that is false modern society is anti love weve taken a microscope to everyone to bring out their flaws and shortcomings it far easier to find a reason not to love someone than otherwise rejection requires only one reason love requires complete acceptance it is hard work the only kind of work that i find palatable loving someone has great benefits there is admiration learning attraction and something which for the want of a better word we call happiness in loving someone we become inspired to better ourselves in every way we learn the truth worthlessness of material things we celebrate being human loving is good for the soul loving someone is therefore very important and it is also important to choose the right person despite popular culture love doesnt happen by chance at first sight across a crowded dance floor it grows slowly sinking roots first before branching and blossoming it is not a silly weed but a mighty tree that weathers every storm you will find that when you have someone to love that the face is less important than the brain and the body is less important than the heart you will also find that it is no great tragedy if your love is not reciprocated you are not doing it to be loved back its value is to inspire you finally you will find that there is no half measure when it comes to loving someone you either dont or you do with every cell in your body completely and utterly without reservation or apology it consumes you and you are reborn all the better for it dont work avoid telling the truth be hated love someone youre going to have a busy life thank goodness theres no life expectancy

7085034 in russian music you have a very different portrayal of russia from the one you find in literature which has very strong rhythms very festive images its very bright very colourful very very different from the melancholy russian soul
7085035 die de cler is 80 en kan niks andre fucking ooier is een poot dirk kuyt kan ook niks het is een fucking kakkerlijk lange jan is ook bout die kan echt niks
7085036 de kans is aanzienlijk minder maar helemaal definitief is het nog niet
7085037 i think the burning question is we think of printing as having revolutionized intellectual life in europe how come it doesnt appear to have revolutionized intellectual life in china theres no great fanfare when it arrives it seems to creep in and people dont talk about it much for quite a long time that was the problem i was trying to address overall
7085038 i always want to challenge myself and i thought stepping up to a new level was a good way to challenge myself and help me grow as a person and player
7085039 i didnt have the season i wanted to and i never really had the kind of success i wanted to have when i went into minnesota
7085040 but thats over ive just got to look to the future and worry about the here and now and getting better every day i really dont want to focus on the past it wasnt what i wanted and im just going to get better going forward
7085041 marty is going to be the starter until he decides hes done with hockey and theres no one thats going to take that away from him hes too good
7085042 i see this as an opportunity to maybe learn from the best and just become a better goalie
7085043 youve really got to take it day by day just worry about the camp now and worry about doing my best on the ice and working hard
7085044 hes going to be a good player in this league
7085045 its my first time to see some of these kids and see where theyre at right now and then the ones that were at camp last year see how far they came through the year from last year for me its more just looking and watching and seeing where theyre all at
7085046 obviously theyre very good moves when you can add a brian rolston a forward that can play on your top lines and be a guy that can be a quarterback on your power play its a signifcant transaction for you and with bobby holik youre getting a guy that can give you eight 10 quality minutes and take key faceoffs for you he has the experience obviously and hes a big man on top of all of that youve got two guys that were here and both wanted to come back and are excited about being back and also the fact what they bring inside the dressing room and the leadership qualities they both have
7085047 fedor well see how that plays out hes got to show us that he can do it
7085048 its good to see that in practice every now and then
7085049 its always hard to see a guy like that go and yet youve got to move forward his role was his role on the team and the business aspect of it thats between lou lamoriello and sarge and his agent when you have player who played as long here as he did hes been a very loyal soldier here for the franchise yet i went through this on the island you have guys that have won stanley cups and at some point youve got to move on probably that was the situation with sarge the player has to be happy in the role he has to play if hes going to play but its not something that i was surprised about because ive been through it i saw it on the island with players that youve got cut your ties and move forward
7085050 that was strictly larrys decision we knew last year when we brought larry on board it was a situation where lou and i talked and i wanted someone that had some experience as a head coach and i certainly wanted to keep it inside the organization if we could and larry was the perfect fit for that yet we knew a year ago it was kind of a year by year basis and it was larrys decision that he wanted to go back into the player development part of it with our kids that was his decision and i support it 100 percent larry and i talked about it its something that hes decided he rather do that its not like it was a surprise because if it was a year ago when he came on and it might have been only a year thing
7085051 no lou and i are both very comfortable with the staff we have here with johnny maclean and tommy albelin with larrys decision to some degree its expanded the roles of both tommy and johnny and its good for both of them i think it was important for myself last year to have someone like larry around yet it might have been a one year deal and thats exactly what it was im obviously more comfortable in the surroundings and knowing what to expect from the league and everything like that with tommy and johnny we didnt feel the need to add another person especially with larry and jacques laperriere doing what theyre doing as special assignment coaches if we ever need them theyre close by
7085052 im not saying that i only talked to tommy briefly about what my idea is going to be tommy might spend two periods up top and a period on the bench yet i havent really had a lot of discussions with tommy and johnny about it but in the brief discussions we have had thats certainly one option
7085053 thats something youll have to ask him one thing i do know is were better on our back end simply because were a year more experienced with our young kids i dont what percentage that is but we are somewhat better back there because those kids have another year of national hockey league play our power play has been improved that was an area we needed to improve on to have a quarterback on our power play that can really hammer the puck and brian brings that and hes done it for years he did it in boston and hes done it in minnesota so weve made our back end better on our power play and in other areas of the game with everyone being more experience paul martin being more experienced is going to be a better player at least it should a difference of maybe scoring another 15 or 20 goals through the season probably goes on the shoulders of your power play
7085054 possibly theres nothing written in stone you still need your veteran players to perform and a kid like corrente well have to see well see how camp unfold and were hoping some of these young kids are pushing and i think hell be one that does
7085055 ill tell you what hes going to be a good player in this league and hes going to be someone that youre going to hate to play against what ive seen of him last year in camp and just his personality and the way he is even today here in july he plays for keeps out there
7085056 no like i said bobby is an eight to 10 minute guy and he knows that him and i have talked about it and he knows thats when hes at his best when he can give you those top quality minutes johnny is still going to be a 15 to 20 minute guy whatever it might be in a game i dont see his role changing much from what it was last year we gave him an opportunity last year to be more offensive without it affecting him being repsonsible playing against the top guys and he responded to that but bobbys signing wasnt to change johns role
7085057 yes he can play any position i guess well see how things unfold but i visualize at this point in time to perhaps play with patty at center ice and patty going back to the wing but well see how comfortable they both are that will all unfold through trianing camp and exhibition games the key is that we as a group we need to have a good start to the year we have to come in and really challenge ourselves to be better because we came up short this past year and the two players we added to this team as far as brian and bobby is a real good path to be on to add those two guys but weve still got to go do thejobs
7085058 ive seen my first fight in practice as the coach of the new jersey devils laughing
7085059 its just good to see some of these kids because i hadnt seen some of them its only one day but ill be able to see them the next couple of days and then see them again in camp

7085070 als er in het westen n neiging in de afgelopen eeuw steeds verder is weggewerkt en weggedrongen naar de marges van het aanvaardbare gedrag dan is het wel die tendens tot mannelijke zelfverheffing niet alleen dat mannen zich niet meer boven vrouwen verheven mogen voelen ze mogen er zelfs niet meer aan denken hoe troostrijk hoe glorieus het geweest moet zijn je de meerdere te kunnen wanen van niets minder dan de helft van de mensheid al was je nog zon puistkop pestkop of stuk ongeluk je was nog altijd beter dan de vrouw dan elke vrouw hoe rijk hoe knap hoe nobel ook sterker nog hoe rijker hoe knapper hoe nobeler die vrouwen waren des te meer bleek daaruit dat ze ondanks al die vermogens nog steeds de mindere waren van de mannen

7085079 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee spread the word
7085080 barack obama said he wanted a strong independent leader and a strong advocate for average americans and he got one in joe biden he has a deep devotion to his family and his country and an impressive record not only in standing up for american security interests around the world but for middle class values and safe neighborhoods here at home an obama biden administration will bring the real change americans want and the country needs
7085081 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country

7085089 i cant give you an answer i dont think anybody else can
7085090 i frankly cant understand why and i assume he must have some reasons that are unknown to me but hes thought all the issues out and weighed all the factors and decided someone else is the best
7085091 making it that much more challenging to break through to those voters

7085122 that barack obama selected joe biden as his running mate is wholly consistent with his lack of experience and judgment
7085123 joe biden is hardly an agent of change he has been a lifelong politician in washington
7085124 i applaud senator obamas choice and welcome the addition of such a passionate advocate for women to the democratic ticket
7085125 i dont know much about biden but ive heard he has move international experience
7085126 its probably a wise choice because thats one of the areas where obama is perceived as weakest
7085127 hes also argumentative which is a good thing for someone in the second position it takes some pressure off the presidential candidate
7085128 when youre running you try to find something that you have that no one else has
7085129 now that hes part of the ticket that will change
7085130 they are both intellectual and will be able to put together sentences that neither mccain nor whoever he picks as a running mate could never put together
7085131 i love biden he was my second choice for the democratic nominee
7085132 he has good international experience and a long record he puts a lot of weight into the campaign
7085133 he has been an outstanding senator and would have been a good presidential candidate
7085134 i think a woman not necessarily hillary would have been a better choice
7085135 i dont know that much about bidens record and i think thats important when making a choice because obama has said he would rely heavily on the people around him as president
7085136 i dont know yet whether he was a good choice for obama
7085137 until we hear more its hard to say whether he will help or hurt obama
7085138 theres no evidence it has happened and no evidence it will happen

7085167 kijk het zit zo noodle zijn balletjes zijn niet ingedaald hij is daardoor misschien niet vruchtbaar ook heeft noodletje nooit van die rammendingen gedaan nooit heeft hij gesproeid of geprobeert zijn hokje te beschermen ook heeft hij nog nooit ergens op gereden
7085168 baasje heeft het nooit eerder willen doen omdat ze noodle al als haar kleine zorgenkindje ziet kleine noodle was toen hij nog een baby was veel kleiner dan zijn zusje en het was zelfs zo erg dat hij half dood in zijn hokje werd gevonden op een morgen toen heeft baasje hem de hele dag zitten dwangvoeren en extra goed voor hem gezorgd die dagen erna hij kwam er weer helemaal bovenop en begon ook te groeien nu is hij even groot als zijn zusje maar toch maakt baasje zich altijd wat meer zorgen over hem doordat dat gebeurt is

7085170 we knew we had a great car and we didnt have any problems during qualifying i felt really comfortable and i decided to qualify with the option tyre my first lap wasn t perfect and i lost almost one second compared with my second lap but on my final lap everything went well second place on the grid is a good basis for tomorrows race however felipe massa was significantly faster in the first sector and i hope we ll be able to improve there tomorrow our team did a great job and i m confident we ll be strong
7085171 the balance of my car was good and we improved continuously throughout the sessions however i m a little disappointed with my fifth place on the grid as i didn t make any mistakes and performed to the maximum it s now up to us to score as many points as possible and make a good start from the cleaner side of the grid our strategy should help us to gain positions during the race

7085205 her fear of black men who passed by her on the street
7085206 where decency and endurance and the pioneer spirit were joined at the hip with conformity and suspicion and the potential for unblinking cruelty
7085207 but that was the age difference and not that she was mean or anything
7085208 generally shunned the tent revival circuit preferring a straight backed form of methodism that valued reason over passion and temperance over both
7085209 blanched whenever someone mentioned the subject and hoped to carry the secret to her grave
7085210 would turn her head in profile to show off her beaked nose which along with a pair of jet black eyes was offered as proof of cherokee blood
7085211 the thought occurred to me maybe that would be a good slogan for her grandson
7085212 glenn miller tommy dorsey benny goodman harry james i dont think there was a one from that era that we didnt have at the blue moon
7085213 black slicked back hair and his perpetual wise guy grin
7085214 gramps is probably too busy telling one of his jokes or arguing with toot their version of the hawaiian word
7085215 toot notices but shes polite enough to bite her lip and offer dessert her instincts warn her against making a scene

7085217 here you graduated from college so you should be able to figure out this file
7085218 i was young and just graduated and thought i could kill the world

7085220 never stopped dreaming of a house with a white picket fence days spent baking or playing bridge or volunteering at the local library
7085221 your grandfather and i just figured we should treat people decently bar
7085222 shes wise that way my grandmother suspicious of overwrought sentiments or overblown claims content with common sense
7085223 before you came in she told me the fella was black thats the real reason why shes bothered
7085224 never had they given me reason to doubt their love i doubted if they ever would
7085225 and yet i knew that men who might easily have been my brothers could still inspire their rawest fears
7085226 than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe
7085227 she was really a very liberal person liberal in politics and i think liberal in thinking
7085228 frankly that story when it was in the book i felt didnt need to be in there
7085229 from our grandmother he gets his pragmatism his levelheadedness his ability to stay centered in the eye of the storm

7085240 when i was sent to prison i really lost hope and didnt want to do anything
7085241 because of a monent of passion i have to spend my whole life behind bars life is very much like a painting when we are in a bad mood just a single bad brushstroke by us can spoil the whole painting had i not killed anybody i would have been able to enjoy a good life
7085242 at bang kwang all inmates are serving at least 30 years most of them suffer from hopelessness and stress they often end up brawling certainly those attending the art class have shown improved behaviour

7085603 homesellers not shy to fire agents insider q amp a told
7085604 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7085605 i think they were struggling between choosing a candidate would represent what barack obama represents change maybe thats somebody like tim kaine of virginia and somebody who represents is a known quantity who does have that kind of national security experience would be a reassurance
7085606 i actually asked about that exchange when he was on my show
7085607 but one of the reasons i think obama decided to go with biden in the end is not only because he has experience but is because he really can be a political gut biter and is a strong debater over the course of the debates during the primary he was often the winner of the debates
7085608 he has served with john mccain for an awful long time and i think the obama team believes that joe biden will have the ability to get under john mccains skin over the course of this campaign and to really be very forceful

7085614 its an article from a usenet discussion on comp lang lisp newsgroup
7085615 laat 2007 het jaar worden waarin de bildtse politiek raad en college van burgemeester en wethouders werkt aan de verdere invoering van het dualisme
7085616 de gemeente het bildt is weinig kritisch geweest op de afgesproken bijdrage aan het onderwijsburo als inputfinanciering
7085617 volgens de onderzoekers had volgens een andere manier van subsidieren van het buro de gemeente het bildt 10 000 kunnen besparen reactie in de commissievergadering heb ik aangegeven dat ik het antwoord mis op de centrale onderzoeksvraag
7085618 the thing is he told me a couple of days ago that his lower arm was bothering him now the pain is up to his biceps we dont want to take any chances
7085619 rausch did not practice yesterday because of what was termed as a slight strain in the right forearm and right biceps of his throwing arm he also will be held out of todays three hour practice the warriors do not practice tomorrow
7085620 thats the problem he wants to keep throwing because hes a competitor i talked to the athletic trainer and we think he needs two days off then hell have sunday off so hell have three days off
7085621 im just resting it now ive thrown a lot of balls the condition is no big deal but i hate sitting there watching practice and not being able to throw thats the no 1 thing i do not like doing
7085622 when he threw the football wrong he was upset with himself well its his arm we talked about that hes young hes got to take a little advice
7085623 in rauschs absence greg alexander took the majority of the snaps inoke funaki served as the no 2 quarterback during team drills yesterday alexander completed 17 of 27 passes he was intercepted twice
7085624 rausch is anxious to get back out there but in the meantime you hope no 12 alexander and funaki pick it up i thought 12 had a hell of a day overall it wasnt just the completions he went to the right guys he moved around he scrambled in the pocket thats good
7085625 alexander was in contention for the no 1 job until he suffered an ingrown toenail in his right foot two weeks ago by over compensating he incurred a slight sprain in his left ankle soon after rausch was named the no 1 quarterback
7085626 im not going to stand out here and make excuses that definitely hurt my accuracy but it is what it is now i have to focus on getting back
7085627 it would have made no sense to go in the tank i have to come out here and compete its going to help everybody its going to make myself better and its going to push brent and inoke i have to focus on getting better with the reps im getting
7085628 ill get warmed up today and throw a little bit im not really going to run all the drills and everything but by monday ill be 100 percent
7085629 i dont think its anything to be worried about we just think its a strain and its not a big thing
7085630 weve got two other guys who can throw the ball too
7085631 it went pretty good i threw a couple picks there near the end and ive got to eliminate those but other than that its been a pretty good day
7085632 judging by the amount of work alexander and junior inoke funaki received yesterday it seemed clear that alexander has won the backup job when rausch returns although coach greg mcmackin says they are still in the process of deciding
7085633 all the other quarterbacks have been getting equal reps because weve been deciding between two and three
7085634 the more reps you get the more you can get into a rhythm and the more you get a feel for everything that is going on especially with pocket presence and everything like that so obviously the more you play the better you feel you get
7085635 obviously you get down inside the red zone you want to score some points but you have to be smart down there
7085636 everythings faster and sometimes when its not there you have to eat it and just take the three points
7085637 it sucks i had to sit there i was just trying to help my guys and help get them ready too i hate sitting on the sidelines and hate watching everybody else throw the ball but its ok stuff like this happens
7085638 i dont fit in real well so ill probably be in the back when we do it
7085639 which is really good news its not as serious as we thought i dont know the recovery timeline he just has to rehab it
7085640 tuioti mariner exited spring training as the no 1 right guard but in the first week of training camp he suffered an injury to his right hamstring ray hisatake who entered training camp as a left tackle has been the no 1 right guard tuioti mariner resumed practicing this week but has not reclaimed the right guards job
7085641 lafu missed a lot of practice he has to get in shape and earn the spot back
7085642 i still have to prove myself to be a right guard im still going out there 100 percent im waiting for my chance i dont have negative thoughts about the situation i missed a lot of practice coach mack said whoevers in there the most gets it i respect that
7085643 were all fighting for a job just to represent our school i take that seriously off the field were friends and on the field were just going at it rays a good guy and right now hes getting a lot of reps were all in this together but coach said if i want my spot back i have to work for it i believe that and its a fair thing
7085644 offensive line coach brian smith said the right guard and left tackle positions remain unsettled and the linemen who dont start at those spots will still see playing time because the warriors plan to use eight to 10 linemen in a game
7085645 i feel real comfortable at guard now a couple weeks ago everything was new to me but i slowly worked myself into the system im getting down all my calls i still have a lot of stuff to work on little things but so far i really like it
7085646 i have more responsibility inside when youre a tackle youre mostly one on one
7085647 hes asking a lot of questions and im just teaching him
7085648 because of an ncaa mandated waiting period taylor was not allowed to wear pads during thursdays scrimmage mcmackin implemented a no touch rule regarding taylor who made two catches
7085649 they had me going on go routes basically to open it up for the underneath routes
7085650 when taylor first arrived in town he was listed as a no 1 kick returner but those plans were altered because of the prolonged delay in receiving his transcripts he already has been admitted into uh

7085670 pero cuando lleg la s ptima noche ella dijo he llegado a saber oh rey afortunado que cuando los peces empezaron a hablar la joven volc la sart n con la varita y sali por donde hab a entrado cerr ndose la pared de nuevo entonces el visir se levant y dijo es esta una cosa que verdaderamente no podr a ocultar al rey despu s se march en busca del rey y le refiri lo que hab a pasado en su presencia y mand llamar al pescador y le orden que volviera con cuatro peces iguales a los primeros para lo cual le dio tres d as de plazo pero el pescador march en seguida al estanque y trajo inmediatamente los cuatro peces entonces el rey dispuso que le dieran cuatrocientos dinares y volvi ndose hacia el visir le dijo prepara t mismo delante de m esos pescados y el visir contest escucho y obedezco y entonces mand llevar la sart n delante del rey y se puso a fre r los peces despu s de haberlos limpiado bien y en cuanto estuvieron fritos por un lado los volvi del otro y de pronto se abri la pared de la cocina y sali un negro semejante a un b falo entre los b falos o a un gigante de la tribu de had y llevaba en la mano una rama verde y dijo con voz clara y terrible oh peces oh peces segu s sosteniendo vuestra antigua promesa y los peces levantaron la cabeza desde el fondo de la sart n y dijeron cierto que s cierto que s y declamaron a coro estos versos si t vuelves hacia atr s nosotros volveremos si t cumples tu promesa nosotros cumpliremos la nuestra pero si te resistes gritaremos tanto que acabar s por ceder despu s el negro se acerc a la sart n la volc con la rama y los peces se abrasaron convirti ndose en carb n el negro se fue entonces por el mismo sitio por donde hab a entrado y cuando hubo desaparecido de la vista de todos dijo el rey es ste un asunto sobre el cual verdaderamente no podr amos guardar silencio adem s no hay duda que estos peces deben tener una historia muy extra a y entonces mand llamar al pescador y cuando se present el pescador le dijo de d nde proceden estos peces el pescador contest de un estanque situado entre cuatro colinas detr s de la monta a que domina tu ciudad y el rey volvi ndose hacia el pescador le dijo cu ntos d as se tarda en llegar a ese sitio y dijo el pescador oh sult n se or nuestro basta con media hora el sult n qued sorprendid simo y mand a sus soldados que marchasen inmediatamente con el pescador y el pescador iba muy contrariado maldiciendo en secreto al efrit y el rey y todos partieron y subieron a una monta a y bajaron hasta una vasta llanura que en su vida hab an visto anteriormente y el sult n y los soldados se asombraron de esta extensi n desierta situada entre cuatro monta as y de aquel estanque en que jugaban peces de cuatro colores rojos blancos azules y amarillos y el rey se detuvo y pregunt a los soldados y a cuantos estaban presentes hay alguno de vosotros que haya visto anteriormente ese lago en este lugar y todos respondieron oh no y el rey dijo por alah no volver jam s a mi capital ni me sentar en el trono de mi reino sin averiguar la verdad sobre este lago y los peces que encierra y mand a los soldados que cercaran las monta as y los soldados as lo hicieron entonces el rey llam a su visir porque este visir era hombre sabio elocuente versado en todas las ciencias cuando se present ante el rey ste le dijo tengo intenci n de hacer una cosa y voy a enterarte de ella deseo aislarme completamente esta noche y marchar yo solo a descubrir el misterio de este lago y sus peces por consiguiente te quedar s a la puerta de mi tienda y dir s a los emires visires y chambelanes el sult n est indispuesto y me ha mandado que no deje pasar a nadie y a ninguno revelar s mi intenci n de este modo el visir no pod a desobedecer entonces el rey se disfraz y ci ndose su espada se escabull de entre su gente sin que nadie lo viese y estuvo andando toda la noche sin detenerse hasta la ma ana en que el calor demasiado excesivo le oblig a descansar despu s anduvo durante todo el resto del d a y durante la segunda noche hasta la ma ana siguiente y he aqu que vio a lo lejos una cosa negra y se alegr de ello y dijo es probable que encuentre all a alguien que me contar la historia del lago y sus peces y al acercarse a esta cosa negra vio que aquello era un palacio enteramente construido con piedras negras reforzado con grandes chapas de hierro y que una de las hojas de la puerta estaba abierta y la otra cerrada entonces se alegr mucho y par ndose ante la puerta llam suavemente pero como no le contestasen llam por segunda y por tercera vez despu s y como segu an sin contestar llam por cuarta vez pero con gran violencia y nadie contest tampoco entonces se dijo no hay duda este palacio est desierto y en seguida tomando nimos penetr por la puerta del palacio y lleg a un pasillo y all dijo en alta voz ah del palacio soy un extranjero un caminante que pide provisiones para continuar su viaje despu s reiter su demanda por segunda y tercera vez y como no le contestasen afirm su coraz n y fortific su alma y sigui por aquel corredor hasta el centro del palacio y no encontr a nadie pero vio que todo el palacio estaba suntuosamente revestido de tapices y que en el centro de un patio interior hab a un estanque coronado por cuatro leones de oro rojo de cuyas fauces brotaba un chorro de agua que semejaba perlas y pedrer a en torno ve anse numerosos p jaros pero no pod an volar fuera del palacio por imped rselo una gran red tendida por encima de todo y el rey se maravill al ver aquellas cosas aunque afligi ndose por no encontrar a alguien que le pudiese revelar el enigma del lago de los peces de las monta as y del palacio despu s se sent entre dos puertas y medit profundamente pero de pronto oy una queja muy d bil que parec a brotar de un coraz n dolorido y oy una voz dulce que cantaba quedamente estos versos mis sufrimientos ay no he podido ocultarlos y mi mal de amores fue revelado y ahora el sue o se aparta de mis ojos para convertirse en insomnio constante oh amor viniste al o r mi voz pero cu nta tortura dejaste mis pensamientos ten piedad de m d jame gustar del reposo y sobre todo no vay is a visitar a aquella que es toda mi alma para hacerla padecer porque ella es mi consuelo en las penas y peligros cuando el rey oy estas quejas amargas se levant y se dirigi hacia el lugar de donde proced an lleg hasta una puerta cubierta por un tapiz levant el tapiz y en un gran sal n vio un joven que estaba reclinado en un gran lecho este joven era muy hermoso su frente parec a una flor sus mejillas igual que la rosa y en medio de una de ellas ten a un lunar como una gota de mbar negro ya lo dijo el poeta el joven es esbelto y gentil sus cabellos de tinieblas son tan negros que forman la noche su frente es tan blanca que ilumina la noche nunca los ojos de los hombres presenciaron una fiesta como el espect culo de sus gracias le conocer s entre todos los j venes por el lunar que tiene en la rosa de su mejilla precisamente debajo de uno de sus ojos al verle el rey muy complacido le dijo la paz sea contigo y el joven sigui echado en la cama vistiendo un traje de seda bordado de oro con un acento de tristeza que parec a extenderse por toda su persona devolvi el saludo del rey y le dijo oh se or perdona que no me pueda levantar pero el rey contest oh joven ent rame de la historia de ese lago y de sus peces de colores as como del misterio de este palacio y de la causa de su soledad y de tus l grimas al o rlo el joven derram nuevas l grimas que corr an a lo largo de sus mejillas y el rey se asombr y le dijo oh joven qu es lo que te hace llorar y el joven respondi c mo no he de llorar si me veo en este estado y el joven alargando las manos hacia el borde de su t nica la levant y entonces el rey vio que toda la mitad inferior del joven era de m rmol y la otra mitad desde el ombligo hasta el cabello de la cabeza era de un hombre y el joven dijo al rey sabe oh se or que la historia de los peces es una cosa tan extraordinaria que si se escribiera con una aguja en el ngulo interior del ojo a fin de que todo el mundo la viera ser a una gran lecci n para el observador cuidadoso y el joven cont la historia que sigue historia del joven encantado y de los peces sabe oh se or que mi padre era rey de esta ciudad se llamaba mahmud y era rey de las islas negras y de estas cuatro monta as mi padre rein setenta a os y despu s se extingui en la misericordia del retribuidor despu s de su muerte fui yo sult n y me cas con la hija de mi t a me quer a con amor tan poderoso que si por casualidad ten a que separarme de ella no com a ni beb a hasta mi regreso y as sigui bajo mi protecci n durante cinco a os hasta que fue un d a al hammam despu s de haber mandado al cocinero que preparase los manjares para nuestra cena entr en el palacio y reclin ndome en el lugar de costumbre mand a dos esclavas que me hicieran aire con los abanicos una se puso a mi cabeza y otra a mis pies pero pensando en la ausencia de mi esposa se apoder de m el insomnio y no pude conciliar el sue o porque si mis ojos se cerraban mi alma permanec a en vela o entonces a la esclava que estaba detr s de mi cabeza hablar de este modo a la que estaba a mis pies oh masauda qu desventurada juventud la de nuestro due o qu tristeza para l tener una esposa como nuestra ama tan p rfida y tan criminal y la otra respondi maldiga alah a las mujeres ad lteras porque esa infame nunca podr tener un hombre mejor que nuestro due o y sin embargo se pasa las noches en el lecho de unos y otros y la primera esclava dijo nuestro due o debe de ser muy impasible cuando no hace caso de las acciones de esa mujer y repuso la otra pero qu dices puede sospechar siquiera nuestro amo lo que hace ella crees que la dejar a en libertad de obrar as has de saber que esa p rfida pone siempre algo en la copa en que bebe nuestro amo todas las noches antes de acostarse le echa banj bang o bani haschis mariguana o cualquier droga como el extracto de bele o y le hace dormir con eso en tal estado no puede saber lo que ocurre ni a d nde va ella ni lo que hace entonces despu s de darle a beber el banj se viste y se va dej ndole solo y no vuelve hasta el amanecer cuando regresa le quema una cosa debajo de la nariz para que la huela y as despierta nuestro amo de su sue o en el momento que o oh se or lo que dec an las esclavas se cambi en tinieblas la luz de mis ojos y deseaba ardientemente que viniera la noche para encontrarme de nuevo con la hija de mi t o por fin volvi del hammam y entonces se puso la mesa y estuvimos comiendo durante una hora d ndonos mutuamente de beber como de costumbre despu s ped el vino que sol a beber todas las noches antes de acostarme y ella me acerc la copa pero yo me guard muy bien de beber y fing que la llevaba a los labios como de costumbre pero la derram r pidamente por la abertura de mi t nica y en la misma hora y en el mismo instante me ech en la cama haci ndome el dormido y ella dijo entonces duerme y as no te despiertes nunca m s por alah te detesto y detesto hasta tu imagen y mi alma est harta de tu trato despu s se levant se puso su mejor vestido se perfum se ci una espada y abriendo la puerta del palacio se march en seguida me levant yo tambi n y la fui siguiendo hasta que hubo salido del palacio y atraves todos los zocos y lleg por fin hasta las puertas de la ciudad que estaban cerradas entonces habl a las puertas en un lenguaje que no entend y los cerrojos cayeron y las puertas se abrieron y ella sali y yo ech a andar detr s de ella sin que lo notase hasta que lleg a unas colinas formadas por los amontonamientos de escombros y a una torre coronada por una c pula y construida de ladrillos ella entr por la puerta y yo me sub a lo alto de la c pula donde hab a una terraza y desde all me puse a vigilarla y he aqu que ella entr en la habitaci n de un negro muy negro este negro era horrible ten a el labio superior como la tapadera de una marmita y el inferior como la marmita misma ambos tan colgantes que pod an escoger los guijarros entre la arena estaba podrido de enfermedades y tendido sobre un mont n de ca as de az car al verle la hija de mi t o bes la tierra entre sus manos y l levant la cabeza hacia ella y le dijo desdichas sobre ti c mo has tardado tanto he convidado a los negros que se han bebido el vino y se han entrelazado ya con sus queridas y yo no he querido beber por causa tuya ella contest oh due o m o querido de mi coraz n no sabes que estoy casada con el hijo de mi t o que detesto hasta su imagen y que me horroriza estar con l si no fuese por el temor de hacerte da o hace tiempo que habr a derruido toda la ciudad en la que s lo se oir a la voz de la corneja y el mochuelo y adem s habr a transportado las ruinas al otro lado del c ucaso y contest el negro mientes infame juro por el honor y por las cualidades viriles de los negros y por nuestra infinita superioridad sobre los blancos que como vuelvas a retrasarte otra vez a partir de este d a repudiar tu trato y no pondr mi cuerpo encima del tuyo oh p rfida traidora de seguro que te has retrasado para saciar en otra parte tus deseos de hembra qu basura eres la m s despreciable de las mujeres blancas despu s la cogi debajo de l y lleg entre ellos aquello que lleg as narraba el pr ncipe dirigi ndose al rey y prosigui de este modo cuando o toda aquella conversaci n y vi con mis propios ojos eso que sigui entre ambos el mundo se convirti en tinieblas para m y no supe ni d nde estaba en seguida la hija de mi t o rompi a llorar y a lamentarse humildemente entre las manos del negro y le dec a oh amante m o orgullo de mi coraz n no tengo a nadie m s que a ti si me despidieses me morir a oh amor m o luz de mis ojos y no ces en su llanto ni en sus s plicas hasta que la hubo perdonado entonces llena de alegr a se levant se quit todos los vestidos incluso el calz n y se qued completamente desnuda y dijo despu s amo m o tienes con qu alimentar a tu esclava y contest el negro levanta la tapadera de la cacerola all encontrar s un guisado de huesos de ratones que ha de satisfacerte en este jarro que ves ah hay buza bebida fermentada de baja calidad muy apreciada por los negros y la puedes beber y ella comi y bebi y fue a lavarse las manos despu s se acost sobre el mont n de ca as y completamente desnuda se acurruc contra el negro cubri ndose con unos harapos infectos al ver todas estas cosas que hac a la hija de mi t o no pude contenerme m s y bajando de la c pula y precipit ndome en la habitaci n cog la espada que llevaba la hija de mi t o resuelto a matar a ambos y comenc por herir primeramente al negro d ndole un tajo en el cuello y cre que hab a perecido en este momento de su narraci n schehrazada vio aproximarse la ma ana y se call discretamente y cuando luci la ma ana schahriar entr en la sala de justicia y el diw n estuvo lleno hasta el fin del d a despu s el rey volvi a palacio y doniazada dijo a su hermana te ruego que prosigas tu relato y ella respondi de todo coraz n y como homenaje debido
7085671 im on the edge of something and it would be so much easier to explain if i had overcome heroin addiction or had some other radical change in my life
7085672 my growth as an artist and a person has been so slow and gradual its hard to make a story out of it
7085673 im not trying to settle any scores my intention wasnt to hurt or expose anyone but just tell the truth about my life
7085674 everything but the writing and thats why i kept doing it its the only time i ever felt sane like a whole person who was useful who had any power who was in control when i was at bu right after high school i had these horrible panicky nights where i thought if i didnt find a band i was going to kill myself the two choices were find a band or die thats how it felt
7085675 she wore the same thing every day a leather biker jacket jeans and a white t shirt and clunky shoes with her hair in a ponytail
7085676 juliana didnt look like anyone else at berklee there was an aura about her and i was drawn to her air of mystery we were 18 but we didnt wait until we were ready we just jumped in
7085677 while juliana seems very fragile in many ways shes really not
7085678 shes a tough broad attitudinal in a big way and i dont think she was really willing to do things that one needs to do those things are stay on point mostly she made some unfortunate decisions which she would say were circumstances for instance to cancel a tour right when she needed to be doing it maybe i was a bad manager in that i didnt make her do it on my business card for years it just said enabler i wanted to be an artists advocate but i now kind of wish id gotten things done
7085679 i dont blame her for feeling at the end of her rope
7085680 shes been playing to the same audience year after year and when sales are going down rather than up youre wondering why youre even doing it whos going to buy this does anybody really care i told her if you make a record thats a leap you may have a chance to reinvigorate your career or lets go out with a bang my agenda was to do something much more refined something groovy and evocative and bring out what i thought was a beautiful textured voice which had been buried in a rock guitar pastiche or because juliana wouldnt sing out
7085681 the rejection doesnt make me second guess myself anymore i know its a good album and i got really good feedback and i realize that the music industry is sort of falling apart so i was able to not take it so personally
7085682 i say ive made peace but its like i dont want to admit that theres still a part of me that still doesnt understand why i dont get much notice
7085683 i dont want to seem like im complaining up until now i thought im cool with everything im an artist man i dont care if people buy my records but i wonder why i dont get much recognition
7085684 its just taking a while maybe ill be peaking in september maybe in 10 years thats why i havent quit because i dont feel like im there yet but im closer than i ever was

7085728 failure is not an option when it comes to educating children
7085729 as we continue to become a society that is based more and more on information and technology we will see digital needs expand business is being transformed and along with it employment we need to prepare our students to participate in a continually changing economy today business is commonly conducted on a worldwide basis shortly the growth of global educational systems will predominate
7085730 by world war ii high school graduation rates had risen to include about half of all students today graduation rates are between 80 and 90 percent but what is the world going to be like in 30 years and what educational demands will be placed on our current kindergarten students in another 50 years
7085731 kindergarten students need to learn how to learn they will continue throughout their lifetime rather than culminate with graduation
7085732 most employers today assume high school graduates applying for jobs are competent in basic math reading writing and science and that these skills that are equal to college entry level standards in order for our students to succeed they must meet or exceed the current educational standards
7085733 i also worked as a xerox representative after returning to pennsylvania from teaching in colorado i quickly learned that people dont buy features they buy benefits
7085734 when i applied this idea to education i realized that the children in my classroom learned more and more quickly when they benefited from the knowledge
7085735 you can also look at this idea in a slightly different way
7085736 i am an avid skier but i need very specialized equipment and the skills to use it in order to ski if i pick what is right for me i will be a successful skier because i have the right tools and know how to use them
7085737 setting the educational goals higher and increasing outcomes while eliminating unrealistic expectations is what we are trying to do within the community
7085738 last year we offered college credits for work at the high school 63 students reached this goal by 2013 we hope the entire graduating class will have acquired at least one college credit when they graduate the district has articulation agreements with penn highlands community college saint francis university and online language classes through seton hill university each of these accredited programs are designed to help students reach this goal
7085739 we do not want to quit the coalition and wish to go along with our coalition partners
7085740 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur

7085867 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7085868 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7085869 americans looking for a pair of candidates who are ready to fix a broken washington arent going to find them on the obama biden ticket in joe biden barack obama has not only found a running mate who doesnt believe hes ready to be president hes proven his opposition to an all of the above energy reform strategy to lower fuel costs for families and small businesses
7085870 senator obama has made an outstanding selection in joe biden delegates here in denver are already buzzing with strong enthusiasm for the obama biden ticket senator obamas selection shows that unlike the bush mccain way of doing politics obama is not afraid to have strong people around him helping to lead our great country
7085871 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7085872 its an inter generational ticket between baracks charisma and vision and the 36 years that biden has in the senate there is no one in the senate with more experience and capacity than joe biden joe biden is the whole package his batting average is a high strong batting average joe biden gives obama depth in being the no 2 hitter on this ticket and it is that combination i find to be rather fascinating
7085873 senator obama has once again demonstrated sound judgment in selecting senator biden as his running mate after eight years of an administration that refuses to level with the american people president obama and vice president biden will finally give america the real straight talk we need and needed change that we can believe in
7085874 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7085875 i know this is a ticket that can win in november with rising gas prices increasing health care and
7085876 i dont think the vice presidential pick is important to the markets at the end of the day either obama or mccain are going to be driving policy the only reason why it would be a slight issue for the markets is that joe biden is a relatively safe pick so there isnt going to be a major concern that obama has reputation risks with joe biden because he is a solid safe pick we would assume mccain will follow a similar path
7085877 i dont think there is anything in the selection that markets will look at as being a negative at all biden brings credibility a very seasoned and very diverse experience to the ticket it does definitely bring if anything a bias of stability to the presidential contest to that extent its a net positive for the markets
7085878 with a lifetime lcv environmental score of 83 percent joe biden recognizes that ending our addiction to oil is vital to our national security senator biden is a long time leader on key energy and environmental issues and the members of lcv enthusiastically support senator obamas choice
7085879 in selecting senator joe biden as his running mate senator obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of senator bidens record in the united states senate is one of support and understanding that has been unwavering throughout his career

7085937 logic appears in a sacred and in a profane form the sacred form is dominant in proof theory the profane form in model theory the phenomenon is not unfamiliar one observes this dichotomy also in other areas e g set theory and recursion theory some early catastrophes such as the discovery of the set theoretical paradoxes or the definability paradoxes make us treat a subject for some time with the utmost awe and diffidence sooner or later however people start to treat the matter in a more free and easy way being raised in the sacred tradition my first encounter with the profane tradition was something like a culture shock in the course of time i have come to accept this viewpoint as the didactically sound one before going into esoteric niceties one should develop a certain feeling for the subject and obtain a reasonable amount of plain working knowledge for this reason this introductory text sets out in the profane vein and tends towards the sacred only at the end

7085972 the goal so far as im aware is still 100 zombies on screen at once ive yet to see that goal realized myself though in any event i think its fair to say that gunplay does play a larger role in ctyd than it did in the 360 owing to the re4 aiming mechanics that doesnt mean there arent loads of dr mechanics too its just the the balance does seem to have shifted somewhat in any event i think its fair to say that folks havent seen all of the surprises we have in store for the game so ill have to ask for everyones continued patience until were a bit closer to release

7086062 this is a very general study based on a questionnaire that simply was distributed to a large number of subjects you could find statistical significance however the meaning of this significance to the clinical arena is unclear
7086063 we speculate that all these factors could promote an enlargening of tonsils with mouth breathing and a subsequent change of the mandibular growth that could promote snoring in adulthood

7086098 oh my god is that what it is going to be like being a therapist
7086099 only the true self can be creative and only the true self can feel real
7086100 it is pretty impressive the numbers he is putting up especially after he started out a little slow
7086101 i felt good before the game and then before i could blink they had five hits
7086102 he takes a couple steps forward and occasionally a step back
7086103 he took a big step forward tonight with a couple big hits against left handers
7086104 all we can do is control our games and go out and play them and do the best we can hopefully well stay in this thing the whole way thats what we plan on doing and well go from there
7086105 i still think our main concern is in this clubhouse
7086106 if we dont take care of business were going to get beat
7086107 this is not anything thats going to take a major overhaul we just need a few tweaks here and there
7086108 it was big for us to tack on runs there
7086109 in this park a one run lead is not enough its never over until the last out is made
7086110 i feel like were more consistent as a ball club
7086111 were better were better than we were before were creating chances and playing with more confidence
7086112 if i had to stay down at triple a oklahoma the rest of the year to get straightened out i would have stayed down there the rest of the year
7086113 everything that we hit fell it was one of those nights where no matter what we did it was going to be right and whatever they did was going to be wrong
7086114 definitely very very very frustrating weve got to stop the way were playing its just unacceptable
7086115 thats what i have worked for to get where i am now i am not where i want to be but i am where i need to be to move forward this is the next big test
7086116 no question if he pitches well and we win its a great story for everyone
7086117 thats the situation were in right now we need to find ways to win its good for him to be back to be healthy and hopefully he pitches well for us
7086118 the key to the whole game was we didnt get abreu out at all
7086119 he wont chase bad pitches thats probably why he is as good of a hitter as he is
7086120 probably the biggest struggle ive had all season with my stuff
7086121 it might have been the toughest outing of the season for me as far as laboring
7086122 i just want to get back into the swing of things where i feel comfortable and its not a big deal when i go through a game and do something well
7086123 i just want to contribute to whats going on here its awesome
7086124 thats kind of a weird feeling about the situation here in chicago
7086125 we lose a game and all the sudden we are down the tank i dont know if its people waiting for us to fail or people dont just believe in the white sox
7086126 theres no question that hes pitching with so much more confidence than he did earlier this year
7086127 i think when you really try to be extra fine you get yourself in trouble
7086128 thats when you put too much pressure on yourself thats something that i learned over the past month
7086129 everybody was worried about him saying he was tired hes caught his second wind
7086130 sometimes i try to strike guys out too much im a sinkerball guy now a ground ball guy
7086131 i just didnt execute some of my pitches got away with some when we score some runs it makes it easier to win
7086132 schneider every year starts to turn it on at the end and thats key for us
7086133 youve got to get hits in key situations the clutch hits weve been scratching the last few days
7086134 they really believe in themselves and what they are out to accomplish
7086135 you have seen them grow into a very good team with the same players every year
7086136 its good its just nice to be back in there
7086137 im not in the minors to feel sorry for myself
7086138 im here to get better and ive shown that im good enough
7086139 one of the better games weve played in the past three or four weeks
7086140 weve been struggling everybody knows it but were pulling together
7086141 its literally silly for some of them to sit around in sacramento
7086142 its poor judgment on their part and only fuels the fire of the publics animus toward the legislature
7086143 i dont know who is going to the convention from my caucus
7086144 what i do know is that our no 1 priority is to settle the budget and none of us would sacrifice that to go to a convention
7086145 una campagna lettorale violenta e scorretta sulla sicurezza a roma quando era guidata dal centrosinistra roma era stata dipinta come una citt perduta dove la violenza ed i criminali la facevano da padrone sono passati cinque mesi e il sindaco non ha perso occasione per vantarsi dei risultati ottenuti la realt ci dimostra purtroppo che si trattava di abile strategia mediatica dietro cui vi il nulla

7086147 lapses in guard protocol and of lenient policies toward compliant detainees
7086148 its simply astounding that it took the government over two years to conclude a so called investigation of three men who died in a small cage under the governments exclusive control
7086149 the investigation itself is what needs to be investigated along with the people whove perpetrated the disgraceful extra constitutional detentions
7086150 so they the sunni fighters deserve our gratitude and the inclusion into the security forces because we adhere to a policy that there are no arms but the arms of the government

7086179 unaccountable and divorced from presidential control to a degree not previously countenanced in our constitutional structure
7086180 that barack obama selected joe biden as his running mate is wholly consistent with his lack of experience and judgment
7086181 joe biden is hardly an agent of change he has been a lifelong politician in washington
7086182 i dont know much about biden but ive heard he has move international experience
7086183 its probably a wise choice because thats one of the areas where obama is perceived as weakest
7086184 hes also argumentative which is a good thing for someone in the second position it takes some pressure off the presidential candidate
7086185 when youre running you try to find something that you have that no one else has
7086186 now that hes part of the ticket that will change
7086187 they are both intellectual and will be able to put together sentences that neither mccain nor whoever he picks as a running mate could never put together
7086188 i love biden he was my second choice for the democratic nominee
7086189 he has good international experience and a long record he puts a lot of weight into the campaign
7086190 he has been an outstanding senator and would have been a good presidential candidate
7086191 i think a woman not necessarily hillary would have been a better choice
7086192 i dont know that much about bidens record and i think thats important when making a choice because obama has said he would rely heavily on the people around him as president
7086193 i dont know yet whether he was a good choice for obama
7086194 until we hear more its hard to say whether he will help or hurt obama
7086195 theres no evidence it has happened and no evidence it will happen
7086196 in selecting sen joe biden as his running mate sen obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of
7086197 sen bidens record in the united states senate is one of support and understanding that has been unwavering throughout his career
7086198 we only need to look back to the recent passage of the repeal of the hiv travel and immigration ban to see the type of leadership we can expect from sen biden on the issues important to our community
7086199 it was because of his determination and tenacity that we were able to see this relic of discrimination against people living with hiv aids torn down
7086200 if the support sen biden has proven on our issues is any indication of the type of vice president he will be than our community can be assured that sen obama has chosen a thoughtful and staunch advocate for equality as his closest adviser
7086201 i applaud senator obamas choice and welcome the addition of such a passionate advocate for women to the democratic ticket
7086202 the biblical scrolls are also important because we can hold the same scrolls in our hands that they held in their hands 2 000 years ago and when somebody sits there with their new testament and their bibles in the united states and theyre listening to their favorite sermon they can know that this bible was based upon manuscripts that people held in their hands from 2 000 years ago
7086203 it was a brief conversation theyve known each other for years
7086204 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7086205 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7086206 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7086207 so they the sunni fighters deserve our gratitude and the inclusion into the security forces because we adhere to a policy that there are no arms but the arms of the government
7086208 reason these states are increasingly in play is the rapid population growth among two key demographic pro democratic segments hispanics and white college graduates and the concomitant decline of the pro republican white working class
7086209 the political geography of the intermountain west the new swing region
7086210 of course demography will not be the only factor in the upcoming election presumptive gop nominee john mccain is from this region and that may possibly help him
7086211 home state of arizona his victory may not be a cakewalk precisely because of the long term trends that are nudging it toward purple status
7086212 first will the white working class maintain its level of support for the gop
7086213 second will white college educated voters who are steadily increasing their share of the electorate continue their movement toward the democrats if so that would significantly undercut the gops chances of holding the state
7086214 third will minorities particularly hispanics whose share of voters is rapidly growing turn out for the democrats given their very high levels of support for the democrats in the 2004 election which appear likely to continue in this election the greater their turnout the better for the democrats ditto for single women who have also been recording very high support levels for the democrats
7086215 the monster x strikes back attack on the g8 summit
7086216 the two of us had plans for what we were going to do but you could say our whole lives stopped
7086217 and believe me when you see someone dying of aids its really bad its different each time no one dies the same way
7086218 this aids study was it seems the beginning of many years of research being carried out on me without my knowledge or consent
7086219 if as the ethics application form states consent was obtained from all subjects how is it that i did not know about my aids status until 1987
7086220 i did not know anything about his studies or research
7086221 i believe nonconsensual research was conducted by doctors of hemophilia in this country
7086222 frustration a sense of being repeatedly betrayed there are lessons to be learned that havent been learned yet
7086223 we still live in the country that was built by ivan the terrible
7086224 people like putin they have no other idea of how to rule
7086225 what russia does now it cannot be analyzed with modern political logic it is obsolete if modern countries like the u s declare war they have more or less rational reasons even if they are mistaken
7086226 you shouldnt expect logic from a kgb lieutenant colonel anyway you shouldnt expect modern political thinking
7086227 russia is a big and capable country which will not let the west dictate the conditions
7086228 in any situation russia is going to act as it sees fit
7086229 russia has never been conquered not in 1 000 years though many tried
7086230 its because its in our genes not to allow anyone to dictate the conditions how to act where to act
7086231 theyve realized that if russia merely plays the role the west has made for it we would quickly become a country that protects the pipeline sending gas and oil from western siberia
7086232 it is too early to bury russia as a great power
7086233 what makes the situation even more difficult is that all these small nations which existed between russia and the heart of europe they have rushed to join europe

7086247 i dont know that i could fall in love with a real woman i prefer the dolls they are furniture more than anything else but furniture that i would love to live with my entire life because they are so pretty
7086248 because the love doll business has taken off and people need to be informed about the new models coming out
7086249 i think that we are the debut of a new era when it is as natural for a man to possess his love doll as it is for a girl to possess her barbie then we will be able to say that we have made progress
7086250 these are not just inflatable dolls what counts for us is the charisma they radiate and the impression of life their skin is silicone but still as soft as an epidermis they have articulated bones a coccyx human tail bone a spinal column and can cross their legs curl up in bed hold out their arms
7086251 the dolls should not smile the dolls should have a vacant air so that the owner can project upon them his fantasies they should not offer the least resistance and should mirror our dreams back to us

7086267 to us the main objective is to bring peace and stability in this area
7086268 no they leave us alone and we leave them alone
7086269 no they might encourage people to observe islamic law but most of us do so anyway
7086270 if anybody says anything bad about the taliban theyll go after them
7086271 why is the government bombing our homes the taliban want to bring peace to the area
7086272 it is because of these atrocities that people are giving the militants more and more sympathy
7086273 n o esperava colocar os dois carros entre os dez primeiros

7086279 i did not know anything about his studies or research
7086280 i believe nonconsensual research was conducted by doctors of hemophilia in this country
7086281 frustration a sense of being repeatedly betrayed there are lessons to be learned that havent been learned yet
7086282 these people have faced enormous financial and emotional hardships from this catastrophe and they deserve to know what happened and why and to be sure it will never happen again
7086283 these limits are to the benefit of women not against them
7086284 we are in politics in technology in advanced studies we are in parliament
7086285 we now have an islamic pool and we can get comfortable
7086286 the view that women cant lead cant be changed overnight particularly among the islamists
7086287 who do men say that the son of man is
7086288 some say john the baptist others say elijah and others jeremiah or one of the prophets
7086289 you are the christ the son of the living god
7086290 blessed are you simon bar jona for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven 18 and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the powers of death shall not prevail against it 19 i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
7086291 we teach and declare therefore according to the testimony of the gospel that the primacy of jurisdiction over the whole church was immediately and directly promised to and conferred upon the blessed apostle peter by christ the lord
7086292 for to simon christ had said you shall be called cephas john 1 42
7086293 and after his resurrection jesus conferred upon simon peter alone the jurisdiction of supreme shepherd and ruler over his whole fold with the words feed my lambs feed my sheep john 21 15 17
7086294 canon therefore if anyone says that the blessed apostle peter was not constituted by christ the lord as the prince of all the apostles and the visible head of the whole church militant or that he received immediately and directly from jesus christ our lord only a primacy of honor and not a true and proper primacy of jurisdiction let him be condemned
7086295 now what christ the lord supreme shepherd and watchful guardian of the flock established in the person of the blessed apostle peter for the perpetual safety and everlasting good of the church must by the will of the same endure without interruption in the church which was founded on the rock and which will remain firm until the end of the world
7086296 indeed no one doubts in fact it is obvious to all ages that the holy and most blessed peter prince and head of the apostles the pillar of faith and the foundation of the catholic church received the keys of the kingdom from our lord jesus christ the savior and the redeemer of the human race and even to this time and forever he lives and governs and exercises judgment in his successors cf
7086297 therefore whoever succeeds peter in this chair holds peters primacy over the whole church according to the plan of christ himself
7086298 canon therefore if anyone says that it is not according to the institution of christ our lord himself that is by divine law that st peter has perpetual successors in the primacy over the whole church or if anyone says that the roman pontiff is not the successor of st peter in the same primacy let him be condemned
7086299 we think it extremely necessary to assert solemnly the prerogative which the only begotten son of god deigned to join to the highest pastoral office
7086300 and so faithfully keeping to the tradition received from the beginning of the christian faith for the glory of god our savior for the exaltation of the catholic religion and for the salvation of christian peoples we with the approval of the sacred council teach and define that it is a divinely revealed dogma that the roman pontiff when he speaks
7086301 canon but if anyone presumes to contradict this our definition god forbid him to do so let him be condemned
7086302 so they the sunni fighters deserve our gratitude and the inclusion into the security forces because we adhere to a policy that there are no arms but the arms of the government

7086342 so were dealing with that too the doctors say its going to help so were going with it
7086343 i think that was part of the problem yesterday having that whole day off and not doing any treatments

7086345 sham of the councils justification for the introduction of charges to recycle at the derrinumera and rathroeen amenity centres mayo county council received recycling grants of 313 700 last year alone
7086346 we should not forget that mayo county council sells on to companies much of the recycled waste such as aluminium cans paper and cardboard thus offsetting the costs of the centres even more
7086347 since 2006 mayo county council has also received grants totalling 109 563 to offset the operational costs of the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee scheme and in december 2007 mayo county council received 60 637 under weee
7086348 the fact that the grants take into account the amount recycled to cover increase use means that the busier the centres are the more money mayo county council receives to offset recycling charges
7086349 i believe the polluter should pay and not the recycler
7086350 the majority of people using these recycling centres are low income families and the retired who have decided to take charge of their own waste disposal and recycling needs these are the people who will be hit the hardest by these fees fees which i think are unjustified given the amount of money being provided by the dept of the environment
7086351 i am trying to study connolly and make it relevant to modern post good friday agreement ireland
7086352 we are going to see more flash flooding and more storms we need to plan accordingly
7086353 there will be a 20 per cent increase in precipitation in the future there will be increases in wind speed and more storms when it does rain it will be more heavily
7086354 any future significant development will have to carry out a flood risk assessment as part of the planning process
7086355 it essentially means the end of any major construction on flood plains
7086356 of the original scheme fortunately only half managed to get through thanks in many instances to appeals by conscientious dublin citizens
7086357 any so called metropole unit that was appealed to the board was shot down 100 per cent
7086358 since then it has become apparent that the scheme is an unmitigated disaster and epitomises what not to do when engaging in urban planning already some of the units have been withdrawn having been blatantly unsafe and manifestly hazardous
7086359 outrageously this scheme has simply been dumped on poorer and working class areas
7086360 no billboards for a southside dual carriageway such as donnybrook yet plenty for north king street and dorset street and also malahide road in coolock
7086361 these units were only removed following complaints from the public and we believe others are a hazard to public safety parnell street being one very obvious example
7086362 a gross irony and disgrace that the first clients have been the department of environment lecturing the public about not despoiling their environment

7086380 joe biden is very well known to new hampshire democrats he has been to our state going back to the early 80s and he is very well liked
7086381 i think barack obama and joe biden bring the experience and balance that can bring about the kind of change that the american people are looking for in their next president and vice president
7086382 i do remember that event because each of us were presented with unh jerseys mine had the number 86 on the back of it and his had 88 because at that time he was preparing to run for president

7086390 the cpm had made it clear to the dmk that it should decide whether to join hands with congress or with it cpm
7086391 historically cpm has never sided with the communal bjp or the congress and would make all efforts to float a third front in tamil nadu that would not have either of the parties
7086392 the demand for giving back 400 acres of land is totally impractical its neither possible nor desirable if we give the land back the nano project will have to be scrapped
7086393 tatas car project would be in west bengal only nano will roll out in october
7086394 my father fasted for seven days to get his land back and when he didnt he hanged himself
7086395 we will not accept alternate land given to us because what we have is very fertile soil that gives us four crops annually moreover there is ready demand for our crops in the local market
7086396 if they choose gopalpur the state government will have absolutely no objections because from all points of view water electricity land etc will be considered by the industry and they will give the proposal
7086397 we will give him ratan tata a red carpet treatment he is welcome to come here we had made him an offer before he went to singur but during that time he decided to proceed with the west bengal government

7086411 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
7086412 if you possess a thousand contradictory aphorisms you have knowledge if you know when to apply each one you have wisdom
7086413 the man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the cooperation or consent of his deliberate reason to such a man the world tends to become definite finite obvious common objects rouse no questions and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected as soon as we begin to philosophize we find that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given
7086414 as long as the world shall last there will be wrongs and if no man objected and no man rebelled those wrongs would last forever

7086432 today the iranian nation has obtained the technology to produce different kinds of satellites and with gods help it will launch its first telecommunications satellite into space
7086433 our nation has a modern missile that can launch the second stage missile 250 km 150 miles into space the second stage is a smaller missile carrying the satellite which has very complex technical equipment
7086434 weve had it circled ive been waiting two years to play them again
7086435 weve had to live for two years with people saying that we cant defend this and we cant do that
7086436 plus does winning gold suddenly mean the americans have returned to dominance
7086437 i do all the crazy things i do out there and that is going to come to a halt
7086438 i just need to cut out some of the foolishness i do i create hype but some of the other stuff i know ive got to calm down
7086439 0 because thats the amount of minutes he was told hed play at the university of arizona
7086440 what people are reacting to isnt the loss of childress but the potential for much more damaging talent raids in the future
7086441 going over there whether it be for a few years or an entire career is obviously looking like a pretty nice option for players who feel theyre undervalued or underpaid here in the u s
7086442 the potential for much more damaging talent raids in the future
7086443 moving young to small forward means moving andre iguodala to shooting guard which takes care of the other problem in the sixers starting lineup willie green moves to the bench and soaks up the minutes vacated by the trade of rodney carney louis williams stays in his sixth man microwave role behind andre miller at the point and everybody lives happily ever after
7086444 i think this is a very good addition for us especially since were getting a player who can really help us without having to give up a player in return
7086445 with him playing alongside chris kaman i think we will have a pair of excellent interior defenders and that will make us a formidable team
7086446 were they really going to offer him the max to stay after all the injury problems thats really really hard to believe despite what the reports say
7086447 this team for the usa is one of the best usa teams
7086448 of course nobody forgets the first dream team but i like this usa team so much
7086449 they looked really bad against russia the other day despite winning by around 20 points however i dont think theyll be as lucky if they play that way against spain argentina or even greece
7086450 i think free agency now is becoming a global thing when players become free agents the team theyre currently with their competition is no longer the rest of the teams in the nba but its global so the markets opened up so well just have to see how the league responds to it
7086451 i love the style of play just run n gun
7086452 its a blessing for me to be out on this floor now participating in my fourth olympics and walking away with a fourth gold medal
7086453 weve said from day one that top to bottom we are a deep team
7086454 we just send wave after wave of players at you
7086455 we werent going to be the team to let lisa lose
7086456 you cant shoot less than 40 percent and expect to win gold medals
7086457 to us the main objective is to bring peace and stability in this area
7086458 no they leave us alone and we leave them alone
7086459 no they might encourage people to observe islamic law but most of us do so anyway
7086460 if anybody says anything bad about the taliban theyll go after them
7086461 why is the government bombing our homes the taliban want to bring peace to the area
7086462 it is because of these atrocities that people are giving the militants more and more sympathy
7086463 i think that the tailgating policies as we worked with the fan base has worked out well last year and we will continue with it this year
7086464 its not that much of an adjustment because as a quarterback i should know what the receivers going to be doing i feel a lot more comfortable everything is starting to slow down for me
7086465 he was born blind so that gods works might be revealed in him
7086466 rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind
7086467 neither this man nor his parents sinned he was born blind so that gods works might be revealed in him
7086468 he was born blind so that gods works might be revealed in him
7086469 isnt that nice that this show is taking care of these people so i dont have to
7086470 how unfortunate for these poor kids lets change their lives because were such good people
7086471 wow our distorted social policy has made decrepit schools like this the norm rather than the exception
7086472 it remains to be seen how vms cardiologists will respond to the projected margin losses from less frequent cardiac testing
7086473 er lag zo veel druk op ons ik wist wel dat ze het kon want ze blaakte de afgelopen dagen van vertrouwen maar er is nog een verschil tussen kunnen en doen daarom heb ik geen plaats of hoogte willen vooropstellen ze heeft nu 4 grote internationale titels behaald ik denk dat ze stilaan bij de groten in belgi hoort
7086474 ik denk niet dat 2m05 vandaag haar maximum was want er zat nog een beetje lucht tussen ik dacht dat vandaag het olympisch record nvdr van 2m06 zou vallen en daarbij dacht ik niet enkel aan blanka vlasic maar tia kreeg een beetje kramp in de kuit door de inspanning en een beetje dehydratatie en daarom hebben we beslist om de druk te leggen bij blanca en de tweede en derde sprong over 2m07 over te slaan en die beslissing is goed uitgedraaid
7086475 het was zalig in het stadion met al die belgen rond me iedereen van de atletiek was hier en ook de voetballers we hebben enorm veel steun gehad dit was echt sterven het was zelfs nog een tikkeltje erger dan in g teborg nvdr waar hellebaut in 2006 europees kampioene werd welk gevoel ik nu heb kan ik niet benoemen ik weet alleen dat ik heel heel gelukkig ben
7086476 tia doet nu nog drie wedstrijden en daarna nemen we vakantie z rich wordt heel moeilijk want dan zijn we amper thuis maar op de memorial in brussel zal het al rustiger zijn want dat is voor thuispubliek daarna volgt nog stuttgart
7086477 je kan echt geen goud verwachten in een wedstrijd met blanka vlasic erbij toen het zeker was dat we een medaille hadden ben ik rechtgesprongen en heb ik geroepen in de eretribune iedereen keek naar mij en ik heb me eigenlijk wat gegeneerd bij goud heb ik me dan maar wat ingehouden en heb ik mijn vuist in de lucht gestoken ik heb ook de kroatische tafeltennisser zoran primorac omhelsd die eigenlijk een halve belg is
7086478 wat een einde van de spelen we hebben veel kritiek gehad en die respecteren we maar we leggen die altijd op een hoop tot iedereen gedaan heeft als je ziet wat een fantastische laatste dag beleven dan moet je altijd pas de balans maken als alles voorbij is
7086479 if they restrain price increases or appear to they get hammered by wall street
7086480 sure well help you out but you have to be good and poor before we do
7086481 this area now has competition for heart patients all cleveland area hospitals that offer cardiology services will have to reduce costs and improve quality so they can get more of the patients to their facility instead of the others this will result in better cheaper care for the patients
7086482 i dont know much about biden but ive heard he has move international experience
7086483 its probably a wise choice because thats one of the areas where obama is perceived as weakest
7086484 hes also argumentative which is a good thing for someone in the second position it takes some pressure off the presidential candidate
7086485 when youre running you try to find something that you have that no one else has
7086486 now that hes part of the ticket that will change
7086487 they are both intellectual and will be able to put together sentences that neither mccain nor whoever he picks as a running mate could never put together
7086488 i love biden he was my second choice for the democratic nominee
7086489 he has good international experience and a long record he puts a lot of weight into the campaign
7086490 he has been an outstanding senator and would have been a good presidential candidate
7086491 i think a woman not necessarily hillary would have been a better choice
7086492 i dont know that much about bidens record and i think thats important when making a choice because obama has said he would rely heavily on the people around him as president
7086493 i dont know yet whether he was a good choice for obama
7086494 until we hear more its hard to say whether he will help or hurt obama
7086495 theres no evidence it has happened and no evidence it will happen
7086496 that barack obama selected joe biden as his running mate is wholly consistent with his lack of experience and judgment
7086497 joe biden is hardly an agent of change he has been a lifelong politician in washington
7086498 sudden violent curves generated by the crack of a whip
7086499 i applaud senator obamas choice and welcome the addition of such a passionate advocate for women to the democratic ticket
7086500 he lived a long and happy and sad and very eventful life for years and years and years before he died
7086501 we no have half sizes we no hold personal items sorry for inconvience
7086502 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to
7086503 if one looks at the credentials of skeptics compared to the credentials of defenders of the official line it is impossible to dismiss skeptics as kooks
7086504 altemeyer prepared a digest of his research for general readers which he has posted online for one and all to examine at no cost
7086505 we believe in liberty and justice for all so of course we oppose many us government policies it means we believe in freedom as more than merely a cliche
7086506 sul serio ecco perch ci provano tutte con me e io che credevo di essere una gran fica vabb allora cambio posto e lo metto a sinistra voglio vedere quante mi filano ancora

7086518 il 12 marzo 2006 a mahmoudiyah un villaggio sunnita a 30 km da bagdad un gruppo di militari americani stupro una ragazzina poi le sparo un colpo in faccia dette fuoco al corpo ed uccise tutta la famiglia di lei compresa una sorellina di 6 anni per non lasciare testimoni dellinfamia
7086519 nessuna situazione mi porter a fare ci che hanno fatto quei militari bosniaci o americani che siano
7086520 davide scusa ma non capisco cosa centri il tuo commento al mio
7086521 tu dici che la soluzione sarebbe non fare guerre beh mi pare unutopia ed allora utopia per utopia perche non proporre una castrazione di massa di tutti coloro che vengono inviati a combattere

7086527 cio significa che nel reale hai quindi questo tipo di pregiudizio
7086528 sai sicuramente quanto siano bigotti gli italiani e sai anche quanto nonostante il 2008 sia difficile scrollarsi di dosso questo tab che il sesso i cubani lamore e il sesso lo vivono allo stesso modo lo travolgono con i sentimenti e la passione quando finisce finisce
7086529 gullich anche se sembra severo lo dice perche in realta e un po
7086530 siamo tutti nati nella fogna ma alcuni di noi guardano alle stelle
7086531 e li amo per il cromatismo ove il colore del cielo dei boschi dei prati dei fiumi e del mare si fondono con quello dellanima troppe volte immersa nel grigio
7086532 vivere e la cosa piu rara al mondo la maggior parte della gente esiste tutto qui
7086533 ma si sa gli adolescenti tendono a prendere tutto troppo sul serio
7086534 venivamo ammazzate gettate nelle fosse comuni venivamo stuprate arrestate incarcerate nelle prigioni e nei campi torturate usate da scudo vivente venivamo obbligate al lavoro forzato scacciate a forza dalle nostre citta e villaggi derubate dei nostri averi e in mille altri modi umiliate brutalmente venivamo separate dalle nostre famiglie e condotte in luoghi speciali dove ci sottoponevano a orribili sevizie stupri ed altre forme di tortura compresa la mutilazione fisica e lassassinio
7086535 aicha prendi e tutto per te ecco le perle i gioielli anche loro attorno al tuo collo i frutti ben maturi al gusto di miele la mia vita aicha se mi ami andro dove tuo respiro ci conduce nei paesi davorio e debano asciughero le tue lacrime e le tue pene niente e troppo bello per una sirena
7086536 bada ai tuoi tesori io valgo piu di tutto questo delle sbarre sono delle sbarre anche se doro voglio gli stessi diritti che hai tu e rispetto per ogni giorno io non voglio altro che amore

7086546 where hes wrong is that we went into iraq at the invitation of the government not as an invasion
7086547 were in iraq as the result of a democracy asking for us to come in there its not an invasion its not a takeover were not trying to annex iraq
7086548 allultimo vertice della nato tenuto a bucarest quattro mesi fa il presidente bush cerc di far capire ai partners europei limportanza di unimmediata annessione di georgia e ucraina nellambito dellalleanza atlantica inutilmente i governi deuropa in primis francia e germania stabilirono invece di posporre qualsiasi definitiva decisione mettendo i due paesi ex sovietici in lista dattesa in parole povere leuropa decise di non decidere come sempre lo schiaffo morale inferto in quelloccasione al presidente americano fu accolto con compiacimento da gran parte della conformista stampa europea ma alla luce di quanto sta accadendo in georgia in questi giorni possiamo dire ora che si trattato dello stesso tipo di soddisfazione che pu recare piacere al conte masoch e a qualche suo strambo epigono poich anche in questo caso come sempre il presidente bush aveva visto lontano e aveva visto giusto confermandosi politico di statura superiore oltre che moralmente unico reale baluardo degli interessi e dei principi che stanno alla base di tutto loccidente nel dettaglio della questione attuale chiaro che se la georgia fosse stata oggi un membro della nato come bush voleva non ci sarebbe stata questa escalation bellica che ha portato allaggressione russa diciamo che bush voleva tagliare le unghie allorso russo leuropa invece ha atteso con le braccia incrociate che si risvegliasse dandogli modo di uscire affamato e pericoloso da un letargo che durava dal disfacimento dellunione sovietica anche se in questo caso non tanto una questione di revanchismo dellideologia comunista questa sempre stata la politica della russia la politica di una grande potenza dettata non dagli ideali ma come scrivevo qualche settimana fa dalla realt geopolitica la russia dunque fa quello che deve fare non importa che a guidarla ci siano gli zar baffone o putin il terribile tutte cose che lignorantissimo presidente bush ha sempre saputo come ha sempre saputo che dalla georgia che parte lunico oleodotto che fa arrivare il petrolio del caspio ai paesi delleuropa occidentale senza passare dalla russia cosa vorrebbe dire per leuropa se quel rubinetto finisse nelle mani di una russia anti occidentale aggressiva ed imperialista lo capirebbe persino un deficiente persino bush lo ha capito
7086549 tutti fanno i propri interessi avorio non dice niente di nuovo pero devo contestarle una certa disonesta intellettuale in quanto in base alle sue affermazioni non capisco perche gli europei dovrebbero fidarsi di bush invece che fidarsi di putin
7086550 a parte che non fai un favore allamico pernacchioni che in questo modo diventa il piu inaffidabile in europa ma oltretutto mi pare una ragione un po del cavolo
7086551 peccato che il blog non abbia il sonoro o avresti potuto ascoltare la mia fragorosa risata
7086552 e qui mi chiedo perche sono andati proprio in russia non potevano scegliere di fuggire verso sud
7086553 ok ma non in turco che quello non lo capisco
7086554 sky tg24 mi sembra molto critico con il governo io credo che solo il tg 4 e italia 1 sono schierate con il governo gli altri telegiornali o sono neutrali tg1 tg2 canale5 o sono polemici col governo sky tg24
7086555 blog su lasciare nellaltro post un po piu sopra intitolato
7086556 nel dettaglio della questione attuale chiaro che se la georgia fosse stata oggi un membro della nato come bush voleva non ci sarebbe stata questa
7086557 ci avevano detto che saremmo andati a combattere in iraq
7086558 la amberson con il suo post dimostra almeno una delle due cose se non addirittura entrambe la sua scarsa preparazione in materia geopolitica e o la sua disonesta intellettuale
7086559 un passo importante verso la costituzione di un mondo multipolare in cui centro e sud america possono avere un peso geopolitico non indifferente per via delle comuni radici ispaniche ma anche per limmensa varieta di culture lintensita di forze innovative progressiste e socialiste al governo di quasi tutti gli stati centro sud americani nonche per le enormi risorse naturali dellarea
7086560 dedita allo sfruttamento dei paesi centro sud americani tramite strutture paramilitari ed il sostegno alle dittature tra le piu nefaste del 900 al fine di avere il controllo economico e politico sulle risorse del centro e del sudamerica
7086561 per la sicurezza della nazione messicana sarebbe opportuna linstallazione di basi militari unacsur come deterrente contro eventuali rigurgiti imperialisti da parte di chi per decenni ha affamato e sfruttato i popoli centro sudamericani in nome di una esportazione di democrazia che si e sempre tradotta in un controllo violento sia militare che economico dellarea

7086599 so not like this place needs another great review but it is absolute perfection every time i have come here
7086600 this place sucks with cafe mason and loris diner within walking distance dont even bother you have to wait in a long ass line because you place your order with the cashier before getting a seat then you sit and wait and wait and wait some more and the granola and yogurt cups 8 its like 4 at starbucks for the same thing the food aint half bad but man my friend ordered an omelete and eggs benedict the omelete came out right away but the e b came out 30 minutes later no joke dont have breakfast here if you have places to go and things to do
7086601 were trying to be italy vibe but it doesnt work because there is no sidewalk outside to seat people

7086612 so i have to explain why i love this place so much
7086613 we werent confident that we could present a show experience that was consistent with the successes of prior years

7086616 after three days of a steady downward spiral in public discussion of the piece i have just given my agreement to the organizers of the leipzig games convention to simply turn off the installation invaders
7086617 seriously considering all available options including legal actions against the infringer and if necessary the games convention exhibitor involved in order to end this unauthorized and impermissible misuse of the space invaders content
7086618 the whole event 9 11 had sort of taken over my life

7086620 an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy
7086621 your sic a sociopath douglas edric stanley i hope god will recall you soon better yet recycle yourself
7086622 you certainly couldnt believe that if there were an opportunity we wouldnt take a look at that opportunity based on any situation

7086628 this is an exciting time for the group and with the huge expansion of the market we feel it is the right time to enter the publishing business
7086629 were certainly sad with the results for flagship and whats happened with hellgate because at the time we signed it we were trying to get involved in a very complicated relationship between namco and flagship we were coming late to the party and trying to do whatever we could to sprinkle the game magic on the project and get it headed in the right direction i think thats an example where all three parties had the best interest of the game in mind and sometimes the game doesnt work out hellgate is still an incredible concept
7086630 we were co publishing with namco im not going to dodge a bullet we had people who were actively working with them on the title we thought it would have been slightly higher quality than it turned out to be and i think the problem with the game was that by the time it got really good we were four to six months post release that was too late wed lost the fanbase it was strictly an issue of the gameplay and game quality needing to be higher at the start unfortunately flagship was in a situation where they werent in a position to hold the game any longer and the situation kind of took over
7086631 the guys who worked on it spent thousands of hours trying to make that concept work and sometimes we just dont see something sometimes we just didnt take enough time sometimes things dont work out the way you expect its kind of like a film with all big stars on the script it should be successful but the movie doesnt turn out as good as everybody hoped thats why eap takes a portfolio approach with its games you have to place a lot of bets and hope for a lot of hits
7086632 its kind of like a film with all big stars on the script it should be successful but the movie doesnt turn out as good as everybody hoped
7086633 we tried to sell a game by name recognition not innovation we were shocked by its failure
7086634 prongs going back and forth arcs spinning in circles nuts bolts gears wheels i see mechanical devices playing an important role in your life you may be working with a computer or you may be getting a new tv stereo or a long wanted car yes the punctuation was like this these things will make you happy but be sure to get plenty of exercise and to eat healthy remember to be patient with an annoying scorpio friend

7086645 voor het goed functioneren als partijvoorzitter zijn organisatorische gaven inhoudelijke bagage vanuit een duidelijk sociaal democratische overtuiging tact en inlevingsvermogen strategisch inzicht en bindende kracht van groot belang en je moet er tegen kunnen dat het meeste werk achter de schermen plaatsvindt en publiciteit vooral gaat naar de menden in den haag die over de dagelijkse politieke lijn gaan maar het belangrijkste is weelicht dat een partijvoorzitter bij uitstek de vereniging van leden een eigen gezicht moet geven naast den haag niet er tegenover want wij behoren allen tot dezelfde club

7086709 jeremiah wright as a matter of political expediency although for some that might seem to be the end of the controversy the question still remains how could barack obama hold jeremiah wright in such high esteem for so long unless he agreed with wrights positions on at least some basic level

7086715 with a certain bewilderment no german politician would come up with the idea to do such a thing at the national mall in d c
7086716 lots of speculation on the web and in whispering circles about why obamas foreign trip a slam dunk success substantively and in photo op terms hasnt resulted in a polling bump the emerging conventional wisdom seems to be that the trip is a bit too grand too presumptuous and voters are wary of that
7086717 sees an america in which the cup is half empty
7086718 i decided i wont wear that flag pin on my chest instead im going to try to tell the american people what i believe will make this country great and hopefully that will be a testimony to my patriotism

7086726 the statements that rev wright made that are the cause of this controversy were not statements i personally heard him preach while i sat in the pews of trinity or heard him utter in private conversation
7086727 i have already condemned in unequivocal terms the statements of reverend wright that have caused such controversy did i ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while i sat in church yes
7086728 in the last week barack obama has handed progressives a string of stinging rebukes
7086729 am i bummed that obama and most of our democratic leaders caved in on fisa absolutely and theres nothing wrong with saying so
7086730 his policies on an iraq timeline for withdrawal which drew the immediate ire of liberals nationwide
7086731 let me be as clear as i can be i intend to end this war my first day in office i will bring the joint chiefs of staff in and i will give them a new mission and that is to end this war responsibly deliberately but decisively
7086732 dont worry its just campaign rhetoric dont take it seriously
7086733 john mccain wants to continue a war in iraq perhaps as long as 100 years
7086734 i would have a strike force in the region perhaps in iraq thats very different from saying wed have a permanent occupation in iraq and its certainly different from saying we would have a high level of combat troops inside iraq for a decade or two decades or as john mccain said perhaps 100 years
7086735 president bush has talked about our staying for 50 years maybe 100 weve been in japan for 60 years in south korea for 50 years or so that would be fine with me
7086736 the only candidate who isnt taking a dime from washington lobbyists
7086737 not so much lies as a sort of slippery sleight of mouth

7086741 my mother who i think had as much influence on my values as anybody was not someone who wore her religion on her sleeve wed go to church for easter she wasnt a church lady
7086742 she touted herself as an atheist and it was something shed read about and could argue
7086743 my mothers confidence in needlepoint virtues depended on a faith i didnt possess a faith that she would refuse to describe as religious that in fact her experience told her was sacrilegious a faith that rational thoughtful people could shape their own destiny
7086744 i dont presume to have knowledge of what happens after i die
7086745 you know my faith is one that admits some doubt
7086746 values that move us forward ie progressivism and theres an obligation for all of us individually as well as collectively ie collectivism to take responsibility to make those values lived
7086747 it is the duty of our christian nation to select and prefer christians for their rulers

7086764 the milf said the signing of the moa is just a formality
7086765 what would be the effect of our ruling to the milf
7086766 can you cite a case where a person has been prohibited from exercising a legal right
7086767 the problem here is that there is no consummated act yet why cant you wait for the signing of the agreement
7086768 we dont want to get the impression that only anti moa people reside in mindanao
7086769 the reason for the request was that there were interventions filed and we were not even asked to file comments that is part of due process we shouldnt be going to court unless we have inputs
7086770 on matter of due process when petition is filed against the law provides that the other party should be given the right to be heard the government is like any other ordinary citizen who should be given the chance to be heard which is missing on this case
7086771 the moa ad is flawed in the process just as it is flawed in its provisions what was lost in the process was an appreciation for legitimacy in a democracy that stems from winning consensus including the consent of the governed
7086772 the moa violates many provisions of the constitution which strangely enough the memorandum never mentions by name
7086773 you filed on july 21 before the office of presiding justice conrado vazquez a pleading denominated as interpleader what rules are governed by this interpleader petition

7086775 ah so now its not a letter anymore but a memorandum which is it you said you memorized the irca internal rules of the court of appeals and yet you dont know the rules of court
7086776 we are not talking about the substance it was made to appear that there was a transcript made on the deliberation when it fact it was drawn from his memory
7086777 you say you prepared it out of memory you must have a very photographic memory because page three of the transcript has 225 words i counted it page four has 454 words fantastic memory
7086778 i told her that i will get it back which i did get it back she was with me in the decision beforehand shes a very nice lady before
7086779 why are you stressing that she is a nice lady before or after or whatever
7086780 she simply asked can i read it to me it was a very harmless request
7086781 when i gave her vidal the copy there was no rollo involved and no official receipt meaning it was unofficial
7086782 she being a nice lady you cannot refuse her but you told her to sign it
7086783 i only gave her vidal an hour or two to read the decision and i had to get it back immediately
7086784 you are under oath there was no request never never did i request you to allow me to have a peek at your decision it has all the earmarks of a final decision you carry it in an expensive looking bag it also has the earmarks of a final decision as a matter of fact there are three copies of the decision and there is also a certification that i concur in that decision
7086785 your series of lies only pinpoint to your lack of credibility
7086786 looking worried and asked if i signed it the document
7086787 after the close of officer hour he came back looking worried and asked me if i signed it i said yes and he left at once but with instruction that he will pick it up the next day now i have a reason to believe that that is a final decision and he is just weaving his lies in order to cover up and escape
7086788 it doesnt appear that they were particularly wealthy detective inspector mark newham said
7086789 were just devastated they have absolutely devastated our family she said
7086790 they have taken away a mother a father a nan and a pop
7086791 dear mum and dad we love you we miss you forever together garry and karen
7086792 there are a lot of rumours in town obviously people talk about it but its our job to determine whether they are just rumours or what may have some truth to it he said
7086793 it often begins with the strange gaze then a volley of emotions so tumultuous that you break down the plot is complete the self denial begins
7086794 when michael rang me last tuesday i was on my way to new zealand
7086795 he said dad youve got to come and see me
7086796 i said to my wife maybe the doctors have told him hes only got a few weeks to live
7086797 so we cancelled everything and jumped on the plane and went to see him in melbourne and thats when he told us the story
7086798 we were just in absolute shock and we still are we havent had time to get our head around it he said i dont have cancer ive had two lives that ive lived
7086799 his wife amanda who has been with him for seven years found out the day before we did and shes had no idea
7086800 michael has had a severe addiction to pornography the addiction to pornography started when he was 12
7086801 its horrendous because we dont have that sort of stuff around he was raised in a christian home weve never brought that stuff into our home
7086802 he lived the two lives and he would get sick as a result of the guilt
7086803 he was feeling like he was letting god down letting his family down his church his friends
7086804 hes been living this for so long feeling like hes had these two lives and now hes the one thats come out in the open he confessed it he didnt get caught
7086805 to deal with the guilt he would pour himself into doing good work hes touched the lives of young people all over the world now they are all affected by this
7086806 he hasnt done this for any reasons that have been portrayed that hes a fraud
7086807 it was either keep pretending or come out with the truth and tell everything hes come out with everything but now weve got the consequences of it all
7086808 we have to accept it were hoping to share with our congregation how it all started and how it got where it is
7086809 an addiction like this is not going to be fixed overnight you cant have a 16 year problem and fix it in a week
7086810 they have said to me that he is very ill they are assessing where reality stopped and fantasy kicked in and whats caused all this
7086811 the doctor believes that at times michael was totally convinced that he had this sickness
7086812 when he was about 12 he did vomit all the time hed get really really sick
7086813 he was in the adelaide childrens hospital for seven weeks at one stage he didnt eat and we thought we were going to lose him
7086814 they took out his appendix thinking that it might be that but they realised that it wasnt
7086815 they gave us the option of putting him in a psychiatric ward to see if there was something psychological but we felt uncomfortable with that at the time
7086816 we signed him out from hospital and then he would go a few months and then he would get sick again
7086817 wed always take him to hospital wed always do the proper thing but they couldnt get to the bottom of it until now
7086818 we have watched our son go through what we thought was cancer
7086819 my wife and i over the past two years have watched him vomit in buckets having nosebleeds and even his hair fell out in clumps at one stage
7086820 every time we saw him we saw symptoms he stayed with us for a while where we had to put a special air conditioner in one of the rooms because he would heat up so much in the middle of winter
7086821 he had this cold air conditioner blowing on him to try to keep the heat down as a professional minister ive stood in front of my congregation and cried and said to pray for my son
7086822 ive travelled the world asking people to pray for him can you imagine what a horrible thing it would be if i was playing a game
7086823 to be honest i ask myself as a father what did i miss what did i not do

7087016 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
7087017 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
7087018 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
7087019 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
7087020 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise

7087034 we really see that teams in the future will be less dogmatic about what particular process ideology they need to follow and will be more focused on using different ideas to get the results they need well see all sorts of interesting process mashups as people combine different process ideas on their own projects to reach their particular goals for that particular project
7087035 over the summer mashup will explore what really happens when cultures intersect in love at work and at play youll hear from immigrants second generation canadians mixed race canadians people whove been in canada for decades each with a personal story about how cultures collide in their daily lives canada is a country of mashups people from different cultures find themselves living and working together here bumping into different values assumptions and different ways of doing things
7087036 i think its important to remember that waterfall and agile arent the only two options
7087037 does the tool suck or do we need more practice or training with it

7087039 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7087040 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7087041 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7087042 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7087043 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7087044 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area

7087064 a runner like usain bolt comes along once every 100 years

7087068 on thursday as the convention moves from the indoor pepsi center to mile high an open air football stadium democrats will have to balance their desire to spotlight obamas enthusiastic following with concern that images of a cheering throng will ratify republican attacks on the candidate as a glitzy but untested celebrity
7087069 you know what lets just leave the whole military record thing alone
7087070 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7087071 when we look at grains in general i think fertiliser has gone up by an average of about a hundred percent
7087072 fuel for farmers has more than doubled and if you talk of herbicides and pesticides were looking at an increase of between 40 60 percent
7087073 with a situation like that and prices always likely to go up you would normally expect farmers to be smiling but that isnt the case
7087074 the increase in costs definitely erodes the benefits from prices and higher output
7087075 the south african reserve bank said in its monetary policy statement last week
7087076 what were trying to get from the government at the moment is a safety net to subsidise insurance schemes for input costs so that the farmers can cover their input costs if there is a disaster for example
7087077 its been really rewarding for us to see him outside like this and so healthy were proud of the progress hes made
7087078 when he first came to us he was very thin for his length
7087079 weve estimated hes about 3 or 4 years old but its hard to tell since his growth rate was altered by his limited environment and poor nutrition
7087080 he was so weak when he got here he could barely take two steps his muscles had atrophied pretty badly and he was frightened he had never been in sunshine and grass before and he just stayed huddled up against the wall behind the tortoise exhibit it took a good two months to get him strong enough that we felt he could go outside and walk through the grass like this
7087081 not only could such an animal pose a danger but most people dont have the resources to keep an animal like this the proper environment or food
7087082 they have no idea how to care for it the animal grows bigger than they expected and then ends up in a bad situation or let loose which poses other problems
7087083 we had to get two catch poles to put around the neck and tail
7087084 he was scared so it wasnt an easy task then we were able to get him in one of the cages in the animal control van and we brought him to the zoo
7087085 there really arent that many places around here to rehab an alligator
7087086 its like taking a person out of new york city and throwing him in the rain forest
7087087 he wouldnt know sources of food or how to survive
7087088 it appears as though they had a platonic relationship that went back 20 years
7087089 to us the main objective is to bring peace and stability in this area

7087091 no they might encourage people to observe islamic law but most of us do so anyway
7087092 if anybody says anything bad about the taliban theyll go after them
7087093 why is the government bombing our homes the taliban want to bring peace to the area
7087094 it is because of these atrocities that people are giving the militants more and more sympathy

7087115 but after that we did not play well and we allowed them to control our attacks they did not create too much themselves but it was not a good performance from our team
7087116 then in the second half they scored a good goal and we had to throw people forward to get ourselves back in the game
7087117 but it was gerrard who showed the winning mentality he has done that so many times from a similar position many other players would have put it high over the bar but you know gerrard will hit the target

7087129 when we see him on television his speeches sound good
7087130 our state has been battered by the policies of the bush administration so it matters to us that senator biden has a long standing reputation of bringing real results that matter to americans
7087131 it also matters that his track record on foreign policy will be invaluable to the new administration in helping to secure our nations place in the world

7087287 for people with obesity and reflux together the gastric bypass procedure appears to be effective not only for weight loss but also for the control of reflux symptoms
7087288 because in this case most of the acid from the stomach is being partitioned away so it doesnt have exposure to the esophagus
7087289 however with gastric banding the problem is that you actually create a pocket which acid has the ability to fill from the remainder portion of the stomach
7087290 and this acid can just sit there above the band and make its way back up to the esophagus this can cause reflux disease to develop or make it worse than it had been if it was a problem before the procedure
7087291 gastric bypass is the most common and the most successful of the surgical procedures to deal with obesity
7087292 but the advantage to the banding procedure is that although it will not be an effective option for all patients depending on the level of obesity its a lot less aggressive than bypass and has a lot less morbidity associated with it and its much more reversible so there are reasons some patients might choose that option
7087293 both bypass and banding are not without their set of complications and this study illustrates that while solving one problem perhaps you worsen another so i would say that if youre going into any of these procedures to deal with obesity and you have significant reflux you definitely first need to have an appropriate evaluation as if you were considering an anti reflux procedure

7087302 has the upper hand in colors available and shoessmaster has zero feedback and says not to purchase his items if you have
7087303 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7087304 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic yeah
7087305 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7087306 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off
7087307 even william hartnell who played the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines i think hell always probably tend to be around 40
7087308 dit is niet zo maar een pakje dit is lingerie
7087309 de eerste keer dat wij naar new york gingen acht of negen jaar geleden kocht ik dit zij heeft het nooit gebruikt zij wilde het voor een speciale gelegenheid bewaren ik geloof dat dit wel het goede moment is
7087310 bewaar niets voor een speciale gelegenheid iedere dag dat je leeft is een speciale gelegenheid
7087311 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
7087312 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
7087313 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
7087314 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
7087315 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
7087316 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
7087317 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
7087318 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
7087319 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
7087320 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
7087321 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
7087322 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
7087323 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write
7087324 if statistics are any indication the system may well be allowing some innocent defendants to be executed
7087325 as long as it was great and fantastic then yeah but a film is on for 90 minutes and that is not as important as the series but as long as it doesnt get in the way of the show we could do it
7087326 i would not rule out a film version of doctor who no
7087327 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7087328 shut up just shut up it is easy to find out whats going on with the show we virtually publish the scripts and we film in public
7087329 but in giving things away you become that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7087330 the show is really tough for a superfit david tennant so you might kill somebody who takes on the role in their 60s for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7087331 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7087332 oh he he wasnt hurt as badly as we were led to believe
7087333 this will really help us under the cap if we say
7087334 we really hope he doesnt sign anywhere else because that would hurt us

7087372 we were a bit disappointed with the way we handled the situation there dambulla
7087373 we wanted to execute certain plans which we couldnt but that game has gone the wicket and conditions are different here and all the batsmen are ready for the challenge
7087374 it is a different wicket and looks firm the ball will probably come nicely on to the bat so definitely there will be more runs it is all about getting used to the conditions and the performance on the day
7087375 in one day cricket bowlers do come into the play create opportunities and put pressure but batsmen have more responsibility as they are the ones who control the game because runs on the board are vital
7087376 he has been bowling for the last two days and looking good right now he has a very good chance of playing the match on sunday
7087377 he and murali have been doing the job for us for a long time to get 400 wickets is a great achievement
7087378 both the young players virat kohli and badrinath played really well in the last match
7087379 it was good to see young players coming in and feeling comfortable in the international set up its very important for indian cricket that we have competition for places
7087380 we are discussing various combinations at the moment and would like to be pretty flexible we will take it game by game
7087381 its been really rewarding for us to see him outside like this and so healthy were proud of the progress hes made
7087382 when he first came to us he was very thin for his length
7087383 weve estimated hes about 3 or 4 years old but its hard to tell since his growth rate was altered by his limited environment and poor nutrition
7087384 he was so weak when he got here he could barely take two steps his muscles had atrophied pretty badly and he was frightened he had never been in sunshine and grass before and he just stayed huddled up against the wall behind the tortoise exhibit it took a good two months to get him strong enough that we felt he could go outside and walk through the grass like this
7087385 not only could such an animal pose a danger but most people dont have the resources to keep an animal like this the proper environment or food
7087386 they have no idea how to care for it the animal grows bigger than they expected and then ends up in a bad situation or let loose which poses other problems
7087387 we had to get two catch poles to put around the neck and tail
7087388 he was scared so it wasnt an easy task then we were able to get him in one of the cages in the animal control van and we brought him to the zoo
7087389 there really arent that many places around here to rehab an alligator
7087390 its like taking a person out of new york city and throwing him in the rain forest
7087391 he wouldnt know sources of food or how to survive
7087392 on monday i received 2 pem girls from a puppy mill the baby a tri puppy about 9 weeks old has both patellas completely luxated she gets around easily and happily in a bunny hop but likely we can have the patellas repaired if anybody has knowledge of congenital luxated patellas id love to learn more she is a sweet loving puppy and has my guys wrapped around her paw the older girl is who really worries me she is 3 1 2 years old and until monday never had a name she is 29 about 5 too much although apparently she has already lost a lot of weight has much loose skin and her bib is stained pink im guessing from drooling because of panting so much from being so heavy she is completely harmless but not in a good way i dont see a dog behind those sweet eyes she has submitted to vetting a bath and toenail trim without struggle she will briefly romp with the dogs in the yard but when i reach out to her she freezes like a frightened rabbit she has hardly eaten more than 2 mouthfuls in 3 days she will not come out of her crate nor will she come into the house once shes been out when she is in the house she goes right back into the back of her crate or squeezes herself into the tiniest corner she can find if the crate is closed she will not take food from your hand she will not move if you put a lead on her im conflicted on how to approach this do i force her to be socialized take her to dog school with the others to watch have lots of people touch her not allow her to shut herself off from the world or am i asking too much and i should let her do what she needs to be comfortable i dont want to traumatize any more than she already has been but i am not giving up on this sweet girl she deserves more

7087397 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7087398 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7087399 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7087400 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7087401 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7087402 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7087403 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7087404 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7087405 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7087406 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7087407 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7087408 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7087409 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7087410 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7087411 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7087412 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7087413 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7087414 a terrific choice for vice president of the united states and we are thrilled that sen obama has tapped him as our partys nominee
7087415 sen biden will be a tremendous partner for sen obama and for michigan our state has been battered by the policies of the bush administration so it matters to us that sen biden has a long standing reputation of bringing real results that matter to americans it also matters that his track record on foreign policy will be invaluable to the new administration in helping to secure our nations place in the world
7087416 and told him we want to see him here we need to see obama and biden and a lot of them
7087417 older voters catholic ethnic voters need to know that core democrats like joe biden are supporting barack obama
7087418 hes a father a catholic and someone with a lot of experience hes no nonsense no fluff and when he comes here to michigan he will be able to connect with the voters and supplement what barack obama is already doing in michigan
7087419 independent voters and reagan democrats in particular are raising questions about barack obama is he ready is it worth the risk is this the type of thing you have to do
7087420 and when you have a candidate like joe biden who has actually said all the same things we are saying he helps make our case
7087421 i am sure that sen bidens experience is going to help
7087422 if this is the person sen obama thinks he can work well with that they can be a united team then the rest of us should unite behind the team as well
7087423 an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7087424 this is a terrific choice joe biden understands the challenges facing our country at home and abroad and his long history of bipartisanship in the senate will be a welcome asset he will be a tireless and enthusiastic partner for senator obama in the campaign and in the white house
7087425 complements obama and at the same time he is not someone who is a yes man someone who has been around to be able to challenge
7087426 obama has pushed the message of change but he reaches back to washington business as usual how do you push change with a guy who is one of the longest serving stakeholders in washington something doesnt seem to add up its not change i can believe in

7087433 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7087434 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7087435 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7087436 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7087437 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7087438 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7087439 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better

7087441 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7087442 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7087443 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run

7087445 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7087446 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7087447 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make

7087484 for 14 years you have filled my soul with fear despondency and loneliness watching you looming on the altar of the pro cathedral or in a sermon droning i feel as if i am in an airbus at 36 000 feet in the vicinity of the north pole your countenance and your vocabulary constitute snow white desolation vast empty tundra eternally wailing emptiness
7087485 we have been shattered by this people were crying last sunday realising that we will no longer be able to come here
7087486 i have a very special memory that happened at this church
7087487 it would be such a shame if you do close the church
7087488 this area is crying out to be supported but we feel that he has treated us like peasants rather than listening to what we have to say
7087489 he has been grossly negligent in regard to running this parish
7087490 has failed to act in the interests of the charity and its beneficiaries the parishioners and clergy
7087491 closing these churches is the last thing that the bishop wants to do but he had no choice
7087492 we have had a consultation the case was put to them and thats it congregations of 200 arent viable any more

7087551 what is more there are good reasons for thinking that medical tourism will help poor countries for one thing private hospitals did not cause the state sectors neglect of the poorest long before medical tourism or private hospitals took off the state run hospitals of india and most other developing countries were a shambles this was chiefly the result of bureaucratic incompetence and corruption not poverty as the decent health care systems in other developing countries like costa rica malaysia and even cuba make clear besides the rising standards at private facilities promise to have important knock on effects that may benefit even the poor the world bank has observed that the rise of high quality private clinics in trinidad and other parts of the caribbean for example has encouraged highly educated doctors to return home
7087552 a disruptive market force that improves cost and quality here in america
7087553 there are a lot of people out there who want the job im not one of them i wouldnt say no i hope he doesnt ask me
7087554 ill say yes to that idea but not because it is already running or anything
7087555 ma per colmare il divario col nord la sicilia dovr pedalare
7087556 anche io come i suoi sostenitori sono deluso da veltroni e suddito di frange giustizialiste
7087557 at least 70 innocent civilians most of them women and children
7087558 i found a russia on the move a russia that is trying to intimidate its neighbors who are democratic in nature
7087559 this georgia conflict is not about a border dispute its about the desire by russia to send a signal to its democratic neighbors that russia is a dominant power
7087560 i told mccain that there was unity in georgia russia is doing a lot of damage the poles and ukraine see this as a very big step in the wrong direction by russia
7087561 basically that your view john of russia being up to no good is correct
7087562 we cannot sit on the sidelines and allow energy supplies to be controlled by russia
7087563 we cant allow these young democracies to be intimidated by russia
7087564 it is clear that the russians tried to create this provocation
7087565 they were looking for this opening theyre trying to lure these young democracies into a fight
7087566 its not about our fear its about the people waiting in gaza you cant think about anything else
7087567 the siege that the israelis have imposed on gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law it is also immoral global institutions and the governments of the world know what is happening and are not doing anything about it
7087568 if israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships we will not forcibly resist
7087569 if we are arrested and brought to israel we will protest and prosecute our kidnapping in the appropriate forums it is our purpose to show the power that ordinary citizens have when they organise to stand against injustice
7087570 seventy six people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred during the operation by coalition forces in shindand district of herat province
7087571 nineteen women seven men and the rest children all under 15 years of age
7087572 this is not the first time hamid karzai the afghan president has made repeated calls for nato to stop air strikes
7087573 with either good or bad intelligence the most important lesson to learn from this is that we need to rely more on ground troops
7087574 since nato and the coalition dont have these troops the reliance on air support is greater so if they can increase their ground operations it would probably alleviate some of these problems
7087575 this is a civilian house and regretfully when a bombing takes place an aerial bombing or any kind of smart bombing definitely you will have these kind of regretful casualities
7087576 planes bombed the area and in the result 25 taliban were killed including two famous commanders
7087577 unfortunately five civilians were killed and one woman and a boy were wounded
7087578 during the operation more than 30 militants were killed and a large cache of mortar rounds and ied improvised explosive device materials were destroyed by the commandos
7087579 weve all got a kind of love hate relationship with the university of washington
7087580 affects the health safety or security of any member of the university community or the mission of the university
7087581 we have a responsibility to educate our students about being responsible citizens
7087582 led the university to start taking a more proactive approach to curbing off campus behavior
7087583 i think weve made huge strides in calming the place
7087584 as changes in habitat become more severe and seasonal rates of change more rapid catastrophic mortality events that have yet to be realized on a large scale are expected to occur
7087585 the impact of global warming is brutal and tragic for polar bears
7087586 the only way to limit the number of bears that will drown and starve is to reduce greenhouse gas pollution immediately but we must act immediately
7087587 i came in and there were police officers outside they handed me a leaflet saying dont be worried theyre just looking into the neighbourhood there have been three terror arrests
7087588 it was quite hard to see which houses because there were crowds of people outside and two police cars and a van its really worrying that its so close you cant believe its actually happening on your street in your community
7087589 you dont expect it on your doorstep but thats life it could happen anywhere
7087590 they were a law abiding family theyve never been in any trouble whatsoever theyre normal everyday lads
7087591 whatever the letter said it was troubling enough that people drove themselves to the hospital
7087592 against the insidious wiles of foreign influence a free people ought to be constantly awake
7087593 its a tremendous amount of money out of peoples pockets
7087594 people can cut back on heating to some extent if it gets too expensive but theres obviously a floor beyond which they cant go to keep themselves in their homes without freezing
7087595 maybe the people who are very very wealthy wont bat an eyelash but for the regular people who are working from paycheck to paycheck and week to week and dont have anything in the bank account this is devastating
7087596 people ask me how do you get by i sacrifice a lot of stuff
7087597 i dont drink i dont smoke i dont go out
7087598 any type of increase in cost especially of this magnitude is just going to make life so precarious so difficult perhaps even unlivable unless we can subsidize those households so that they can make it
7087599 i cant even think about the next two winters its obviously a horror show in the making
7087600 the good news is that people are talking about it now when the weather is 85 degrees
7087601 we decided to lift some of the strict criteria that weve placed on our vendors on our other two sites
7087602 while we deeply care about those with chemical sensitivities and those looking for 100 pure products we realize that there are companies making exquisite products with some naturally derived ingredients some of these ingredients deliver benefits that 100 ingredients cannot match so this site will be quite appreciated by those that are looking for safer alternatives to mainstream beauty products plus want the choice of all natural products the anb mall is a place to come for a wide selection of safe beauty products
7087603 i just want to thank the staff from soap wire for publishing our press release your website has been a great source of news and resources for us you do a great job supporting natural and organic beauty products your posting has increased our website traffic 10 fold
7087604 we are very happy with the results of our soapwire press release sheer miracle received quite a bit of exposure as a result several magazines and even television producers have contacted us with interest in our product line we got a great product review in vision magazine a number of potential wholesale clients who read our press release have contacted us for information and samples we feel the press release was well worth the investment and are very happy with our roi thanks
7087605 your newswire rocks the last newswire i did on another press site didnt do anything for me yours jumped my site up on google overnight
7087606 having been in the handcrafted industry for over 15 years ive found the soap wire to be not only a dedicated source for valuable and consistent information but also as an advertising tool that landed us an article in the
7087607 caches of supplies that could be used by violent demonstrators
7087608 football baseball motorcycle and bicycle helmets are all used by violent protesters
7087609 bicycles are used to blockade sidewalks streets and can be used to slow down responding emergency vehicles
7087610 while most of the activity will be peaceful and take place in the city of denver past practices of demonstrators show that they will use outlying buildings homes camping facilities secluded woods and farm field to store their supplies
7087611 information concerning the camping boarding or housing of potential violent protesters that have rented campaign spaces rented farms or land for the time period around the dnc
7087612 frequently used by violent protester sic to plan direct actions against conventioneers
7087613 to find so many polar bears at sea at one time is extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to melt many more bears may be out there facing similar risk
7087614 as climate change continues to dramatically disrupt the arctic polar bears and their cubs are being forced to swim longer distances to find food and habitat
7087615 while these bears are swimming around in an ice free coastal arctic ocean the only thing the state of alaska is doing is suing the federal government trying to overturn the listing of polar bears
7087616 the bottom line here is that polar bears need sea ice sea ice is decaying and the bears are in very serious trouble for any people who are still non believers in global warming and the impacts it is having in the arctic this should answer their doubts once and for all
7087617 the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
7087618 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
7087619 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
7087620 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
7087621 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed all transfer of data to the external contractor has been suspended pending investigation
7087622 the public will be losing confidence in jacqui smith who has failed yet again to tighten security despite a series of data mishandling fiascos
7087623 the information commissioner is being consulted about the prospect of some of these criminals asking to be re housed and suing the government under the data protection act because their privacy has been breached
7087624 the british taxpayer will be absolutely outraged if they are made to pick up the bill for compensation to serious criminals she must tell us now what advice the information commissioner is giving her on this farcical situation
7087625 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses more personal information has been reported lost it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
7087626 i was looking at the sturgis schedule and noticed that you had a beauty pageant so i encouraged cindy to compete i told her that with a little luck she could be the only woman to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip
7087627 we have a lot of work to do its a very hard struggle particularly given the situation on the iraq pakistan border
7087628 i am learning to get online myself and i will have that down fairly soon getting on myself i dont expect to be a great communicator i dont expect to set up my own blog but i am becoming computer literate to the point where i can get the information that i need

7087638 un estiramiento brusco en el partido de cuartos despu s de esperar se ha confirmado una rotura fibrilar del adductor largo de la pierna derecha y del m sculo gracilis lesi n que le impide competir y que necesita dos o tres semanas de recuperaci n
7087639 algo que en un primer momento le dej abatido pero ahora se ha dado cuenta de que puede ayudar al equipo desde el banquillo con otros detalles
7087640 hay que darle tiempo al tiempo todav a no s lo que har pero al europeo de polonia igual voy como comentarista de televisi n
7087641 his letters are weighty and forceful but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing
7087642 we may have an idea what it would have meant
7087643 rudy giuliani theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11 theres nothing else
7087644 the root city band is a three piece outfit based in minneapolis that is well known for tight musicianship and a knack to incorporate elements of rock soul and funk into their own original jams
7087645 muchos de nosotros ciertamente estamos sufriendo de fatiga a causa de fay pero debemos mantenernos enfocados
7087646 would be honored to run with or against john mccain
7087647 rudy giuliani today has taken the politics of fear to a new low and i believe americans are ready to reject those kind of politics america s mayor should know that when it comes to 9 11 and fighting terrorists america is united
7087648 the irony is rudy giuliani probably the most underqualified man since george bush to seek the presidency is here talking about any of the people here
7087649 rudy giuliani i mean think about it rudy giuliani theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11 theres nothing else
7087650 obamas in much better shape because he seems to have very good standing in the places that john kerry won and very good opportunities in a number of other states that look like they could go to the democrats
7087651 mccains fundamental problem is theres only one way home for him replicate the bush electoral victory state by state
7087652 the fundamental truth remains that this race is extremely tight mccain is in strong position in ohio and florida two states that have been critical for republican victories and hes better positioned today in michigan than the president was in either 2000 or 2004
7087653 you never really expect it to be someone that youre close to but after a few minutes when it started to sink in i was very proud
7087654 its always difficult when a friend dies however theres a time for mourning and theres a time for standing up and carrying on
7087655 he told me maccready im going to save this beer for when you get back
7087656 its tough you talk to everybody talk to the family just make sure that everybody that needs to talk to somebody can talk to somebody and then soldier on
7087657 biden allies note that despite his long service in washington he is at his core an outsider inside the beltway while that may well be true the optics for obama arent great he cant change the fact that in picking biden he would be going with someone who has spent nearly his entire adult life not only in politics but as a member of the worlds greatest deliberative body
7087658 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance

7087670 very impressed by senator obamas selection of senator joe biden to be his running mate
7087671 over his decades of public service and accomplishment senator joe biden has demonstrated a commitment to improving the lives of all americans
7087672 as our vice presidential nominee he will bring his middle class values the values he grew up with the values of his constituents and the values of the american people to this campaign and to put our country back on track
7087673 one of the defining dynamics of 2008 has been the emerging wave of new young voters getting involved and storming the gates of the traditional political establishment
7087674 tal vez haya tiempos mejores pero ste es el nuestro
7087675 no ha habido hasta ahora peor cr tico de la falta de experiencia de barack obama que el propio joe biden
7087676 biden ha denunciado el escaso juicio pol tico de obama en pol tica exterior y ha criticado personalmente lo que los estadounidenses est n empezando a constatar que barack obama no est listo para ser presidente
7087677 this is the third time weve come here to get medicine and im very happy to come here
7087678 we handed out a lot of vitamin syrup tylenol motrin mostly aches and pains type stuff
7087679 we really dont have anything to give treatment in depth like blood pressure medicine if we did it would only be a one month supply
7087680 we have federer nadal in tennis we have the best cyclists rinaldinho is here in football we want these guys in the game were not saying its an entire major league team but we want the top athletes here at the olympics
7087681 walter johnson is the greatest pitcher to ever play the game of baseball
7087682 it was a brief conversation theyve known each other for years
7087683 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7087684 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7087685 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7087686 if i am president advancing the cause of life will not be above my pay grade
7087687 i would not appoint anyone who did not understand that section 5 of the 14th amendment and the liberty clause provided a right to privacy which means they would support roe v wade
7087688 the immediate death toll from the cyanide release was in excess of 2 000 people

7087698 es la explicaci n amplia y detenida de los fundamentos de nuestra fe para que el cristiano comprenda y oriente su vida de acuerdo con eso
7087699 debe estar tranquilo porque el s tiene todas las de ganar
7087700 no tiene el aparato publicitario del gobierno y la euforia del presidente
7087701 es un escenario complejo para el presidente porque al hacer alg n comentario que la descalifique o la ofenda puede herir la sensibilidad de los creyentes
7087702 los grupos que se oponen a la constituci n lo hacen porque esta es mala o porque temen perder sus privilegios
7087703 gravar arrendar o ejercer cualquier otro acto de disposici n sobre tierras comunales
7087704 el ejecutivo ha sobrepasado la voluntad del congreso de las comunidades nativas y los instrumentos supranacionales
7087705 la manera correcta hubiese sido el di logo hacer sesiones descentralizadas con las organizaciones ind genas antes de aprobar los decretos nosotros no avalamos definitivamente la protesta pero esto ha sido causado por el ejecutivo
7087706 aqu se est hablando de especialidad cultural acaso los nativos son menores de edad lo que pretende esta ley es un cambio revolucionario para sacarlos de la pobreza las cosas tienen que aplicarse de manera uniforme porque eso es el estado de derecho
7087707 lo nico que va a conseguir el gobierno es generar un malestar en el pa s y eso es seguir provocando a los ind genas eso se llama terrorismo de estado
7087708 nuestro pa s es pluricultural todos los programas pol ticos se implementan como si el per fuera plano hay que promover un desarrollo desde lo que somos el elemento cultural debe ser considerado como base para nuestro desarrollo
7087709 si observa la ley el gobierno no estar a respetando la democracia
7087710 el presidente tiene que pensar que la inversi n tan ajena a nuestra realidad y diversidad que promueve no necesariamente genera desarrollo
7087711 esto es una muestra de que los pueblos se unieron para hacer llegar su voz aqu no hay perdedores ni ganadores todos los peruanos hemos dado un gran paso que va a perdurar
7087712 no queremos ser una carga social sino solucionar los grandes problemas
7087713 la ausencia de procedimientos de consulta previa antes de emprender o autorizar actividades en tierras ind genas es una de las causas de conflicto socio ambiental
7087714 during the year the government did not take any measures to implement the 2001 vested property return act providing for property restitution to persons mostly hindus who had their property seized by the government after the 1965 india pakistan war
7087715 all citizens are equal before the law and are entailed to equal protection of law

7087721 gerhard mario theissen ist nach dem qualifying zu dir und sebastian gekommen und hat euch gratuliert was hat er denn gesagt
7087722 wir sind nat rlich aus alten tagen gute freunde da gratuliert man sich wenn es einmal gut l uft nat rlich machen wir das umgekehrt genauso bei uns ist es heute gut gelaufen daher hat sich mario hierher bewegt
7087723 sebastian war in q1 zweiter in q2 erster und in q3 dann sechster
7087724 alle fahrer sind zum ersten mal hier daher hat er von den streckenkenntnissen keinen nachteil er hat von der ersten minute an diesem wochenende einen sehr guten job gemacht eigentlich beide fahrer waren gut unterwegs
7087725 wir haben auch gestern schon gesehen dass wir von der fahrzeugabstimmung her gut zurechtkommen wir haben gestern nachmittag viel f r das rennen probiert und sind mit einem schweren auto gefahren daher waren wir nicht ganz vorne heute war es ein perfekter tag auch wenn ich sagen muss nach dem zweiten lauf als ich gesehen habe dass sebastian schnellster war habe ich f r einen moment ein bisschen getr umt aber die realit t ist dann ganz schnell wieder gekommen
7087726 getr umt von der pole position oder von den top 3
7087727 ich habe gesehen dass die ferraris nicht wissen ob sie harte oder weiche reifen fahren sollen denn die sind st ndig mit einem anderen reifen drau en gewesen da hat man gesehen dass sie ein bisschen in schwierigkeiten stecken daher habe ich geglaubt dass wir das vielleicht f r uns ein bisschen nutzen k nnen am schluss hatte aber jeder seine sache im griff
7087728 ich glaube wenn sebastian die letzte runde gut gefahren w re h tte er sicherlich kovalainen noch abfangen k nnen ein f nfter platz w re das beste gewesen was drin gewesen w re aber mit dem sechsten sind wir superzufrieden ein traum ist dass wir beide autos in den top 10 haben das ist das beste ergebnis das wir bis jetzt erzielt haben damit kann man sich sehen lassen
7087729 sam is that a police car do you have a police car wheres the fire truck can you find the fire truck what color is the fire truck
7087730 we dont want him to be add just let him play
7087731 the sky is blue do you see the blue sky what color is the sky
7087732 menos ambicioso y m s retr grado que sus dirigentes en madrid
7087733 i dnt no who the fuk u think u dealin wit u will neva be heard from one phone call is all i gotta make no try me sho me
7087734 wenn dieser entwickler hinunter sagt und beschmutzt noch eine zeit werde ich ihn in brand setzen
7087735 if this developer says down and dirty one more time im going to set him on fire
7087736 i think the downward spiral of house prices could be a very serious problem to the economy there is no evidence that is going to stop
7087737 it is not clear where the lift will come from
7087738 what is daunting now is that weve got a lot to go we now have a weak consumer and after some amount of time well have a weak business sector and a major global slowdown in growth all of this will reverberate back into the economy
7087739 and the big wild card is how long does it take to deleverage consolidate squeeze down costs and then have some liveliness in the business of financial service
7087740 that process time wise along with financial problem could easily take a year
7087741 i think the most likely scenario is by early next year things start to work themselves out
7087742 i dont think were likely to get a very robust recovery but i dont think a more disastrous scenario is the most likely case either
7087743 i think six months from now we will start to see the light at the end of the tunnel of the housing crisis
7087744 at that point some of the uncertainty about how much home prices will fall will start to dissipate
7087745 that will open the door for the fed hiking rates
7087746 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7087747 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7087748 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7087749 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7087750 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7087751 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7087752 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7087753 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7087754 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7087755 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7087756 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7087757 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7087758 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7087759 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7087760 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7087761 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7087762 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7087763 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7087764 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7087765 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7087766 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7087767 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7087768 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7087769 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7087770 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7087771 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7087772 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7087773 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7087774 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7087775 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7087776 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7087777 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7087778 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7087779 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7087780 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7087781 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7087782 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7087783 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7087784 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7087785 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7087786 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7087787 you have witnessed that despite sanctions we not only moved forward in the nuclear issue but even launched a satellite carrier
7087788 the big powers should know that sanctions would just make the nation stronger and more decisive in reaching the peak of its technological goals
7087789 todo mundo precisa vender a arte para poder comprar a tinta
7087790 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7087791 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7087792 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7087793 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7087794 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7087795 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7087796 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7087797 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7087798 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7087799 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7087800 its basking in the glow of the improving economic situation in the region
7087801 watch your back rachel kat and darnell are the ones to watch
7087802 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7087803 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7087804 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7087805 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7087806 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7087807 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7087808 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7087809 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7087810 a senior obama adviser speaking on condition of anonymity said his boss has expressed impatience with what he calls a
7087811 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7087812 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7087813 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7087814 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7087815 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7087816 lord please give me some patience and i mean now
7087817 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7087818 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7087819 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7087820 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7087821 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7087822 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7087823 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7087824 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7087825 who are open to doing something on the production side
7087826 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7087827 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7087828 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7087829 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7087830 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7087831 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7087832 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

7087859 obama ainda n o estava pronto para a presid ncia
7087860 a escolha de biden enfatiza certas fragilidades que a campanha de obama visa a corrigir num momento em que as pesquisas mostram que sua competi o com o senador republicano john mccain se torna mais disputada
7087861 para uma campanha que se orgulha de sua disciplina em termos de comunica o a op o por biden incorpora equipe um forte elemento fuerte de incerteza

7087878 were in iraq as a result of a democracy asking for us to come in there
7087879 im sure the tragedy of this circumstance will hit all of those communities
7087880 he was very well qualified hed flown that plane for hundreds of hours hed flown this route many times
7087881 were in iraq as a result of a democracy asking for us to come in there
7087882 they quarrelled over some issue and mishra was beaten up his family called the police realising the situation was going out of control
7087883 around 11 30 pm the boys made called mishra on mobile phone and asked him to come out he left the house without informing anyone

7087887 well decide whether to support zardari in our meeting tomorrow sunday
7087888 they ppp should have taken the coalition partners into confidence
7087889 the presidents office is not a joke its very important for states and to avoid further destabilisation in the country ppp has nominated zardari for the post
7087890 will stay within the coalition and will not destabilise the system which has started gaining roots in the country

7087893 you could take all 100 senators democrats and republicans and i think they would all agree that the most knowledgeable person on foreign affairs is joe biden
7087894 quite a few occasions mostly telling him who i didnt want
7087895 absent some profound political announcement i cant imagine there being an overwhelming even significant support for the presidents position
7087896 it has taken nine bloody and difficult months but the deployment of 30 000 additional u s troops appears at last to have brought not just a lull in the sectarian fighting in iraq but the first tangible steps toward genuine political reconciliation
7087897 how can they be opening firehouses in baghdad and closing them in boise
7087898 burning man is not a select club or a clique or a closed subculture
7087899 it is a kind of tapestry an ever widening network of actions and relationships extending far beyond the place called black rock city as a result many of us have gained a way of looking at life that is similar
7087900 since it was smaller than burning man you get to know fewer people better
7087901 it has the same vibe as far as the dancing and the music and less dramatic huge art
7087902 i cry when i finally arrive on the playa to meet my chosen family most of whom i havent seen for an entire year

7087919 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today
7087920 in that building existed little more than a bunch of
7087921 im just a pissed off civil rights activist who has to laugh when those who had directly discriminated against me saw offices i might otherwise be working in reduced to rubble there was no significant loss of life in those towers
7087922 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
7087923 there was no significant loss of life in those towers
7087924 so folks it has been quite awhile since a proper update on whats going on weve been mostly taking summer off which is why theres been little to report but we are revving into full gear for the fall so its time to let you in on whats up our collective sleeves
7087925 first up to deck is our upcoming european tour with our trusted and talented labelmates torche
7087926 coinciding with that tour will be some new merch goodies can anyone say limited edition split 10
7087927 also as previously announced we will have copies of the fire in our throats on double lp in a repressed edition courtesy of our friends at viva hate records
7087928 on return from the land across the pond there is a tour in the works for the eastern coats of this united states of a
7087929 when i said that we took the summer off well i kind of lied we did get together to work on new material including a song called inch above sand which we recorded for an upcoming split 7
7087930 actually the song already made its live debut in chicago a couple of weeks ago at our last minute show at the subterranean
7087931 but i would be remiss if i were to tell you that this was the only video recording going on in our summer as we spent a couple of days with our buddy kenneth in sunny los angeles shooting the music video for lost in the headlights
7087932 what else besides finishing the writing for our next full length expect it sometime in 09 were also working on a collaborative split 7
7087933 the pool we measured there was about 17 meters which isnt too bad
7087934 it was sort of in the shape of the red cross sign
7087935 one thing i kept saying to myself strangely was this doesnt define me
7087936 its like the art of war the battle is won before youve begun and for me its sort of disappointing to get up on the blocks knowing im really not ready all these guys have been swimming for 10 years or more at the same time you have to just take it like a man
7087937 there was no significant loss of life in those towers not a one
7087938 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today
7087939 in that building existed little more than a bunch of
7087940 im just a pissed off civil rights activist who has to laugh when those who had directly discriminated against me saw offices i might otherwise be working in reduced to rubble there was no significant loss of life in those towers
7087941 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
7087942 there was no significant loss of life in those towers
7087943 at least we wouldnt have been able to come back to the u s there would be suspensions
7087944 they wont do anything to them its a double standard
7087945 nos ha costado mucho llegar hasta aqu y nos lo merecemos somos campeonas ol mpicas
7087946 el nico momento en que hemos estados solas en el vestuario ha sido indescriptible no tengo palabras para expresar todo el sentimiento que tengo en estos momentos
7087947 hemos pasado por situaciones muy dif ciles y hemos sabido salir adelante para llegar a lo m s alto
7087948 la fortaleza de este grupo es lo que nos ha hecho llegar hasta aqu y que hoy podamos celebrar que somos campeonas ol mpicas
7087949 la verdad es que no quer amos bajarnos del podio por m seguir a all toda la noche y ma ana tambi n casi no nos lo cre amos y hab a que saborear el momento es fant stico
7087950 los kazakos compraron a los jueces a m me ofrecieron dinero
7087951 ellos consintieron que la federaci n tomara una decisi n sin gran presi n
7087952 la cuarta posici n no es lo que yo estaba buscando pero no es el fin del mundo he bloqueado las ruedas en varios puntos durante la q3 y he perdido un tiempo muy valioso en este circuito un peque o error es muy costoso
7087953 tenemos un buen coche y eso debe pesar en la carrera
7087954 volvemos a jugar en nuestro estadio la primera vez esta temporada ante nuestra afici n y tenemos la posibilidad de ganar un t tulo hemos analizado muy bien el partido de ida donde cometimos errores que dieron m s vida al valencia y es lo que tenemos que intentar cambiar
7087955 es una prueba muy importante para el equipo con un resultado parecido al de champions del a o pasado ante el roma venimos con una derrota corta pero posible de remontar los peque os detalles ser n importantes hay que tener paciencia para no cometer errores
7087956 mandamos a tres jugadores a los juegos y dos vienen con medalla estamos muy orgullosos de ellos
7087957 la plantilla se puede cerrar el ltimo d a de este mes
7087958 estamos trabajando con una plantilla formada nueva el a o pasado que tiene muchos a os por delante se ha intentado traer jugadores pero no ha podido ser eso no quita la calidad que demostramos el a o pasado sobre todo en liga confiamos plenamente en el equipo y si no viene nadie no pasar a absolutamente nada
7087959 hay algunas cuestiones t cnicas que a n tenemos que perfeccionar
7087960 fuimos lo m s profesionales que pudimos durante ese mes
7087961 fue una situaci n muy dura y adem s injusta en la medida en que ten an que estar aqu los dos barcos los actuales criterios de clasificaci n ol mpica est n machacando a europa
7087962 cal opt por ir a salamanca en busca de un entreno con m s calor ya que su prueba es m s larga puesto que supera los 3 minutos y medio mientras que la nuestra es de 1 30 escasos
7087963 cuando p rez de obanos era alcalde de li dena desde 1991 hasta el 2003 me declar hijo ilustre e inaugur un gimnasio con mi hombre
7087964 deb a quedarse hasta el 10 de setiembre para celebrar conmigo mi cumplea os
7087965 este partido est dedicado a las v ctimas de la agresi n georgiana estoy aqu para apoyar a mi pueblo a mis hermanos que sobrevivieron tiempos muy duros espero que la guerra nunca m s vuelva a esta sufrida tierra
7087966 es la mejor selecci n de los ltimos veinticinco o treinta a os
7087967 no se puede hacer m s lo han dado todo
7087968 es un grupo tremendo de jugadores y personas que lo ha dado todo y no se puede hacer m s
7087969 no hemos ganado y no se puede hacer m s ya lo dije despu s de la semifinal este es un grupo tremendo de jugadores y de personas lo han dado todo un equipo que ha jugado tan ofensivo como espa a ha tenido dos partidos con resultados de f tbol y eso no es normal en hockey
7087970 es una l stima porque a espa a le gusta atacar
7087971 ellos saben defender son los mejores del mundo haci ndolo en un campo que hubiera estado r pido habr a sido m s f cil no es una excusa hemos puesto raza hemos dado todo lo que se puede hemos jugado en la final yendo a saco no se puede pedir m s
7087972 nunca hab a ganado una plata y no sab a que ganar una plata dol a tanto en los bronces se gana y las platas se pierde
7087973 hace dos a os cuando en el mundial ganaron el bronce se dijeron que iban a por el oro y ha faltado muy poco
7087974 tal y como va el hockey con kamikaces en los penaltis que se permiten entradas y gente que se agarra de la camiseta cosas que no ayudan en el deporte eso favorece el juego defensivo
7087975 pero se juega con las normas que hay y no las van a cambiar porque lo pida espa a si queremos ganar tenemos que mejorar algunas cosas que nos quedan que son pocas
7087976 he tenido una relaci n fort sima con el presidente un se or mayor con mucha sabidur a que me ha apoyado en todo me ha dado confiada
7087977 pero en espa a la norma es que si cambia el presidente y no tienes el apoyo total del nuevo es dif cil trabajar tengo que esperar con este equipo no he llegado a ning n punto de saturaci n pero conozco la situaci n en espa a s lo trabajo donde la gente realmente me quiere
7087978 es un lanzador muy dif cil de hacerle da o porque sabe colocar muy bien la pelota con la recta a dentro y a fuera sin darle nada a los bateadores
7087979 pero creo que tuvimos las oportunidades claras de haber podido ganar el partido
7087980 todo el equipo respondi con un gran b isbol y en los momentos decisivos
7087981 como sucedi en la fase previa hicimos bien las cosas y controlamos al bateo explosivo de cuba
7087982 dependo demasiado de la suerte para conseguir un buen resultado
7087983 las opciones de finalizar entre los cinco primeros dependen exclusivamente de la suerte es lo nico que nos queda saliendo de tan atr s duod cimo
7087984 a lo largo del fin de semana no ha habido ning n accidente fuerte y esperemos que siga todo igual pero varios pilotos han estado cerca de rozar el muro y si eso pasa en carrera implicar necesariamente la aparici n en pista del coche de seguridad
7087985 hoy no hemos sido suficientemente r pidos tenemos que mejorar empezando por la carrera de ma ana otras veces hemos logrado entrar en la q3 por d cimas pero en esta ocasi n nos ha tocado a nosotros quedarnos fuera no se ha podido hacer m s
7087986 la de ma ana ser una carrera en la que estamos en manos del coche de seguridad y de que aparezca cuando ya hayamos repostado de lo contrario s lo podremos finalizar en octava o novena posici n algo que no da demasiadas satisfacciones
7087987 hoy hice tres intentos al l mite el mejor y el peor estuvieron separados por dos d cimas as que es evidente que ah est mi limite no puedo esperar un milagro para ganar un segundo de repente es una pena porque estamos corriendo en casa
7087988 s lo me he quedado fuera de la q3 en dos ocasiones una en australia y otra en valencia muy a mi pesar a ver si lo podemos remediar de alguna manera seguro que ma ana se mejorar n los tiempos vuelta a vuelta porque la pista estar en mejores condiciones luego vendr el baile de los repostajes y ah veremos que estrategia elegimos
7087989 tenemos m s flexibilidad creo que los neum ticos pueden aguantar a una sola parada
7087990 el viernes tuvimos bastante desgaste en los neum ticos porque la pista estaba muy limpia y actuaba como una lija pero creo que ma ana aguantar n en mejores condiciones porque habr m s goma en la pista
7087991 esta noche o ma ana por la ma ana tendremos todos los datos estamos simulando carreras para ver c mo obtendr amos mejores resultados con dos paradas resulta m s r pido pero la simulaci n no tiene en cuenta la posible aparici n del coche de seguridad en pista
7087992 quiz vayamos a elegir una estrategia a una sola parada y cruzando los dedos para que el coche de seguridad aparezca en el momento adecuado
7087993 oye qu b rbara te llevaste a todas pero con varios puntos as que no sabes qu contentos estamos todos y desde luego pues muy emocionados
7087994 le das una alegr a enorme a sinaloa en un momento que lo necesita mucho y de veras qu coraz n y qu coraje y qu gallard a tienes muchas felicidades
7087995 esto de la lesi n me imagino que fue un momento muy dif cil pero ya lo sacaste muy bien adelante
7087996 es muy bueno que haya alcanzado tal victoria porque eso le dar todav a mas fuerzas para llegar aqu y trabajar con mayor confianza en sus cualidades demostrar sus virtudes en un benfica cada vez mejor
7087997 el talento demostrado fue el mismo que en el pasado nos llev a traerlo para nuestro club
7087998 el benfica siente orgullo de tu medalla ol mpica se al del trabajo de la determinaci n y tambi n de xito en tu vida profesional
7087999 arshavin tiene mucho talento pero es dif cil decir que pueda triunfar en equipos como el valencia el barcelona porque en espa a hay que jugar siempre al cien por cien al haber m s equipos competitivos que en rusia
7088000 con el grupo que tenemos pocos fichajes hab a que hacer
7088001 teniendo el grupo que tenemos pocos fichajes hab a que hacer ha venido van der vaart que hace crecer mucho m s a esta plantilla por su enorme calidad es joven y tiene una ilusi n enorme por hacer las cosas bien y triunfar en el real madrid ha demostrado en muy poco tiempo lo que puede hacer
7088002 cada vez queda menos hay que disfrutar a n m s de cada momento de cada entrenamiento y cada partido
7088003 para mi jugar en este club y con esta camiseta es la mejor de las motivaciones la mayor ilusi n posible a lo que se suma que estoy muy contento con el grupo que se ha formado tenemos un a o con muchos objetivos por delante y para eso tenemos que estar muy unidos trabajar con mucha humildad y sacrificio
7088004 el partido de vuelta va a ser totalmente diferente traemos un resultado que no es malo porque siempre es importante marcar dos goles fuera de casa pero est claro que perder no gusta vamos a dar una nueva imagen y con nuestro p blico anim ndonos creo que es posible que consigamos alcanzar el primer t tulo de la temporada
7088005 el a o pasado disfrutamos mucho en el bernab u tanto aficionados como los propios jugadores tenemos la ilusi n de vivir un gran partido ante un gran rival como el valencia que tiene unos jugadores de enorme calidad ser un partido interesante complicado en el que deseamos mostrarnos superiores en nuestra casa
7088006 la copa de europa en este club siempre es algo importante y despu s de los ltimos a os en los que el nivel no ha sido el que esper bamos ojal podamos llegar lo m s lejos posible y conquistarla
7088007 it appears as though they had a platonic relationship that went back 20 years
7088008 its been really rewarding for us to see him outside like this and so healthy were proud of the progress hes made
7088009 when he first came to us he was very thin for his length
7088010 weve estimated hes about 3 or 4 years old but its hard to tell since his growth rate was altered by his limited environment and poor nutrition
7088011 he was so weak when he got here he could barely take two steps his muscles had atrophied pretty badly and he was frightened he had never been in sunshine and grass before and he just stayed huddled up against the wall behind the tortoise exhibit it took a good two months to get him strong enough that we felt he could go outside and walk through the grass like this
7088012 not only could such an animal pose a danger but most people dont have the resources to keep an animal like this the proper environment or food
7088013 they have no idea how to care for it the animal grows bigger than they expected and then ends up in a bad situation or let loose which poses other problems
7088014 we had to get two catch poles to put around the neck and tail
7088015 he was scared so it wasnt an easy task then we were able to get him in one of the cages in the animal control van and we brought him to the zoo
7088016 there really arent that many places around here to rehab an alligator
7088017 its like taking a person out of new york city and throwing him in the rain forest
7088018 he wouldnt know sources of food or how to survive
7088019 identifying the red flags of child neglect to facilitate evidence based focused responses
7088020 its warm its noisy and its pungent in there and the bats are flying all around you its really really cool
7088021 its something to do and its fun yeah its dirty work
7088022 on reaching dawar he surrounded the enemy in the mountain of zur where there was a famous hindu temple
7088023 other authorities say that kutaibah granted peace for 700 000 dirhams and entertainment for the moslems for three days the terms of surrender included also the houses of the idols and the fire temples the idols were thrown out plundered of their ornaments and burned although the persians used to say that among them was an idol with which whoever trifled would perish but when kutaibah set fire to it with his own hand many of them accepted islam
7088024 ambissa son of ishak az zabbi the governor of sindh in the khilafat of mutasim billah knocked down the upper part of the minaret of the temple and converted it into a prison
7088025 he then crossed the biyas and went towards multan muhammad destroyed the water course upon which the inhabitants oppressed with thirst surrendered at discretion
7088026 he then went to kandahar in boats and conquered it he destroyed the budd there and built in its place a mosque
7088027 the ultimate capture of beykund in ce 706 rewarded him with an incalculable booty even more than had hitherto fallen into the hands of the mahommedans by the conquest of the entire province of khorassaun and the unfortunate merchants of the town having been absent on a trading excursion while their country was assailed by the enemy and finding their habitations desolate on their return contributed further to enrich the invaders by the ransom which they paid for the recovery of their wives and children the ornaments alone of which these women had been plundered being melted down produced in gold one hundred and fifty thousand meskals of a dram and a half each among the articles of the booty is also described an image of gold of fifty thousand meskals of which the eyes were two pearls the exquisite beauty and magnitude of which excited the surprise and admiration of kateibah they were transmitted by him with a fifth of the spoil to hejauje together with a request that he might be permitted to distribute to the troops the arms which had been found in the place in great profusion
7088028 a breach was however at last effected in the walls of the city in ce 712 by the warlike machines of kateibah and some of the most daring of its defenders having fallen by the skill of his archers the besieged demanded a cessation of arms to the following day when they promised to capitulate the request was acceded to by kateibah and a treaty was the next day accordingly concluded between him and the prince of samarkand by which the latter engaged for the annual payment of ten millions of dirhems and a supply of three thousand slaves of whom it was particularly stipulated that none should either be in a state of infancy or ineffective from old age and debility he further contracted that the ministers of his religion should be expelled from their temples and their idols destroyed and burnt that kateibah should be allowed to establish a mosque in the place of the principal temple in which to discharge the duties of his faith to all this ghurek with whatever reluctance was compelled to subscribe and he proceeded accordingly to prepare for the reception of kateibah who at the period agreed upon entered samarkand with a retinue of four hundred persons selected from his own relatives and the principal commanders of his army he was met by ghurek with a respect bordering on adoration and conducted to the gate of the principal temple which he immediately entered and after performing two rekkauts of the ritual of his faith directed the images of pagan worship to be brought before him for the purpose of being committed to the flames from this some of the turks or tartars of samarkand endeavouring to dissuade him by a declaration that among the images there was one which if any person ventured to consume that person should certainly perish kateibah informed them that he should not shrink from the experiment and accordingly set fire to the whole collection with his own hands it was soon consumed to ashes and fifty thousand meskals of gold and silver collected from the nails which has been used in the workmanship of the images
7088029 he first took bamian which he probably reached by way of herat and then marched on balkh where he ruined the temple naushad on his way back from balkh he attacked kabul
7088030 starting from panjhir the place he is known to have visited he must have passed through the capital city of the hindu sahis to rob the sacred temple the reputed place of coronation of the sahi rulers of its sculptural wealth the exact details of the spoil collected from the kabul valley are lacking the tarikh i sistan records 50 idols of gold and silver and masudi mentions elephants the wonder excited in baghdad by elephants and pagan idols forwarded to the caliph by yaqub also speaks for their high value the best of our authorities put the date of this event in 257 870 71 tabari is more precise and says that the idols sent by yaq b reached baghdad in rabi al akhar 257 feb march 871 thus the date of the actual invasion may be placed at the end of ce 870
7088031 is one of the strongest frontier places of the musalm ns in it is the idol also known by the name of multan 13 the inhabitants of sind and india perform pilgrimages to it from the most distant places they carry money precious stones aloe wood and all sorts of perfumes there to fulfil their vows the greatest part of the revenue of the king of multan is derived from the rich presents brought to the idol when the unbelievers march against multan and the faithful do not feel themselves strong enough to oppose them they threaten to break their idol and their enemies immediately withdraw
7088032 a famous idol of theirs was that of multan dedicated to the sun and therefore called aditya
7088033 the city of taneshar is highly venerated by hindus the idol of that place is called cakrasvamin i e the owner of the cakra a weapon which we have already described it is of bronze and is nearly the size of a man it is now lying in the hippodrome in ghazna together with the lord of somanath which is a representation of the penis of mahadeva called linga
7088034 the linga he raised was the stone of somnath for soma means the moon and natha means master so that the whole word means master of the moon the image was destroyed by the prince mahmud may god be merciful to him ah 416 he ordered the upper part to be broken and the remainder to be transported to his residence ghaznin with all its coverings and trappings of gold jewels and embroidered garments part of it has been thrown into the hippodrome of the town together with the cakrasvamin an idol of bronze that had been brought from taneshar another part of the idol from somanath lies before the door of the mosque of ghaznin on which people rub their feet to clean them from dirt and wet
7088035 the amir marched out towards lamghan which is a city celebrated for its great strength and abounding wealth he conquered it and set fire to the places in its vicinity which were inhabited by infidels and demolishing idol temples he established islam in them he marched and captured other cities and killed the polluted wretches destroying the idolaters and gratifying the musalmans
7088036 after the sultan had purified hind from idolatry and raised mosques therein he determined to invade the capital of hind to punish those who kept idols and would not acknowledge the unity of god he marched with a large army in the year ah 404 ce 1013 during a dark night
7088037 a stone was found there in the temple of the great budda on which an inscription was written purporting that the temple had been founded fifty thousand years ago the sultan was surprised at the ignorance of these people because those who believe in the true faith represent that only seven thousand years have elapsed since the creation of the world and the signs of resurrection are even now approaching the sultan asked his wise men the meaning of this inscription and they all concurred in saying that it was false and no faith was to be put in the evidence of a stone
7088038 the chief of tanesar was obstinate in his infidelity and denial of god so the sultan marched against him with his valiant warriors for the purpose of planting the standards of isl m and extirpating idolatry the blood of the infidels flowed so copiously that the stream was discoloured not withstanding its purity and people were unable to drink it the victory was gained by gods grace who has established isl m for ever as the best of religions notwithstanding that idolaters revolt against it praise be to god the protector of the world for the honour he bestows upon isl m and musulm ns
7088039 the sultan then departed from the environs of the city in which was a temple of the hindus the name of this place was maharatul hind on both sides of the city there were a thousand houses to which idol temples were attached all strengthened from top to bottom by rivets of iron and all made of masonry work in the middle of the city there was a temple larger and firmer than the rest which can neither be described nor painted the sultan thus wrote respecting it if any should wish to construct a building equal to this he would not be able to do it without expending an hundred thousand thousand red dinars and it would occupy two hundred years even though the most experienced and able workmen were employed the sultan gave orders that all the temples should be burnt with naptha and fire and levelled with the ground
7088040 in kanauj there were nearly ten thousand temples which the idolaters falsely and absurdly represented to have been founded by their ancestors two or three hundred thousand years ago many of the inhabitants of the place fled and were scattered abroad like so many wretched widows and orphans from the fear which oppressed them in consequence of witnessing the fate of their deaf and dumb idols many of them thus effected their escape and those who did not fly were put to death
7088041 as power and the strength of a lion was bestowed upon ibrahim by the almighty he made over to him the well populated country of hindustan and gave him 40 000 valiant horsemen to take the country in which there were more than 1000 rais its length extends from lahore to the euphrates and its breadth from kashmir to the borders of sistan the army of the king destroyed at one time a thousand temples of idols which had each been built for more than a thousand years
7088042 the narrative of thy battles eclipses the stories of rustam and isfandiyar thou didst bring an army in one night from dhangan to jalandhar thou didst direct but one assault and by that alone brought destruction upon the country by the morning meal not one soldier not one brahman remained unkilled or uncaptured their beads were severed by the carriers of swords their houses were levelled with the ground with flaming fire thou has secured victory to the country and to religion for amongst the hindus this achievement will be remembered till the day of resurrection
7088043 thou didst depart with a thousand joyful anticipations on a holy expedition and didst return having achieved a thousand victories on this journey the army destroyed a thousand idol temples and thy elephants trampled over more than a hundred strongholds
7088044 muhammad built at nirun a mosque on the site of the temple of budh and ordered prayers to be proclaimed in the muhammadan fashion and appointed an imam
7088045 the forts of siwistan and s sam have been already taken the nephew of dahir his warriors and principal officers have been despatched and infidels converted to islam or destroyed instead of idol temples mosques and other places of worship have been built pulpits have been erected the khutba is read the call to prayers is raised so that devotions are performed at the stated hours the takbir and praise to the almighty god are offered every morning and evening
7088046 then all the great and principal inhabitants of the city assembled together and silver to the weight of sixty thousand dirams was distributed and every horseman got a share of four hundred dirams weight after this muhammad qasim said that some plan should be devised for realizing the money to be sent to the khalifa he was pondering over this when suddenly a brahman came and said heathenism is now at an end the temples are thrown down the world has received the light of islam and mosques are built instead of idol temples i have heard from the elders of multan that in ancient times there was a chief in this city whose name was jibawin and who was a descendant of the rai of kashmir he was a brahman and a monk he strictly followed his religion and always occupied his time in worshipping idols when his treasures exceeded all limits and computation he made a reservoir on the eastern side of multan which was hundred yards square in the middle of it he built a temple fifty yards square and he made a chamber in which he concealed forty copper jars each of which was filled with african gold dust a treasure of three hundred and thirty mans of gold was buried there over it there is an idol made of red gold and trees are planted round the reservoir it is related by historians on the authority of ali bin muhammad who had heard it from abu muhammad hindui that muhammad qasim arose and with his counsellors guards and attendants went to the temple he saw there an idol made of gold and its two eye were bright red rubies muhammad qasim ordered the idol to be taken up two hundred and thirty mans of gold were obtained and forty jars filled with gold dust this gold and the image were brought to treasury together with the gems and pearls and treasures which were obtained from the plunder of multan
7088047 the king has committed a very grievous mistake for he ought not on account of two slave girls to have destroyed a person who had taken captive a hundred thousand modest women like us and who instead of temples had erected mosques pulpits and minarets
7088048 it is related that amru lais conferred the governorship of zabulistan on fardaghan and sent him there at the head of four thousand horse
7088049 he destroyed the pillars and foundations of the idol temples and built in their stead mosques and colleges and the precepts of islam and the customs of the law were divulged and established
7088050 the government of the fort of kohram and of samana were made over by the sultan to kutbuddin he purged by his sword the land of hind from the filth of infidelity and vice and freed it from the thorn of god plurality and the impurity of idol worship and by his royal vigour and intrepidity left not one temple standing
7088051 kutbuddin marched from kohr m and when he arrived at mirat which is one of the celebrated forts of the country of hind for the strength of its foundations and superstructure and its ditch which was as broad as the ocean and fathomless an army joined him sent by the dependent chiefs of the country the fort was captured and a kotwal appointed to take up his station in the fort and all the idol temples were converted into mosques
7088052 he then marched and encamped under the fort of delhi the city and its vicinity were freed from idols and idols worship and in the sanctuaries of the images of the gods mosques were raised by the worshippers of one god kutbuddin built the jami masjid at delhi and adorned it with stones and gold obtained from the temples which had been demolished by elephants and covered it with inscriptions in toghra containing the divine commands
7088053 from that place asni the royal army proceeded towards benares which is the centre of the country of hind and here they destroyed nearly one thousand temples and raised mosques on their foundations and the knowledge of the law became promulgated and the foundations of religion were established
7088054 there was a certain tribe in the neighbourhood of kol which had occasioned much trouble three bastions were raised as high as heaven with their beads and their carcases became the food of beasts of prey
7088055 when kutbuddin beard of the sultans march from ghazna he was much rejoiced and advanced as far as h ns to meet him in the year ah 592 ce 1196 they marched towards thangar and the centre of idolatry and perdition became the abode of glory and splendour
7088056 in the year ah 599 ce 1202 kutbuddin proceeded to the investment of kalinjar on which expedition he was accompanied by the sahib kiran shamsuddin altamsh the temples were converted into mosques and abodes of goodness and the ejaculations of bead counters and voices of summoners to prayer ascended to high heaven and the very name of idolatry was annihilated
7088057 the sultan then returned from jalor to delhi and after his arrival not a vestige or name remained of idol temples which had raised their heads on high and the light of faith shone out from the darkness of infidelity and the moon of religion and the state became resplendent from the heaven of prosperity and glory
7088058 in the year 159 ce 776 al mahdi sent an army by sea under abdul malik bin shahabul musammai to india they proceeded on their way and at length disembarked at barada when they reached the place they laid siege to it the town was reduced to extremities and god prevailed over it in the same year the people were forbidden to worship the budd which the muhammadans burned
7088059 so he prayed to the almighty for aid and left ghazni on the 10th of shaban ah 414 with 30 000 horse besides volunteers and took the road to mult n
7088060 this temple of somnat was built upon fifty six pillars of teak wood covered with lead
7088061 the sultan then went towards dewal and darbela and jaisi the sultan raised a jami masjid at dewal on the spot where an idol temple stood
7088062 when sultan mahmud ascended the throne of sovereignty his illustrious deeds became manifest unto all mankind within the pale of islam when he converted so many thousands of idol temples into masjids he led an army to nahrwalah of gujarat and brought away manat the idol from somnath and had it broken into four parts one of which was cast before the entrance of the great masjid at ghaznin the second before the gateway of the sultans palace and the third and fourth were sent to makkah and madinah respectively
7088063 among the different coins struck in mahmuds reign one bore the following inscription the right hand of the empire mahmud sultan son of nasir uddin subuk tigin breaker of idols this coin appears to have been struck at lahore in the seventh year of his reign
7088064 after he returned to the capital in the year ah 632 ce 1234 the sultan led the hosts of islam toward malwah and took the fortress and town of bhilsan and demolished the idol temple which took three hundred years in building and which in altitude was about one hundred ells

7088066 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7088067 every time i talk to somebody about these shows coming up
7088068 theyre like i thought you guys were done but we always left that open its hard to explain our relationship to people because its kind of strange itsbecause we now live in separate cities but were also very comfortable with each other really these shows are us coming together for seans situation
7088069 i remember those being tumultuous times everybody was really tense
7088070 i was breaking up with some girl zak was watching his brother go to jail joe had something going on trying to find himself or something i think the record shows that
7088071 i say when hell freezes over then unfreezes then freezes over again
7088072 its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies
7088073 polygraph testing as currently used has extremely serious limitations in such screening applications if the intent is both to identify security risks and protect valued employees
7088074 right now the polygraph is the best tool they have at their hands but its not a tool thats without problems
7088075 why am i trying to live when im just living to die
7088076 according to the laws this is illegal but we wont outlaw sucking sweets
7088077 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7088078 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on the best type of spit for the task at hand
7088079 i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7088080 it depends on the evidence and circumstances so if something is brought to our attention it would be dealt with
7088081 but where do you stop for example if you start to try to stop everyone who is chewing gum
7088082 according to the laws this is illegal but we wont outlaw sucking sweets
7088083 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7088084 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on the best type of spit for the task at hand
7088085 i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7088086 it depends on the evidence and circumstances so if something is brought to our attention it would be dealt with
7088087 but where do you stop for example if you start to try to stop everyone who is chewing gum
7088088 we are very happy with felipes first place and he really drove very well
7088089 it was a shame for kimi who could have been a bit higher up the order even though fourth place cannot be considered a bad result all things considered a good day for the team even though we are well aware that its the race that counts tomorrow we can expect a sweaty afternoon and not just because of the heat we will have to pay great attention in managing all the possible scenarios that could occur the decisive factors will be the usual ones reliability first and foremost strategy performance and the work of the team and drivers on top of that there will be the unknowns that go with a track being raced on for the first time for our part we will do our utmost to try and bring home the best possible result in terms of the championship
7088090 its great to be on pole position especially after the great disappointment of budapest but im well aware the race is tomorrow and so there is still a long way to go my first run in q3 was very good and on the second i made a good improvement in the first sector and thats where pole came from today the track was still very slippery partly because of last nights rain after this mornings free practice i thought the harder tyres would be the most competitive in qualifying but at the start of the session i didnt feel as comfortable anymore and so we went for the softer compound the team did a great job in preparing for this event and i want to thank them for giving me such a strong car i hope we can have a good race tomorrow
7088091 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in q3 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly i still think i can be in the fight for the win especially if i manage to get a good start we have a good car which should be especially competitive in the race
7088092 a good qualifying session very close and made even more uncertain because of the weather a first and a fourth place is a good outcome even if it could have been better felipe did two great laps in q3 while kimi missed out by a whisker on being able to start from the clean side of the track in fact the start will be one of the decisive moments of the race tomorrow it will be important to try and pick up as many points as possible with both drivers we have a car that is competitive over a long run and we will try and exploit that as well as possible we must pay careful attention to managing all the possible scenarios that arise as on all street circuits the risk of a safety car period is always hanging over the race
7088093 i think one of the things wrong with my party is that we are too timid
7088094 as i have gone around the country the last couple of years if i had to do synthesize in one adjective what one national democrats think about the party the consensus on the word would be timidity
7088095 is america at this time in its history as focused as it is in its place in the world are they going to turn it over to a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate maybe
7088096 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7088097 whoever the next president is is going to have to know what he or she wants to do beyond a tactical move in other words there is a tactic and a strategy putting a cap on troops is a tactic cutting funding is a tactic making judgment about surging is a tactic but at the end of the day how are americas interests going to be preserved enhanced or diminished by whatever we leave behind
7088098 let me put it this way you didnt hear any one of them get in this debate at all till they announced for president i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7088099 and john says look if this is civil war we cant in good conscience keep our troops in the middle of it so examine johns rationale john says ok we got to go in there to solidify this give a chance for a political settlement so this civil war doesnt become a civil war but if it becomes a civil war we cant stay there johns said it would be immoral to keep american troops in the midst of that but when you ask john ok john you dont think its a civil war now but what happens if there is a full blown civil war and the iraqis are not helping us the government you say you cant keep the troops there ok john what do you do
7088100 one of the reasons that im running is i am not basing my confidence on being able to lead this country on foreign policy based upon merely an intuitive faith in my own judgment i am basing it on the things i recommended in bosnia kosovo iraq korea that have turned out to be true
7088101 mais enfin monsieur combien de temps la france va t elle continuer senfoncer avant de r agir

7088106 the governor has indicated that obama did not select him as a running mate
7088107 senator obama has made an outstanding selection in joe biden
7088108 strong leader fierce advocate and devoted family man with values rooted in the best of what american stands for
7088109 joe biden has been fighting his entire career for the change that senator obama champions
7088110 a sage voice on many of the toughest foreign policy issues of our time and has long been a strong advocate for protecting american families and making our communities safer
7088111 scoring goals is one thing that ive always wanted to do here
7088112 i did it when i was younger and i still feel i can score a lot of goals
7088113 i obviously need to be in that final third to get on the end of things and also to create things
7088114 i always try to get 10 a season from open play and if i am fit and playing week in week out then thats something i can achieve
7088115 in the last couple of years ive played in a few different positions because that was what the manager mark hughes wanted me to do
7088116 when i returned to blackburn i came into a club that was a very succesful
7088117 we were doing very well and the manager asked me to do a certain role which at the time i was very happy to do because it meant playing in the team
7088118 but i want to get on the ball and i want to be in that last third as much as possible
7088119 we went into saturdays game fully expecting to get something from fulham and blackburn is another opportunity to get something
7088120 im not bothered about what other people think its more about what i think what the staff think and what the players think
7088121 we know what we are capable of and if we achieve that well be okay
7088122 this week it has been important for us to look ahead not back
7088123 what im trying to drill home to the lads is that fulham is gone now but i think we have learned from that match
7088124 ive had one or two strikers over the last couple of weeks that have not quite come to fruition
7088125 after the reading game we have got 24 hours to get one in and a lot of things will go down to the last minute
7088126 its frustrating because weve been after a striker for a number of weeks everybody can see that and weve just got to be patient
7088127 i dont really look at the table until after 10 games but were not daft we know were the only team not to have scored a goal yet in the division and weve got to look at that and somehow generate more
7088128 its strange because he hadnt really been involved in pre season games and yet i started with him
7088129 it was the type of game where we needed to get about the opposition and get in their faces
7088130 we needed someone who could put themselves about and aaron did that
7088131 he surprised a lot of people i spoke to a lot of people after the game and they all said how well aaron did
7088132 every club in every league has got 24 or 25 players you can only play 11 people and the ones that played on saturday got the shirts
7088133 thats not to say it will be the same team every week its horses for courses and sometimes i base it on how they do in training
7088134 at the end of the day you need a big squad weve got a quality strikeforce and it gives us competition
7088135 we had that competition at manchester united it keeps you on your toes all the time thats how i want it
7088136 i want everyone vying for a place in the team and when they are not in the team i dont want them sulking i want them to work even harder thats what youve got to have at this level
7088137 i accept the comments but im not too sure if benni has said all of that ive not spoke to him yet
7088138 benni is a very very good player hes a player that will be staying at blackburn
7088139 hes still a little short of fitness and once he gets himself fit and sharp then theres no reason why benni cant play a major part for us this season
7088140 every week something negative seems to come out of ewood and its about time we spoke about something positive
7088141 you can see why sometimes premier league managers dont let their players go if they are going to start playing them for 90 minutes
7088142 its always a worry you wonder if youll come back with a half a team im disappointed with some of the managers because they played some of my players for 90 minutes as in andre ooijer roque santa cruz and steven reid
7088143 i was going along the right road in refereeing my promotions were pretty quick i was okay at my job and i did enjoy it
7088144 it s harder than people think you do respect the job they are doing
7088145 i started in the youth team then when iain dowie became manager in 2002 i was his assistant and i was caretaker manager for a couple of games but for the last four or five years ive been head of youth
7088146 there are five regulars in the first 11 who have come through the youth system good young players in their late teens and early 20s it makes you very proud when you see them come through and were fortunate that the management and staff give them a chance
7088147 having played there these people have an affinity with the club anyway so for young players to see players from the past still linked with burnley they relate to them
7088148 they can then get across to the youngsters how big the club is and how important it is to wear that shirt
7088149 i had a hernia problem when i arrived which i tried to play through
7088150 i was disappointed in that respect to miss wembley but i was pleased i played a part in scoring a few important goals
7088151 i was having a clear out at home and came across some old videos that shows how long ago it is because they didn t have dvds and that game is on an old match of the day tape
7088152 ive been getting into astronomy so i installed a skylight the people who live above me are furious
7088153 its a small world but i wouldnt want to paint it
7088154 curiosity killed the cat but for a while i was a suspect
7088155 i went to a store that had a sign that said
7088156 if its a penny for your thoughts and you put your two cents in someones making a penny
7088157 i finally got around to reading the dictionary turns out the zebra did it
7088158 oh we were wrong theres actually x thousand more ballots than we expected left to count based on what came in via the mail system
7088159 he was detained because he was believed to be a security risk
7088160 he was released when after review he was determined not to pose a threat
7088161 we will be seeking more specific information about why he was picked up and held and about his experience during his incarceration
7088162 but then it made a turn as if the wing dropped abruptly
7088163 we were still very low very close to the ground
7088164 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7088165 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7088166 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7088167 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7088168 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7088169 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7088170 its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies
7088171 polygraph testing as currently used has extremely serious limitations in such screening applications if the intent is both to identify security risks and protect valued employees
7088172 right now the polygraph is the best tool they have at their hands but its not a tool thats without problems
7088173 georgias smaller army was hardly a challenge to the russians
7088174 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7088175 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7088176 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7088177 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
7088178 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7088179 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7088180 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7088181 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
7088182 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7088183 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7088184 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7088185 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7088186 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7088187 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7088188 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7088189 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7088190 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7088191 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7088192 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7088193 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7088194 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7088195 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7088196 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7088197 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7088198 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7088199 we still live in the country that was built by ivan the terrible
7088200 people like putin they have no other idea of how to rule
7088201 what russia does now it cannot be analyzed with modern political logic it is obsolete if modern countries like the u s declare war they have more or less rational reasons even if they are mistaken
7088202 you shouldnt expect logic from a kgb lieutenant colonel anyway you shouldnt expect modern political thinking
7088203 russia is a big and capable country which will not let the west dictate the conditions
7088204 in any situation russia is going to act as it sees fit
7088205 russia has never been conquered not in 1 000 years though many tried
7088206 its because its in our genes not to allow anyone to dictate the conditions how to act where to act
7088207 theyve realized that if russia merely plays the role the west has made for it we would quickly become a country that protects the pipeline sending gas and oil from western siberia
7088208 it is too early to bury russia as a great power
7088209 what makes the situation even more difficult is that all these small nations which existed between russia and the heart of europe they have rushed to join europe
7088210 they wanted provocation at sea but they wont get it
7088211 no matter what happens we have already achieved our goal by proving that ordinary citizens with ordinary means can mobilise a defence of human rights for palestinians
7088212 we want people to see the palestinian problem as one of human rights not feeding them rice
7088213 today the iranian nation has obtained the technology to produce different kinds of satellites and with gods help it will launch its first telecommunications satellite into space
7088214 our nation has a modern missile that can launch the second stage missile 250 km 150 miles into space the second stage is a smaller missile carrying the satellite which has very complex technical equipment
7088215 amid the controversies of the ministerial hierarchy the cpn uml will stay out of the government
7088216 we have not said we wont accept cpn uml leader in the second position in the protocol ranking we are ready to show flexibility regarding this
7088217 you see tears theyre tears of happiness though we came a long way this tournament
7088218 georgia incrementar ahora sus esfuerzos por entrar en la otan rusia misma acaba de demostrar con toda claridad para qu necesita georgia dar este paso
7088219 lo que ocurre en georgia lo que hacen all las tropas rusas que destruyen las infraestructuras tanto militares como civiles viola todas las normas de los acuerdos internacionales y por tanto la presencia de las tropas rusas en georgia es ilegal
7088220 c mo se las puede llamar fuerzas de pacificaci n cuando son parte del conflicto
7088221 that depends on how big fannie and freddie blow up
7088222 some hit is going to come from existing preferred shareholders
7088223 theres not protection for shareholders of common or preferred shares
7088224 while some companies will probably have some writedowns i dont think theres a widespread effect on the whole industry
7088225 last week red hat detected an intrusion on certain of its computer systems and took immediate action
7088226 while the investigation into the intrusion is ongoing our initial focus was to review and test the distribution channel we use with our customers
7088227 an intruder was able to sign a small number of openssh packages relating only to red hat enterprise linux 4 i386 and x86 64 architectures only and red hat enterprise linux 5 x86 64 architecture only
7088228 as a precautionary measure we are releasing an updated version of these packages and have published a list of the tampered packages and how to detect them here
7088229 last week we discovered that some fedora servers were illegally accessed the intrusion into the servers was quickly discovered and the servers were taken offline
7088230 security specialists and administrators have been working since then to analyze the intrusion and the extent of the compromise as well as reinstall fedora systems
7088231 based on our review to date the passphrase was not used during the time of the intrusion on the system and the passphrase is not stored on any of the fedora servers
7088232 the next shock is going to be bigger and bigger still
7088233 the shocks keep getting bigger because we keep propping things up and bailing everyone out
7088234 guys were making too many mistakes here in the u k
7088235 oh my god were going to go down and if we go down the whole system goes down
7088236 okay got to print some more money got to save the day
7088237 you know others cant do this but its alright for us
7088238 this he conservative benjamin thompson claimed would feed sixty four people at a cost of a farthing a meal
7088239 no empire building no foreign wars cut taxes and spending etc
7088240 there is no shame in taking advantage of a fool
7088241 effectively all other paye taxpayers were subsidising leveraged investment in a non productive investment funded by foreign debt then if property investors were careful they could crystallise gains without paying a capital gains tax all they had to do was cross their fingers behind their back and tell inland revenue they had no intention of trading the property for profit im still amazed this has been allowed to endure there is no sense of anger yet from paye investors who are subsidising speculative property investing yet it continues the department of the prime minister and cabinet wrote a report on house prices and affordability in march it showed landlord numbers rose more than 100 000 to 300 000 in the decade to 2006 the report estimates the 149 billion of rental property generates a tax benefit of at least 700 million for property investors with the potential for up to 1 8b of tax benefits the reserve bank has asked the politicians to consider ring fencing these investment property losses to remove some of the hot air pumping up the housing bubble but there isnt a politician addressing the issue seriously
7088242 but the danger is that if the ets passes with green support the main parties and the country will sit back and regard the job as done the greens rightly object that the scheme as it stands does not address the threat boldly enough that the cost is falling too much on consumers and not enough on polluters and that the agriculture and transport sectors are being protected from the schemes requirements for too long the fact is the dwindling band of dissenters notwithstanding that the pace of climate change is outstripping the human races response to it as a result we risk becoming like a rabbit trapped in a trucks headlight beam paralysed by our own inaction an online survey whose results were reported this week suggests as much the poll found that one in 10 new zealanders believe it is too late to do anything about climate change alarming news for anyone trying to spread the message that everyone can do their bit their pessimism is shared by experts the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change said a year ago that we had passed the point where catastrophic climate change was avoidable but that does not mean we cannot act to mitigate its effects for too long major party policies have focused on protecting our brand in international trade and minimising the effect on industry and agriculture on the grounds that it would cost us too much to do more but as the stern review and other research has starkly shown the cost of not doing enough is much higher the greens are right to continue acting as the nations conscience and holding out for meaningful change recycling soft drink bottles is not going to be enough

7088252 im playing with one of the great players in the world in henrik again tomorrow sunday so it should be great i knew i was playing ok and ive really enjoyed the course
7088253 that was pathetic just pathetic a load of old rubbish
7088254 its still looking good for me and if i can finish ahead of the guys i will probably take my chances but my confidence is not great at the moment
7088255 at least we wouldnt have been able to come back to the u s there would be suspensions
7088256 they wont do anything to them its a double standard
7088257 this has not been a policy priority for this country for the last 40 years
7088258 there was an underlying assumption that as soon as economic growth takes place this will vanish so lets focus on economic growth lets focus on getting rich
7088259 maybe we didnt treat it like a crisis earlier which we should have then we would have taken corrective steps much earlier than now and what were thinking of doing now we shouldve started 10 years back
7088260 its not nice to want to have an international role and then find that youre having to defend such an indefensible position

7088289 mi piace di pi giocare che allenare giocare grandi partite mi piace molto ed assolutamente il senso del nostro lavoro domani non giochiamo la finale di champions league ma la supercoppa una partita da giocare ho gi vinto in portogallo e in inghilterrra dove ne ho persa anche una ora spero di vincerne una anche in italia e domani avr questoccasione giusto che tanti tifosi non ci saranno domani perch parecchi saranno ancora in vacanza per mi aspetto lo stesso un bel pubblico ieri mi hanno detto che potrebbero essere quarantamila oggi mi hanno detto che potranno essere tra i quarantamila e i cinquantamila ovviamente san siro molto grande ma credo che latmosfera per giocare sar bella credo che arriveranno anche parecchi tifosi da roma e penso che sia una cosa interessante
7088290 la squadra sta molto bene in condizione per poter vincere
7088291 difficile paragonare squadre di periodi diversi il calcio cambia i giocatori cambiano non mi sembra positivo fare il pargone con una squadra che ha vinto tanti titoli importate quello che pensiamo io e la squadra lavoriamo insieme in un gruppo parliamo di idee e sensazioni e in questo momento le sensazioni di tutti sono molto positive i giocatori sono felici e vanno in campo con fiducia a tutti piacerebbe avere il gruppo al completo ma il giorno prima di una gara importante non voglio parlare dei giocartori squalificati o infortunati ho 20 giocatori da impiegare e conto molto su di loro avete la lista dei convocati per domani sono tutti in grado di giocare sono molto tranquillo nel calcio poi si pu vincere pareggiare o perdere ma dal mio punto di vista le sensazioni alla vigilia sono molto positive siamo pieni di fiducia
7088292 oggi possiamo fare questo discorso e sar sempre lo stesso quando d una lista di convocati che voi avrete in mano prima della conferenza stampa non ci sar mai in questo elenco un giocatore non in grado di scendere in campo
7088293 quando noi allenatori arriviamo in una squadra che ha lavorato tanti anni con un altro tecnico possiamo scegliere la continuit oppure impostare la squadra in maniera diversa sono arrivato allinter a giugno ma qualche mese prima dopo la gara di champions league contro il liverpool ho parlato col presidente e ho capito di poter essere lallenatore dellinter durante il periodo successivo ho visto la squadra giocare domenica dopo domenica e alla fine la mia idea stata quella di volere linter che pensasse in modo diverso questo per non facile dopo solo un mese di lavoro e non posso dire che questa sia la mia inter dobbiamo lavorare e migliorare gara dopo gara e allenamento e dopo allenamento una cosa positiva che tutti hanno accettato questo cambiamento in modo positivo e con molta voglia di fare non posso certo dire che una squadra gi daccordo con le mie idee dopo un mese di lavoro il calcio come costruire una casa bisogna costruirla fase dopo fase posso dire che linter una squadra solida che ha empatia funzionale ovviamente dobbiamo migliorare in tante cose ma credo che il gruppo sia in condizioni perfette per giocare una partita difficile contro una roma che lavora da pi anni con un grande allenatore la roma una squadra che ha una dinamica solida e gioca a memoria forse ancora non siamo in condizione di giocare una bella partita sicuramente possiamo giocare e vincere tutte le squadre inter compresa hanno dei difetti per me fondamentale se noi riusciamo a nasconderli non esiste un sistema tattico perfetto una squadra perfetta un giocatore perfetto o un allenatore perfetto anche noi abbiamo piccoli difetti e altre qualit la roma ha grandi qualit ma anche punti deboli come tutti come noi stessi sono una bella squadra ma noi speriamo di riuscire a scoprire i loro difetti
7088294 ndr sorride abbiamo gi due trofei la franz beckenbauer cup e leusebio cup due grandi nomi nel calcio mondiale scherzi a parte la supercoppa sempre la prima competizione ufficiale della stagione e si affrontano sempre due squadre che hanno terminato la stagione precedente con gioia e fiducia infatti entrambe hanno vinto in questo momento la supercoppa la competione pi importante della stagione perch la partita che giochiamo domani ed io domani non penso ne alla champions ne al campionato mi interessa solo la gara con la roma con tutto quello che abbiamo qualit emozione fiducia empatia insomma giocheremo con tutte le nostre qualit i tifosi probabilmente avranno in mente campionato e coppa come le competizioni pi importanti ma domani giochiamo la supercoppa e credo che anche loro debbano considerare adesso questa gara come la pi importante in assoluto abbiamo la fortuna e il privilegio di giocare in casa nostra credo che i nostri tifosi possano fare un p la differenza in posistivo come i tifosi della roma lavranno fatta in casa loro nella finale di tim cup se domani la gente nerazzurra pu far sentire forza ed emozioni per noi sar importante
7088295 il giorno prima di giocare la supercoppa devo dire che i miei venti convocati sono i giocatori pi forti del mondo non voglio pensare in altro modo non considero in questo momento i giocatori indisponibili non ho bisogno di loro quei venti sono perfetti per giocare domani e ancora meno penso ai giocatori che non sono dellinter in questo momento il mercato aperto fino al primo settembre come una porta di un saloon che si pu aprire in entrambe le direzioni in questo momento sono pi che soddisfatto dei giocatori che ho a disposizione
7088296 questi tre sono i giocatori che posso schierare come difensori centrali materazzi quasi pronto ma abbiamo deciso insieme di proteggere la situazione in vista del campionato e della coppa in modo che lui possa essere al cento per cento in quelle occasioni cordoba samuel e chivu non sono ancora pronti abbiamo tre giocatori a disposizione e sono quelli che hanno occupato quel ruolo nel pre campionato perci non abbiamo probelemi burdisso ha fatto molto bene rivas ha disputato due belle gara a di amsterdam cambiasso un giocatore molto intelligente che pu adattarsi ho queste tre possibilit per noi una situazione perfetta non mi piace avere troppi difensori tra il campo e la panchina questi tre sono pi che sufficienti poi con maicon maxwell e zanetti ho tre opzioni per le posizioni di esterni difensivi
7088297 questa la vita nel calcio chiss se fra quattro o cinque anni trover una squadra da allenare la vita
7088298 posso parlare di stankovic dal primo giorno che lho conosciuto e abbiamo parlato nel mio ufficio gli ho detto che sono un allenatore onesto il primo giorno arrivato con tanti dubbi perch cerano delle voci su di lui gli ho risposto che per me non importa quello che succede nel periodo di vacanza se lui lavora bene e ha motivazione lui lo ha fatto e in questo momento un giocatore a disposizione per domani
7088299 vediamo come ho gi detto la porta aperta in entrambe le direzioni ancora per una settimana in pre campionato abbiamo lavorato per giocare in due modi diversi se ci sono figo e mancini possiamo giocare con due ali altrimenti possiamo cambiare modulo ho una squadra con una cultura tattica un gruppo che lavora bene e pu giocare in modi diversi abbiamo tante opzioni non vivo in questo momento con lapprensione di sapere che fra una settimana chiude il mercato e di sapere se arriva questo o quello sono assolutamente soddisfatto della nostra situazione
7088300 totti un giocatore fantastico e tutti siamo daccordo ma loro lavorano da tanti anni insieme e sicuramente non un dramma per loro sapere se lui gioca o meno lanno scorso sono stati mesi senza totti si sono adattati e si sono giocati fino allultimo il campionato linter ha avuto sempre la loro pressione dietro e stiamo parlando di una roma senza totti che ha fatto sempre molto bene non conosco la mentlit di spalletti non so se come faccio io dir che non ha bisogno dei giocatori che non possono giocare ma questa la mia filosofia prima delle gare pi importanti non so se totti giocher ma posso dire che mi piace come calciatore sono daccordo nel dire che loro hanno giocato molto bene lanno scorso ma la storia del calcio quella dei titoli e lo scudetto rimasto a milano perch linter ha vinto in coppa italia e supercoppa hanno vinto loro domani queste due squadre ora un p diverse si riaffrontano e ci sar una squadra che ha vinto due titoli contro una che ne ha vinto uno pi importante dobbiamo rispettare i nostri avversari non averne paura il giorno che avremo paura di qualcuno meglio iniziare a giocare nel giardino con i propri figli
7088301 la cosa non mi preoccupa perch ho giocato a carte scoperte come a poker quando le carte sono tutte in tavola ho detto ad alcuni miei giocatori che avrei piacere se qualcuno avesse la possibilit di scegliere il proprio futuro le carte sono in tavola tu e tu fuori dalla champions league tu e tu avete poche possibilit di giocare se restate una vostra decisione ma non bussate alla porta del mio ufficio per chiedermi il motivo per cui giocate poco io con una o due settimane di anticipo dalla chiusura del mercato ho spiegato a tutti quale era la situazione per me non un problema se tutti decidono di restare restano tutti giocatori dellinter tra laltro lavorano tutti molto bene non un problema per me averli in gruppo sono opzioni in pi e rispetto i contratti tra i giocatori e il mio club
7088302 ndr sorride prima di tutto credo che il chelsea debba fare un dvd di questa partita e venderlo nei negozi di londra cos come ci sono tanti dvd delle partite passate ad esempio chelsea barcelona 4 2 in champions league un dvd che ha venduto migliaia di copie forse meglio sostituire questa partita con il dvd di chelsea portsmouth laltra cosa positiva che ora posso andare a londra con tranquillit prima per me era impossibile vista la passione dei tifosi ora positivo perch sono pi tranquillo

7088306 the major political parties first gave credentials to bloggers in 2004 the republicans allowed a dozen bloggers to attend their convention in new york while the democrats gave bloggers 35 seats in the nosebleed section of the fleet center in boston this year the r n c gave credentials to 200 bloggers as a means to get senator mccains message out to more people said joanna burgos the press secretary of the convention for bloggers attending the democratic convention at the pepsi center in denver two types of credentials are offered the first is a national credential which offers the same access granted to members of traditional news media organizations the second more coveted credential is the state blogger credential it allows one blogger per state to cover the convention alongside its state delegation with unlimited floor access
7088307 as a result of changes the made to the u s farm bill this year the record keeping requirements are much less onerous than what would have been the case under the 2002 farm bill and there certainly is much more accommodation of existing market chains or value chains
7088308 they are allowing the americans to put product from label a into label b
7088309 although the rule is apparently a little more flexible than the previous one its very similar to what was introduced several years ago everything filters down from the retail level
7088310 its effect on the canadian market place will be decided by retailers and u s packing plants and their ability to efficiently comply with the rule while at the same time utilizing canadian product
7088311 until we get clear interpretations from usda on some of the key regulatory elements its difficult to tell what the commercial implication will be
7088312 in this day and age being able to access food products from around the world is absolutely essential we strongly oppose any barriers to trade that prevent us from sourcing the best products possible for consumers
7088313 were looking at issues such as whether usda is going to require the countries to be identified in a certain order or a certain order for some products and a different order for other types of products were looking at the impacts on the distribution system as well whether for example the warehouses will need to keep products segregated by country of origin or whether theyll be able to mix them in the distribution centre
7088314 u s retailers are as varied as the consumer groups that they serve
7088315 each one is going to have to assess the regulatory impact of the new requirements and figure out how best to continue to provide high quality food products to consumers efficiently some may very well decide to limit sourcing for some items such as produce or particular meat items others will look at the volume of product that they are committed to providing to consumers and decide that single sourcing just isnt an option
7088316 pork that goes into processing is not subject to cool nor is pork used in food service or pork that is exported from the u s so we would be looking at maximizing opportunities to have the pork considered as processed i think an area there could include pork which is marinated or other enhancements to the product right now those may not be considered as constituting processing but well be arguing they should
7088317 retailers have the primary burden under the law we are the ones who are required to provide country of origin information but we cant look at a hand of bananas or a pork chop and know what the origin of those products are

7088330 the local newspaper buffalo news has a tendency to listen to the downstate people and if you listen to them they are going to criticize us all the time one of the reasons i have an opponent has to do with the fact they want to get rid of me because i am too pro upstate new york
7088331 it is bizarre that dale volker apparently thinks that i or perhaps even konst or pawarski are running at the behest of the buffalo news

7088417 the ones in baghdad and diyala province just changed their t shirts there are large numbers who were really al qaeda we have to really look hard for those elements without blood on their hands
7088418 we want to have our cake and eat it too support maliki and the sons of iraq maliki wants to make that as hard for us as possible he wants us to choose him
7088419 what it looks like we are getting is a maliki government that wont behave itself and wants to crush the sons of iraq
7088420 just last week the prime minister gave his personal commitment to the program
7088421 they are well aware of the sacrifices the sons of iraq have made that they were a critical element in bringing the security situation under control and that it is in their strategic advantage to assimilate them peacefully and orderly into iraqi society
7088422 our goal is that by june 2009 the sons of iraq are out of business
7088423 we have the same problems around the country we cant just create a program to pay some people and not others
7088424 if the government of iraq doesnt decide to employ all of them you have jobless rates that skyrocket
7088425 we dont have a get out of jail free card for the sons of iraq there is law and order in this country and we respect the iraqi government
7088426 in the event that the u s military and government dont live up to their promises it could turn back to a violent form of resistance

7088458 we are blessed by the fact that our friend and neighbor is also our number one supplier of foreign oil

7088460 if american mayors want to send their money to unstable undemocratic countries in the middle east instead of to canada that will be their call if they want to pay a premium for iranian saudi iraqi oil that will be their call
7088461 do you think americans are going to be paying a buck or a buck fifty more because somebody said that our carbon footprint is higher than oil from kazakhstan
7088462 you have to consider the environmental impact in a broader context
7088463 there is significant economic benefit from the development of oil sands the oil sands represent a very secure reliable long term source of supply to the united states people in the u s will have to judge whether that supply stacks up to other alternatives
7088464 they say no no were going to do research and really clean up our act well you cant give these guys permission to go ahead on the promise that something is going to happen in the future
7088465 for 40 years a couple of oil companies worked on the tar sands extraction process not its environmental impacts it was albertas massive expansion of tar sands leasing over the last few years ignoring serious unanswered environmental and public health concerns that created this mushrooming crisis

7088545 i dont know much about biden but ive heard he has move international experience
7088546 its probably a wise choice because thats one of the areas where obama is perceived as weakest
7088547 hes also argumentative which is a good thing for someone in the second position it takes some pressure off the presidential candidate
7088548 when youre running you try to find something that you have that no one else has
7088549 now that hes part of the ticket that will change
7088550 they are both intellectual and will be able to put together sentences that neither mccain nor whoever he picks as a running mate could never put together
7088551 i love biden he was my second choice for the democratic nominee
7088552 he has good international experience and a long record he puts a lot of weight into the campaign
7088553 he has been an outstanding senator and would have been a good presidential candidate
7088554 i think a woman not necessarily hillary would have been a better choice
7088555 i dont know that much about bidens record and i think thats important when making a choice because obama has said he would rely heavily on the people around him as president
7088556 i dont know yet whether he was a good choice for obama
7088557 until we hear more its hard to say whether he will help or hurt obama
7088558 theres no evidence it has happened and no evidence it will happen
7088559 soon in order to upgrade relations between the two countries
7088560 that barack obama selected joe biden as his running mate is wholly consistent with his lack of experience and judgment
7088561 joe biden is hardly an agent of change he has been a lifelong politician in washington

7088588 para cuando la actual crisis alimentaria puede convertirse en perpetua
7088589 creo que el momento es correcto podemos evitar una crisis como socios trabajando juntos

7088632 well the modern church isnt going to change at this point so ill just stick it out and not challenge that status quo
7088633 moreover i gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them that they might know i am the lord that sanctify them and hallow my sabbaths and they shall be a sign between me and you that you may know that i am the lord you god
7088634 well the modern church isnt going to change at this point so ill just stick it out and not challenge that status quo
7088635 for i bear witness that according to their ability yes and beyond their ability they were freely willing imploring us with much urgency that we would receive the gift and the fellowship of ministering to the saints
7088636 i was even told that i was taken off of praise and worship because i was not drawing people in and i was the reason they did not come to church
7088637 how can you hate your brother that you see and love god who you not see
7088638 now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them
7088639 and every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my names sake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life

7088651 when i was leaving for macedonia i asked you to stay on in ephesus and warn certain people there to stop spreading their false teachings you needed to warn them to stop wasting their time on senseless stories and endless lists of ancestors such things only cause arguments they dont help anyone to do gods work that can only be done by faith you must teach people to have genuine love as well as a good conscience and true faith there are some who have given up these for nothing but empty talk they want to be teachers of the law of moses but they dont know what they are talking about even though they think they do we know that the law is good if it is used in the right way

7088658 arent you exploiting thousands of american deaths in both this current war and 9 11 just sell a book
7088659 that is my greatest consolation as we speak many people including veterans are purchasing this book witnessing the very references which prove this books biblical promises people are witnessing biblical prophecies as they unfold before their eyes concerning 9 11 and iraq freed by a modern eagle amazon com just announced upon their web sight that they have sold out the book and must now order more
7088660 there are no unsatisfied customers who complain having not received any thing less than was promised by the author
7088661 there are steady reports of people who find far more than what they expected possible it would be unforgivable for any author to promise people such to exploit a national tragedy just for book sales
7088662 i have four children of my own if my book were to become exposed as a manipulation of biblical text such would forever mark my childrens name as well as my own
7088663 reading this particular book has made me aware of how christians have come to accept biblical spin and less than honest interpretations when reading books on bible prophecy
7088664 bible prophecies of 9 11 the whole idea of 9 11 and iraq being in bible prophecy admittedly was quite appealing to me
7088665 the more she suffered the more we attacked the enemy right up until she went home i just wouldnt quit

7088668 my daughter dying is the worst career move the devil could have made were going after 100 million souls and he will pay
7088669 were believing for 150 000 souls to come to christ
7088670 i believe that the harvest will be three times that amount
7088671 i dont know if you know there was an angel in the room
7088672 why would i want to go down there when you guys are coming up here soon
7088673 youre going to have people raised from the dead watching tbn
7088674 and i see them bringing them closer to the tv set
7088675 your going to see my created hand created miracles arms growing out legs growing out amputated limbs where there have been no limbs will begin to grow out jesus told me he said he gave us all power and authority over work of darkness
7088676 eyeballs will form legs and arms will grow out people will leap out of wheelchairs
7088677 everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again but whoever drinks the water i give him will never thirst indeed the water i give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life
7088678 i thought my comments would be removed from the website in regards to it being private i just read on the other page that you dont do personal prophecies anymore would have appreciated if you had taken my 1 down and then just told me that your schedule doesnt allow you too any longer i see that you do respond to other people and my feelings are hurt
7088679 turn right at the next corner and go two blocks and besides that corner is where we want off
7088680 no one will ever be able to do that to me again
7088681 if i had not done the miracles then you would have an excuse for your unbelief but because i did the miracles i thereby proved who i was and so you have no excuse for your unbelief
7088682 faith without works ie the works of the kingdom is dead
7088683 these works shall you do miracle works of the kingdom of god and greater works than these shall you do because i go to the father
7088684 the people already believe in jesus they dont have a problem believing in jesus but they dont believe in the supernatural they dont believe in the angels or the prophetic etc
7088685 to lay off preaching jesus or that it wasnt all about jesus rather that the church already believed in jesus but they did not believe in the supernatural
7088686 exceeding and abundantly far more than we can ever ask or think
7088687 the works that i do shall you do also and even greater works than these shall you do because i go to the father
7088688 these things are written that you may believe and that though believing you may have life in his name
7088689 if anyone shall deny that the body and blood together with the soul and divinity of our lord jesus christ and therefore entire christ are truly really and substantially contained in the sacrament of the most holy eucharist and shall say that he is only in it as a sign or in a figure let him be accursed
7088690 if anyone shall say that the substance of the bread and wine remains in the sacrament of the most holy eucharist together with the body and blood of our lord jesus christ let him be accursed
7088691 if anyone shall say that christ the only begotten son of god is not to be adored in the holy sacrament of the eucharist even with the open worship of latria and therefore not to be venerated with any peculiar festal celebrity not to be solemnly carried about in processions according to the praiseworthy and universal rites and customs of the holy church and that he is not to be publicly set before the people to be adored and that his adorers are idolators let him be accursed
7088692 this is the rock i will build my church on

7088730 jump head first into any river touting god as its source sans any spiritual discernment whatsoever i fear for many people who may do likewise when it comes to this florida
7088731 why were gods people taken into captivity first in egypt and then in babylon
7088732 why were christians allowed to be put to death simply for proclaiming the lordship of jesus in their lives
7088733 why did god allow 250 000 ordinary people to die in the tsunami
7088734 discernment and distinguishing of the spirits is the least wanted or valued gift in the church it is never preached on in any of the charismatic pentecostal circles i have been in
7088735 maybe just another of the long list of angry souls wanting to fight and beat anybody who has an anointing from god a fighter of the spirit give me a brake read acts 50 times for penance and come back to pentecost and laugh in the spirit pray in tongues prophecy with real apostles and we can talk

7088737 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive

7088743 cry out cry out to the most high god for surely your idols have fallen every one and no more shall they rise
7088744 and now i shall establish in this place my golden gate a gate of repentance a gate of revival a gate of cleansing a gate of holiness
7088745 if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy meditate on these things
7088746 since deciding to reject this doctrine in my own heart i have become more in love with the lord as he has taught me the true nature of himself and i am free to receive his truth because i am no longer trying to line it up with a teaching that makes no sense
7088747 the heart of the doctrine of the atonement that is the idea that god sent his son as a substitutionary sacrifice and that the son bore the wrath of god in our place and the father representing the interests of the trinity saw the suffering of christ and was satisfied

7088750 the fatal shortcoing of modalism is the fact that it must deny the personal relationships within the trinity that appear in so many places in scripture or it must affirm that these were simply an illusion and not real thus it must deny three separate persons at the baptism of jesus where the father speaks from heaven and the spirit decends on jesus like a dove and it must say that all those instances where jesus is praying to the father are an illusion or a charade the idea of the son or the holy spirit interceding for us before god the father is lost
7088751 the fatal shortcoing of modalism is the fact that it must deny the personal relationships within the trinity that appear in so many places in scripture

7088757 you are always emphasizing that you do everything by the book but here is the situation no one aside from the members of your division in fact should know the contents of your ponencia decision and here you are delivering a copy of your decision to a justice who is not a member of your division what is the point only for her reading
7088758 justice vidal was in my decision when we issued the tro
7088759 no longer a member of your division there was no more need to show to her a copy of your ponencia and yet you are showing to her a copy of your ponencia only for her reading pleasure
7088760 why did you not send also a copy of your ponencia to justice sabio for his reading pleasure also i know he also likes to read

7088762 it is a violation of the law for lawyers to follow up cases at the office of the justices they should respect the privacy of records of the case

7088769 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage

7088774 it had become the culture in his neighborhood to visit igor to get your bike
7088775 it was gods way of saying its time to put a stop to this
7088776 he made a lot of money off it judging by where he was living
7088777 the public reaction is a bit extreme and knee jerk
7088778 you just get pulled completely in when you start talking to him
7088779 with the changing neighborhood i knew that it would culminate in igor being pushed out im just shocked at the number of bikes and storage facilities and the quantity of drugs is just ridiculous

7088788 competen exclusivamente a la comisi n investigadora el poder determinar
7088789 es una comisi n que acaba de iniciar su trabajo as que lo tenemos que respetar y darles el tiempo para que comiencen a describir lo que ha pasado
7088790 tenemos que entender que en un proceso tan complejo como es un accidente a reo las cosas no ocurren tan deprisa como uno quisiera es un proceso que tiene que tomar tiempo cada accidente es nico y se compone de cuestiones que no se repiten en otros accidentes no hay informaci n que se va generando cada a minuto
7088791 es el nico que tiene la capacidad de decidir sobre lo que ocurre a bordo del avi n tanto si se puede bajar como si no
7088792 con ello no quiero insinuar que la responsabilidad fue del comandante en alg n aspecto que pudo fallar sino que su facultad es la de evaluar la situaci n en cada vuelo

7088808 true ultralights dont need faa airworthiness certificates and you dont need a pilots license to fly one
7088809 because we do not certify these things we do not investigate these crashes
7088810 its popular there and every once in a while one of them crashes
7088811 i dont know much about biden but ive heard he has move international experience
7088812 its probably a wise choice because thats one of the areas where obama is perceived as weakest
7088813 hes also argumentative which is a good thing for someone in the second position it takes some pressure off the presidential candidate
7088814 when youre running you try to find something that you have that no one else has
7088815 now that hes part of the ticket that will change
7088816 they are both intellectual and will be able to put together sentences that neither mccain nor whoever he picks as a running mate could never put together
7088817 i love biden he was my second choice for the democratic nominee
7088818 he has good international experience and a long record he puts a lot of weight into the campaign
7088819 he has been an outstanding senator and would have been a good presidential candidate
7088820 i think a woman not necessarily hillary would have been a better choice
7088821 i dont know that much about bidens record and i think thats important when making a choice because obama has said he would rely heavily on the people around him as president
7088822 i dont know yet whether he was a good choice for obama
7088823 until we hear more its hard to say whether he will help or hurt obama
7088824 theres no evidence it has happened and no evidence it will happen

7088848 but this is the first summer in which we havent made progress
7088849 ive not brought in good players to help them on
7088850 i would have thought it has done it no harm we want michael to stay all of us we just want to reach an agreement for all parties he wants to stay he really likes it here
7088851 michael was on the bench and he said give me a long warm up i gave him 20 seconds and he went on and scored he did what he does better than anyone in the world
7088852 we have thrown it away we missed a penalty and defended badly from a set piece it is frustrating disappointing and it is an angry dressing room at worst we should have at least got a point
7088853 i was pleased with the first 10 or 15 minutes then it was a little bit ugly and we were not playing well in the second half they scored a good goal and were on top of us
7088854 but in the end we showed a winning mentality and it sends a positive message to the fans we know steve is not 100 per cent fit but he showed his quality to win the game
7088855 im heartbroken for the lads they are incredibly down in there but ive got to look at the bigger picture weve given two good performances against two top teams and thats given me a lot of belief and the players have got to believe they didnt deserve the blow they got at the end ive told them they leave with their heads held high
7088856 after a series of frantic phone calls during the day today we have reached an agreement with chelsea
7088857 andriy returns to the rossoneri tomorrow he will be in milan monday he will undergo a medical then he will sign a contract and from tuesday he will be available to carlo ancelotti
7088858 we succeeded in bringing home the player who in the last 50 years has scored the most goals in our shirt president silvio berlusconi and i am happy as is our coach and i believe also our players
7088859 i believe that milan are the only club in the world to have three european players of the year in our squad
7088860 andriy has returned home and i am happy about it i am a milan fan and i am very happy ive spoken to andriy 48 times in the past three hours the terms of the agreement are very private
7088861 between today and tomorrow andriy will be at milan and he will start again his life as a milan player
7088862 the players are desperate to play at this level and its vital that we win our home games
7088863 theres a terrific spirit about the place and that will take us a long way
7088864 its a special place when the supporters respond like that
7088865 and they can be so important to us this season they really do lift the players

7089008 hey our vehicle is so safe it has curtain airbags
7089009 holden has once again brought the australian car industry to new heights with introduction of run flat tyres
7089010 hey holden have a 2 star car ford obviously doesnt otherwise he would have mentioned it
7089011 ford also has vehicles in its range that score less than the perfect five stars
7089012 yet nothing as dismal as the 2 star holden barina
7089013 ford also has vehicles in its range that score less than the perfect five stars
7089014 bones and joe ive read somewhere that the toyota corolla will get esp vsc as they call it at the end of this year that will mean that all their new cars above corolla will have it standard or optional not including commercial vehicles
7089015 think about putting your family into a death trap its not worth risking it just because it looks better or it drives faster
7089016 renault comes to mind and there are definately some affordable cars in their range this would force companies such as holden and ford to not only match the bare minimum of safety standards that ancap tests for but rather actively move forward in the world of automotive safety
7089017 give me an accident in a corolla vs a elants or getz anyday when it comes to the impact corolla will save getz eleantra will not
7089018 learn to drive ffs vsc esp dsc are all stupidity controls
7089019 but if you are franging a car like a yaris barina getz maz2 etc to such an extreme that you need it then get off the road
7089020 and yes i have avoided accidents due to these controls in both toyotas and holdens and its pretty cool technology but if you are franging a car like a yaris barina getz maz2 etc to such an extreme that you need it then get off the road

7089028 lets all move from already reasonably expensive outer areas closer too the city where prices are easily triple or more increase our mortgages two fold at a minimum and work even more hours again just too save a few bucks on fuel
7089029 hey we cant see the sense in spending on infrastructure in the burbs as everyone is moving to the cbd
7089030 the authors of the report say those who do keep driving will switch to diesel or hybrid cars while four wheel drive sales will eventually fall

7089042 what s your view of american cars do you love them or hate them or do you wish the yanks would get the germans to engineer their cars and the japanese to build them
7089043 more important is ride quality an area in which the voyager shines ironing out potholes and undulations with aplomb
7089044 the car oversteers becuase this is what it did when we drove it
7089045 id be surprised if theres not a superior japanese car in almost every segment in which a french car competes
7089046 which was nearly identical it was only then that i realised just how the game worked i do not buy car magazines and the only journo that i t
7089047 which was nearly identical it was only then that i realised just how the game worked i do not buy car magazines and the only journo that i trust is bob jennings
7089048 is it better quality than the other one i drove
7089049 id be surprised if theres not a superior japanese car in almost every segment in which a french car competes

7089051 now i m sure the purists will howl me down here and call me soft but performance isn t the be all and end all of a hot hatch or sedan in the evo s case besides the audi s3 is still impressively quick
7089052 in the presence of the mighty xr6 turbo and f6 these cars have become irrlevant posted by sash august 15 2008 9 57 pm
7089053 do you agree with the verdict or do you think performance should be the number one criterion for a test of this kind
7089054 hey sam its funny how the upper end of society has driven up the prices of those working class muscle cars those all noise v8s due to their individuality and rarity these people are the ones i call greedy cocks who have to get their grubby hands where it doesnt belong they should just stick to their bland euro luxo mobiles and their bland shallow lifestyles cocks
7089055 it s3 is better at providing boy racer thrills than the japanese pair is at delivering euro luxury
7089056 how long do you leave the chips in the fryer for a mchappy deal
7089057 my next car will hopefully be an audi s3 sportback when it arrives
7089058 im not a fan of the styling at the rear of the 3 door s3 and a 5 door will suit my purpose better even if it is a tenth slower to 100km h
7089059 hey good try mate i left your boy racer in its wake because of my great refinement and comfort and check out my classy leather everywhere
7089060 i have never heard anywhere else saying mitsubishi wants to take the fight to euro hot hatches
7089061 a second hand lime green wrx with 20 inch wheels doof doof music blaring and fluffy dice hanging from the rear vision mirror is not a great ad for the brand
7089062 but casey i dont care when the game is on ive got a dvr what i want to know is how many former trail blazers have olympic medals
7089063 personally id rather see an open market where we the consumer drive the market
7089064 do or die for ford it was a non event
7089065 ford is pointless overpriced uneconomical garbage coming from expensive inefficient unionised labour
7089066 just off the fpv blogs guys are getting around 285rwkw as std from their new fg f6s
7089067 if you really care about national pride made things that are better than them not to protect what you are having now
7089068 open road the issue is that ford holden were never australian in the first place they only opened production facilities in australia at the time because it is the most profitable thing to do from the companies perceptive
7089069 it is not necessary to change survival is not mandatory
7089070 common misconceptions that todays commodores and falcons are lumbering or are dinosaurs are complete bollocks
7089071 i say good riddance to the sheltered workshops in broadmeadowss and geelong and bring on a true free market where innovation quality and meeting consumer demand take the place of churning out half hearted designs poor quality and under engineered chassis re bodied ever couple of years to make them look fresh
7089072 first imported cars tarriffs exist to protect the local manufacturing and related industries
7089073 local product is protected to maintain employment and for a whole pile of other domestic economic reasons it is protected becauase it would not survive in an open market
7089074 locally ford and gmh are trying to survive with a very low domestic turn over of vehicles due to our population base put simply australia does not offer the economies of scale in manufacture that larger countries can therefore the product is more expensive to make
7089075 it would also be highly likely that gmus pontiac division might be carrying the manufacturing cost for gmh thus subsidising the whole deal just so they can get a competative product into the us at a cheap price
7089076 im no expert but economies of scale and difficult export markets are two reasons why making car in australia is pretty damn hard
7089077 no one in their right mind in an elite suburb would be seen dead in a ford
7089078 he looked more relaxed in the second half of the race
7089079 noisy brakes and the vehicle pulling to left or right run into any kerbs recently
7089080 when did being linked too toyota in lexuss case become a bad thing
7089081 japan keep trying and trying but they cannot consistently match the quality of european cars
7089082 lexuss performance in these studies is nothing short of phenomenal the car maker has topped this survey for 14 years in a row and improved again this year
7089083 alfa your best friend on the road your worst enemy off it
7089084 alfalfa looks and tastes unique you know its good for you but when you do you just end up with a bitter taste in your mouth
7089085 so much for the truth about the world class and value for money assertions about the australian product made by all too many uninformed contributors to this site
7089086 what the evidence clearly suggests is look elsewhere and look long and hard at a japanese or korean car before making a choice
7089087 hey rat patrol your examples of supposedly cretin value of the survey could be the result of basic reliability problems like the demister not working or brake problems or the seat adjuster missing
7089088 people here are arguing like japan are a mini europe lets get this straight japan keep trying and trying but they cannot consistently match the quality of european cars
7089089 its no faster in a straight line than my naturally aspirated 4 cylinder yet costs twice as much
7089090 that the problems are identified by owners during the initial ownership period but have not been rectified by automakers during the three year ownership period
7089091 my point was to let the jap euro fans know that gm does build quality vehicles
7089092 the survey looks at two areas of customer dissatisfaction quality of design and defects or malfunctions
7089093 the 25 000 price difference for us made it relativly easy to decide and the significant extra fuel efficiency of the merc is a nice bonus especially these days
7089094 anyone who thinks the value of a car is determined by its straight line performance needs to go back to reading hot4s not a motoring blog
7089095 why dont we see these chevrolet monte carlo in australia
7089096 or many years general motors has built nothing but awful poor quality unreliable hacks and certainly amoung the worst cars to have ever graced the road
7089097 this is lexus its not your toyota or holden it all comes as part of the package
7089098 the survey looks at two areas of customer dissatisfaction quality of design and defects or malfunctions
7089099 you cant really compare the is250 to the sv6 or xr6 or sx6 zr6 for that matter even if you dont care about rwd for one you dont get the same levels of quality
7089100 reducing customer dissatisfaction with design elements of their new car is a bigger challenge particularly with the array of new technology such as navigation systems and entertainment devices
7089101 i believe they do a good job provide a wothwhile and notable service service and have long demonstrated integrity in thier field
7089102 do i research to indentify trends over a period of time from different groups absolutely
7089103 i believe they do a good job provide a wothwhile and notable service service and have long demonstrated integrity in thier field
7089104 eight areas were put under the microscope mechanical problems interior problems exterior problems vehicle performance vehicle interior vehicle exterior the quality of service from dealers and ownership costs in each area owners rated their cars which gave an overall customer satisfaction index csi score the overall result is drawn from these eight areas weighted in favour of quality and reliability then vehicle appeal dealer service and finally the cost of ownership
7089105 what worthwhile endevours is rat patrol and motu held in high regards for
7089106 if gm had kept up with technology like the computer industry has we would all be driving 25 00 cars that got 1 000 miles to the gallon
7089107 wind energy and streetcars get a lot of tax credits in the u s
7089108 if we have a level playing field we can compete with anybody in the world
7089109 most notably sen biden has a strong record of opposing judicial nominees with hostile anti choice records he voted against george w bushs two anti choice nominees to the
7089110 in addition sen biden has a strong record in opposition to anti choice clinic violence and voted to hold anti choice extremists convicted of violent attacks against doctors and patients at womens reproductive health centers accountable for their criminal actions
7089111 sen biden who is a cosponsor of the landmark prevention first act also has joined us in supporting commonsense efforts to prevent unintended pregnancy by improving womens access to birth control ensuring teens receive accurate sex education and supporting family planning programs
7089112 the founder of holland and the founder of hope college was the same person theres a long historic connection with the college and the community
7089113 when you think about it hope college really anchors one corner of our downtown area wit its campus and provides a lot of attractive facilities and stability to our downtown area

7089122 she couldnt understand why everyone is talking about that swimmer
7089123 she couldnt come up with michael phelps name and then she yammered on about how she was the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth and how that was the big story right now not the swimmer
7089124 she couldnt understand why everyone is talking about that swimmer
7089125 its a dog eat dot competition no doubt and ill be gone like you wishing and im out cause i aint got time for hanging around when you f king my love in all the wrong placeessss
7089126 ich suche ein buch es ist im gro en und ganzen rechteckig und rosa
7089127 irgendwas mit sex oder h hepunkt oder mit bett aber das m ssen sie doch wissen sie arbeiten doch hier

7089129 das kann ich ihnen nicht so genau sagen es ist eine windows version
7089130 you can never win a war against terror as long as there are conditions in the world that make people desperate poverty disease ignorance et cetera
7089131 i think people are beginning to realize that you cant have pockets of prosperity in one part of the world and huge deserts of poverty and deprivation and think that you can have a stable and secure world
7089132 i heard them saying today that the expansion is not directed against russia but its the potential not intentions that matters
7089133 the progress of human existence and not simply the propagation of democracy
7089134 former us president george h bush talked about a new world order then lost to bill clinton and what happened then well nothing happened then the americans cried victory and walked off the field
7089135 by doing so the us failed to learn one of the lessons of history that the victor should be magnanimous with the vanquished
7089136 this posture automatically carries with it the possibility of a russian nuclear attack by mistake
7089137 this means that while the cold war is over the risk of a mistaken pre emptory nuclear response has increased
7089138 the old west then complains about vladimir putin being a poorly disguised russian autocrat and nationalist when the west has played a large role in creating him
7089139 a truly representative structure of world governance which reflects global realities but which is also equitable and fair
7089140 for two clinton presidential terms and two george w bush terms the world has been left without such a structure certainly one able to accommodate russia and the great states like china and india
7089141 where germany and japan were left on the outside and still are 60 years later and in which china and india are tolerated and palely humoured
7089142 he thought being an american acolyte was all that was required
7089143 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
7089144 like a lot of teachers there now i figured how bad could it be i was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005
7089145 i became very very sick my immune system shut down i collapsed and was bedridden for several months
7089146 i wouldnt have kids in the school if i didnt think it was safe i would close the school
7089147 i do think there are areas of that school that continue to be dangerous
7089148 you can go most anyplace and build a school on top of a superfund site
7089149 they can build a school anywhere they want really and thats the sad truth i think at schools very little has changed and thats unfortunate
7089150 the children would actually pick up these chemicals and handle them
7089151 so for example one of these things was phosphorous rocks phosphorous rocks were little pieces of chemical residue that would bubble up to the surface the children would pick up these phosphorous rocks and when you threw them at a hard surface they would explode like a firecracker
7089152 orang orang yang makan mengambil riba tidak dapat berdiri melainkan seperti berdirinya orang yang kemasukan setan lantaran tekanan penyakit gila keadaan mereka yang demikian itu adalah disebabkan mereka berkata berpendapat sesungguhnya jual beli itu sama dengan riba padahal allah telah menghalalkan jual beli dan mengharamkan riba orang orang yang telah sampai kepadanya larangan dari rabbnya lalu terus berhenti dari mengambil riba maka baginya apa yang telah diambilnya dahulu sebelum datang larangan dan urusannya terserah kepada allah orang yang mengulangi mengambil riba maka orang itu adalah penghuni penghuni neraka mereka kekal di dalamnya

7089156 in lisbon they were trying to correct it in an unintelligible drivel
7089157 during the summer of 2006 there were no attacks on ships at all
7089158 we could start to see scenes similar to the 1992
7089159 it might be simple to say we know where they are

7089165 dear vnc why the hell are your shoes so fugly now
7089166 be ready to spend an entire day at said market
7089167 we should not believe arms sales will be a replacement for the hard diplomatic slog weve got to go through in the region in order to not only stabilize iraq but to make sure iran and syria and other countries that historically have been hostile to us arent getting stronger
7089168 identifying evaluating and monitoring social political and environmental trends issues and concerns
7089169 analyzing how public policy trends could impact business activities and performance
7089170 dumping controlled waste at illegal unsuitable sites can harm the environment
7089171 unknown contaminants and chemicals from waste could leak through soils damaging nearby watercourses and harming wildlife
7089172 operators acting illegally for financial gain threaten the livelihoods of legitimate waste collectors who run their businesses in line with waste regulations
7089173 give the power back to americans by saying no forever to the money and influence of lobbyists
7089174 trade agreements should be good for main street not just wall street
7089175 a presidents role is to create jobs not export jobs it is a distinct lack of presidential leadership to ask mexico and canada to help fix things
7089176 it is a very big mistake to telegraph the world with what wed do pakistan has nuclear weapons when musharraf is gone his replacements will have these weapons think big but dont tell everyone what you think
7089177 i did not say wed go into pakistan unilaterally i said we should work with musharraf to fix the borders between pakistan and afghanistan americans have the right to know about this debate not just washingtons insiders
7089178 that are just hard working americans like you and me
7089179 it appears the chinese economy might not be the muscle toned high spirited stallion of an economy nipping at the ankle and eager to over take the over burden
7089180 exxon mobils perspective a decent comment as posted as far back as september of 05 by the houston chronicles blog

7089186 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
7089187 they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
7089188 a major final push will be needed to close the gaps but with the right spirit there is now a deal on the table to be seized
7089189 the papers reveal just how much significant progress has already been achieved and that the remaining gaps can be specified to achieve results even though the topics are contentious

7089208 the first thing is to get the carbon pollution reduction scheme right and weve released a detailed green paper on that and we are consulting business as we speak and the community sector and that will take some time
7089209 the important principle for us is to make sure there are no barriers to linking the schemes and based on my advice there are none frankly in terms of the long term health of the planet i think it is a good direction to head in but as i said in terms of our processes we still have a way togo
7089210 anyone who thinks that coal and coal related technologies are marginal to the debate or so inherently unclean that we should kiss it goodbye i dont think is addressing the chinese reality

7089231 were looking for these boys to now become professionals that means the right attitude towards training and everything they do ive told all the boys to look at the olympics and see how dedicated the athletes are getting into our first team is like training to win a gold medal and over the next few years the boys really have to concentrate on that goal theres a long way to go but theyve all shown great potential so far
7089232 nicky has been with us in the academy for a long time he is a very exciting player and has the ability to beat defenders with his pace or skill he is very quick whether he is running with or without the ball nicky can make things happen in and around the goal hes creative and is capable of making or scoring goals
7089233 robert is an exciting player hes very quick and he is a good all round player robert can play in either position left wing or upfront he is good in the air and he can make goals and score them he has good pace which allows him to recover well getting back into position to win the ball back
7089234 reece will obviously forever be saddled with the tag of being wes browns younger brother when people see reece they see a striking resemblance both in terms of looks and style of play he has the same sort of attributes hes good in the air quick and hes a big lad reece has settled in nicely hes been at the club since a very young age but the start he has made to his professional career has been really good he has concentrated right from the start which is a feature we really wanted him to look at
7089235 conor is a good young goalkeeper we took conor over to the milk cup tournament in northern ireland in july and he did very well for us hes an irish youth international goalkeeper and he has impressed us so far he reads the game well and he is ready to be part of the team and the back five
7089236 joshua looks like hes going to be a very good athlete he is tall strong and a very powerful player hes a strong runner with or without the ball and he can beat defenders he is another player who has made a good start to his under 18s career
7089237 davide is an all round midfield player he does a bit of everything he can win the ball distribute it well hes got a good range of creative passing and he has a hell of a shot on him he likes to shoot as well and he has the potential to score plenty of goals from midfield either with a long range shot or bursting into the box to score with his feet or from a header
7089238 hes a very reliable central defender reliability is something you always want from a defender scott tends to do the right things and is a good decision maker on the pitch
7089239 he gets into the right positions and has a good understanding of safety and risk he looks like hes got good potential to be a good talker and a leader which you need at the back hes made a good start and a good impression

7089247 i will be seeing my specialist within the week i appreciate all the concern from all my family friends and fans
7089248 in opinia noastra activitatea economica a atins un varf in al doilea trimestru si ne asteptam sa se tempereze in urmatoarele trimestre
7089249 decelerarea activitatii ar trebui sa fie reflectata in special in rate mai scazute de crestere ale pib excluzand agricultura politica monetara mai restrictiva si incetinirea activitatii economice din zona euro sunt principalii factori care vor determina aceasta decelerare
7089250 the biggest mistake i made was coming up with a rebuttal
7089251 my philosophy had always been to keep quiet and not to say anything and by me responding that drew me into it if i had to do it over again i wouldve just let people talk and say what they had to say and as time goes on they wouldve seen what was what
7089252 i stayed to watch them get their gold medals just to see what that would be like
7089253 whose whole job whole purpose is to just stay on top of my health
7089254 people here have seen my personality more than in the states ive done tours here in the season im in that mamba mode that switch is on but during the summer im kicking back and they get to see what a smart ass i am they get a chance to relate to you a lot more
7089255 half the places you go to in the states theyre rooting against you here i think theyve seen more of who i am
7089256 as i get older i do care what people think of me
7089257 i dont want them to have the wrong impression that is important to me im not too big to say that im not embarrassed to say that
7089258 he really hasnt been himself so were going to give him a couple starts down in triple a just to see if he can get his mechanics back together
7089259 weve got some chance to catch these guys and we want to put the best possible group out there we can right now
7089260 thats the kind of way we were used to playing last year that was something we needed to see
7089261 that gives us a little confidence with the season around the corner
7089262 i tried to bait the guy a little bit but he did a great job and got underneath the ball
7089263 it was nice to see him regroup after the interception
7089264 to come out of the two minute situation with points is a positive that gave us a shot in the arm
7089265 we could have done a ton more we didnt go that deep in the playbook as long as we get into the rhythm and feel good about each other and what were doing the skys the limit
7089266 well probably start looking at cleveland probably more in depth now and start preparing for them
7089267 everything offensively went well passing game the run game just the way we moved the ball down the field
7089268 we had five foot waves with white caps constantly beat us to death i was bouncing up and down like a ping pong ball
7089269 she done her number on us believe me ive been on the boat for three years and this was the first i was scared i was scared we all were
7089270 i lost everything i lost my wallet i lost everything i had my keys my teeth everything
7089271 i said were going to treat it just like somebody sprained his ankle the week before we played
7089272 brandon is going to play a lot of games for us this season
7089273 the deep ball and press coverage and thats what i worked on hard this offseason before i hurt my arm i told jay that if we improve that in our game deep ball and press coverage were going to be pretty tough
7089274 he understands coverages kind of like i do and we got a good feel when hes going to be 1 on 1 were going to take some shots if thats going to be the case
7089275 i mean if they want to press him up and start jamming him and play nobody over the top thats what youre going to get youre going to get some deep balls with us hes hard to stop
7089276 i could not kick at all i could not hang on
7089277 what i did for over seven months can be destroyed in three weeks
7089278 we hear about climate change as a political issue an environmental issue and an economic issue we want to press the point that this is a moral issue
7089279 the crops die farmers then have to plough and plant again
7089280 it is not moral for some people to go to bed with a full stomach when others go to bed with their stomach empty
7089281 rivers are drying out where we get water and fish
7089282 the walk to collect water is increasing as wells dry up
7089283 it is very easy to forget the human dimension there are people today whose lives are being disrupted by climate change
7089284 this is a moral issue in the sense that rising emissions in rich countries should not lead to rising poverty in others

7089293 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7089294 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7089295 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent
7089296 thats where we are today in the middle of a financial crisis with the economy sliding into recession with monetary policy at maximum easing and fiscal transfers impotent
7089297 more than a year into the most challenging financial crisis of our times we now face a complex and interlocking combination of rising inflation declining growth tightening credit conditions and widespread liquidity tensions
7089298 these adjustments will not be painless and ensuring that they take place in an orderly manner will pose substantial challenges for policymakers

7089331 the government is claiming it has completed all preparations for holding the parliamentary polls then what is their problem in holding the polls in october or november
7089332 the people will think that the government is involved in conspiracy against the long awaited parliamentary elections
7089333 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be

7089339 the corporation is already suffering from a fund crisis and it has become difficult to pay even the salaries of regular staff under the circumstances when the authorities were planning to downsize the sudden fresh move for permanent recruitment has utterly disappointed us
7089340 the move is a conspiracy a certain quarter is trying to make things difficult for me ahead of my induction to the office at the same time some are planning to make some quick bucks from the recruitment process
7089341 their permanent recruitment has been stalling for the last several years
7089342 tarique rahmans health condition is deteriorating fast hes almost partially paralysed now

7089346 it is a token protest we are observing the day as a black day as part of the protest
7089347 i urge those who deem dhaka university as their opponent not to bear such thoughts in their mind as students and teachers of the university do not consider anyone as their opponent
7089348 i urge the dgfi to say they want to achieve a reconciliation with the teachers and students of dhaka university
7089349 they should be given the chance to study in a peaceful environment

7089351 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
7089352 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
7089353 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
7089354 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
7089355 i sold the largest hilsa of this season weighing 1 5kg at tk 1 000 per piece on friday
7089356 at this time last year the same size hilsa sold at tk 500 600 per piece as the supply was adequate
7089357 at this time last year i supplied around 2 500 3 000 pieces of hilsa every day but this year i cannot even bring 1 000 pieces
7089358 mr asif zardari has accepted to contest the election for the office of president of pakistan after the party unanimously drafted him to do so
7089359 the coalition partners were informed about this decision and we are optimistic that the coalition will remain intact
7089360 i have no objection over mr zardari contesting presidential election if he removes the 17th amendment
7089361 the agreement says that next president will be after removing 17th amendment the ppp will have a right to nominate its own president then
7089362 zardari thanked pakistan peoples party of which he is the co chairman and said he will announce his decision within the next 24 hours
7089363 people also will have to take a stand that they will not to resort to corruption nor allow anyone to do corruption
7089364 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7089365 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realising that barack obama is not ready to be president
7089366 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbour instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7089367 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7089368 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7089369 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7089370 about 90km more rainwater drainage lines are needed at different areas of the city to strengthen the drainage system the width of the existing pipes should also be increased
7089371 wasa becomes alert about the drains clogging in the rainy season and starts cleaning them but it needs to unclog the drains during the dry season
7089372 we try to manually clean the drains as much as possible
7089373 we are trying to buy modern drain cleaning equipment in the hope of improving the situation
7089374 we are going to take up a 150 million project financed by world bank and when implemented most of the important areas of dhaka will come under the wasa drainage system and 13 canals will be developed
7089375 i had gone to bangladesh recently it concept of micro financing and self help groups is a huge success there with workers saying they can win nobel prize for their efforts in this direction

7089381 homeopathy is an alternative medicine system that tries to treat illnesses with tiny doses of the drugs that cause the same symptom as the illness homeopathy is based on the ideas of samuel hahnemann a 19th century physician who observed that some contemporary medicines evoked symptoms similar to those of the illnesses for which they were prescribed there is no clear evidence to support the efficacy of homeopathic remedies and it is likely that the reported effects are placebo effects
7089382 its like sitting on your back porch and driving your house
7089383 their projected rates of expansion are so fast that we dont have a hope in hell of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
7089384 we are blessed by the fact that our friend and neighbor is also our number one supplier of foreign oil
7089385 the amount of energy that you have to use to get that oil out of the ground is such that it actually creates a much greater impact on climate change as well as using much more energy than even traditional petroleum
7089386 if american mayors want to send their money to unstable undemocratic countries in the middle east instead of to canada that will be their call if they want to pay a premium for iranian saudi iraqi oil that will be their call
7089387 do you think americans are going to be paying a buck or a buck fifty more because somebody said that our carbon footprint is higher than oil from kazakhstan
7089388 you have to consider the environmental impact in a broader context
7089389 there is significant economic benefit from the development of oil sands the oil sands represent a very secure reliable long term source of supply to the united states people in the u s will have to judge whether that supply stacks up to other alternatives
7089390 they say no no were going to do research and really clean up our act well you cant give these guys permission to go ahead on the promise that something is going to happen in the future
7089391 for 40 years a couple of oil companies worked on the tar sands extraction process not its environmental impacts it was albertas massive expansion of tar sands leasing over the last few years ignoring serious unanswered environmental and public health concerns that created this mushrooming crisis
7089392 it would be the equivalent of several hundred exxon valdez oil spills
7089393 im just one of a chorus of people that are concerned
7089394 seventy six people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred during the operation by coalition forces in shindand district of herat province
7089395 does he carry that thing around every where he goes
7089396 that was impolite i meant to say shut the f up please
7089397 no one let us down really but we didnt flow as well as we should have introducing shaun helped in that department
7089398 he was alright but theres better than him his goals give me something to think about
7089399 i thought lets find out what the fans really feel about it there was a huge roar everyone at the club is excited
7089400 james vaughan turned the game and made all the difference because he ran about and gave us an extra forward that we have not had
7089401 after training yesterday i felt i had no choice but to bring him in the party and he probably won us the game and that is what we are missing
7089402 we hung in and we got something in the end but coming here with the team weve got is difficult would i have taken a 2 1 win with any team yes and with the team i put out today i definitely would have
7089403 we can be happy with the game but not the result
7089404 we brought it on ourselves against bielefeld we twice took the lead and couldnt keep it
7089405 well have to work on that but we have taken a step forward today
7089406 when you take a point from a game like todays then you have to be happy
7089407 we played against a very good side that are creative and offensive the goal we conceded was a defensive error
7089408 i am immensely proud it would be easy to highlight mistakes which led to the second goal but they have given absolutely everything
7089409 they have given a good account of themselves against one of the top teams in the country and i have said they have got to leave here with their heads held high
7089410 they have got to take belief after that performance as we pushed liverpool all the way and we would have been disappointed to come off the field with a point the way the game went we have to take the result on the chin and we will come back stronger
7089411 we have goalscorers in the team we had to be organised defensively and they have worked their socks off and stuck to their plan of keeping their shape as you cant go gung ho at a place like liverpool
7089412 we need to learn form the last ten minutes but i am not going to be critical as they were fantastic
7089413 un partido serio de noventa minutos y en el que los jugadores que formen nuestra defensa y centro del campo ser n los titulares frente al bolonia en la primera jornada de liga
7089414 ich war berrascht dass wir nicht ruhig am ball waren und keine sicherheit hatten
7089415 aber man muss auch sagen dass es ein spiel gegen einen guten gegner war
7089416 gut fu ball gespielt haben wir auch schon letzte woche
7089417 aber heute waren wir etwas konsequenter bei der chancenauswertung und auch im defensiverhalten

7089421 40 response rate which is on the low side of whats possible
7089422 we start every series well we always win the first game and then we mess the next four up
7089423 the key to tonights win is to make sure we focus on tuesday and turn up with the same energy and same buzz i am captain who wants my players to be confident and play without fear and do a proper decent job thats what i do all my life i have been doing that and i think it is rubbing off on some of the lads
7089424 things are working at the moment and it is down to the way the guys have reacted over the last two weeks it was a real turn up for the books that michael did what he did but that was right for michael
7089425 but it is hats off to the lads they have shown such energy and passion the dressing room is such a happy place and that is because we are winning
7089426 there are areas we need to work on and there are some real positives happening in english cricket at the moment
7089427 i could not have asked for more from steve my relationship with him is as strong as anything and he is a happy happy man he is a superstar as well this is the stage he belongs on
7089428 steve wants to play for england and play on the bigger stage and that is where he is performing at the moment

7089489 her fear of black men who passed by her on the street

7089492 generally shunned the tent revival circuit preferring a straight backed form of methodism that valued reason over passion and temperance over both
7089493 blanched whenever someone mentioned the subject and hoped to carry the secret to her grave

7089501 here you graduated from college so you should be able to figure out this file
7089502 i was young and just graduated and thought i could kill the world
7089503 she really put me straight she made a point of indicating that experience is equitable to going to college and she was right
7089504 never stopped dreaming of a house with a white picket fence days spent baking or playing bridge or volunteering at the local library
7089505 your grandfather and i just figured we should treat people decently bar
7089506 shes wise that way my grandmother suspicious of overwrought sentiments or overblown claims content with common sense
7089507 before you came in she told me the fella was black thats the real reason why shes bothered
7089508 never had they given me reason to doubt their love i doubted if they ever would
7089509 and yet i knew that men who might easily have been my brothers could still inspire their rawest fears
7089510 than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe
7089511 she was really a very liberal person liberal in politics and i think liberal in thinking
7089512 frankly that story when it was in the book i felt didnt need to be in there
7089513 from our grandmother he gets his pragmatism his levelheadedness his ability to stay centered in the eye of the storm

7089516 every effort is made to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives
7089517 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor
7089518 reviewing the terms of that contract and other contracts with pa consulting
7089519 i am shocked by the level of expenditure on consultants and even more shocked by the way the government seems to have become dependent on consultants for the delivery of core public services
7089520 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20bn id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco
7089521 this will destroy any confidence the public still have in this white elephant and reinforce why it could endanger rather than strengthen our security
7089522 frankly the keystone cops would do a better job running the home office and keeping our data safe than this government and if this government cannot keep the data of thousands of guilty people safe why on earth should we give them the data of millions of innocent people in an id card database
7089523 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels

7089530 under the circumstances it is difficult to avoid the impression that the cia and other intelligence agencies defended themselves against the dangers of attack from the bush administration through a process of self censorship

7089548 so what you want to try and do when you get really good and this really is an advanced thing you need to know when to do tricks when to get boost when not to
7089549 if you really want to go clear over maybe bumpy ground or three or four jumps to land on a downramp you want to boost jump
7089550 but then youve actually got to think about sequences of corners and youve got to think of the bumps and jumps in the track like theyre corners youve got the two dimensional left and right but also youve got the distance to deal with which kind of adds an extra dimension to the racing so youve kind of got a three dimensional racing line

7089577 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake

7089579 cutting off support that will save the lives of thousands of american troops
7089580 and look tim if you tell me ive got to take away this protection for these kids in order to win the election some things arent worth it some things are worth losing over that would be worth losing over hundreds of lives are being saved and will be saved by us sending these vehicles over which we are funding with this supplemental legislation and i want to ask any of my other colleagues would they in fact vote to cut off the money for those troops to protect them thats the right question this isnt cutting off the war this is cutting off support that will save the lives of thousands of american troops
7089581 i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7089582 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of each of those countries within the first year i was elected president absolutely positively no
7089583 a nd im told senator obama announced today senator lantos sic and i wrote into law the requirement that the aid to pakistan be conditioned upon their support of us going after al qaeda in their western province it already is a law the question the way to deal with it is not to announce it is to do it the last thing you want to do is telegraph to the folks in pakistan that were about to violate quote their sovereignty putting musharraf in a position that makes it virtually impossible for him to do anything other than what hes done basically cut a deal with the warlords along that border to our great detriment so its not something you talk about
7089584 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan much of what senator obama has proposed senator biden has already initiated or accomplished
7089585 biden campaign congratulates sen obama for johnny come lately position
7089586 saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the united states or to his neighbors
7089587 s addam poses no imminent and direct threat to the united states or to his neighbors that the iraqi economy is in shambles that the iraqi military a fraction of its former strength and that in concert with the international community he can be contained until in the way of all petty dictators he falls away into the dustbin of history
7089588 helped to authorize and engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation
7089589 well look i find it amusing that those who helped to authorize and engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation are now criticizing me for making sure that we are on the right battlefield and not the wrong battlefield in the war against terrorism
7089590 this is a guy whos used weapons of mass destruction this is a guy whos destabilized the whole neighborhood this is a guy who in a war with the iranians over 800 000 people on both sides were killed this is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world and this is a guy who is in every way possible seeking weapons of mass destruction that case in and of itself ought to be sufficient
7089591 if the president of the united states was saying four years ago clear evidence of mass destruction do we have any choice but to eliminate saddam hussein and the threat
7089592 i still believe that saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction
7089593 i still believe that saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction and that the war in iraq was justified
7089594 statement of senator joe biden on the white houses acknowledgment that iraq uranium assertion was wrong
7089595 i mean look the president had a choice and it was a tough choice when he came when 9 11 occurred he could either listen to the advice colin powell and shinseki and most of the uniformed military and john mccain as well and dick lugar and others or choose the advice of the vice president secretary of state the secretary of defense and others and he chose the wrong advice and this i think we need a fresh start to be able to gain any momentum on this war on terror and i dont think were going to see any change id feel a lot better if i knew that president bush was going to be elected and im not being solicitous if i knew he was going to start to listen to john mccain instead of the secretary of defense because they have totally different no i shouldnt say totally many have very different views of how to proceed and so i think youd see a difference in the way how you prosecute the war in iraq i think youd see a difference in how you dealt with homeland security and i think youd see a difference in terms of the cooperation with other nations in terms of getting the consensus on how to deal with controlling chemical biological nuclear weapons
7089596 and so ive believed for a long time a view shared by my republican colleague john mccain and many others as well that we need more force in iraq thats not a popular position to take but we need more force now in order to have less force later we need to gain control of security in iraq
7089597 you may end up going against a senate colleague perhaps mccain perhaps frist
7089598 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7089599 sen joe biden of delaware a former presidential candidate and longtime senator he could help obama with perceived shortcomings on experience especially with foreign policy
7089600 what americans are looking for is not washington experience but do you have life experience that is gonna lead you to make good decisions
7089601 i do think that increasingly what americans are looking for is not washington experience but do you have life experience that is gonna lead you to make good decisions and are you in touch with whats happening on the ground
7089602 what i was drawing on in dealing with iraq was a set of experiences that come from a life of living overseas having family overseas being able to see the world through the eyes of people outside our borders
7089603 obama better judgment on foreign policy abcnews go com 7 25 07
7089604 and i have to remind them when i hear this you know dick cheney and donald rumsfeld had two of the longest resumes in washington they did and led us into the worst foreign policy disaster in a generation so long resumes dont guarantee good judgment
7089605 obamas n h swing the clinton brand human rights growing up in a muslim country
7089606 the sort of general notion of experience based on longevity in washington i dont think is sufficient to make the case to the voters of iowa or the american people
7089607 you should keep on doing the same things with the same people over and over again and somehow expect a different outcome and thats the definition of madness
7089608 what washington is really telling you is that you should keep on doing the same things with the same people over and over again and somehow expect a different outcome and thats the definition of madness doing the same things over and over again and expecting something different
7089609 the idea is to maintain a unified iraq by decentralizing it and giving kurds shiites and sunnis their own regions the central government would be responsible for common interests like border security and the distribution of oil revenues it would require a regional non aggression pact overseen by the u n security council and it would allow us to responsibly withdraw most u s forces from iraq by the end of 2007
7089610 his broader proposal calls for a political solution that would provide regional autonomy for shiites sunnis and kurds and guarantees by the central government that sunnis would share in the countrys oil revenues
7089611 prince turki told a conference on washingtons relations with the arab world that dividing iraq into three regions reflecting its shiite sunni and kurdish populations would be a disaster
7089612 to envision that you can divide iraq into three parts is to envision ethnic cleansing on a massive scale sectarian killing on a massive scale and uprooting of families
7089613 many middle east experts are horrified by the difficulty of dividing the nation
7089614 you talk too much and you say things without thinking about them norman ornstein a friend and admirer told the senator as he was gearing up for his candidacy i know ive got to be more disciplined biden replied
7089615 he has a tendency to over explain that doesnt inure to his political benefit acknowledges larry rasky who will be communications director for bidens presidential campaign
7089616 i think this is a last ditch effort to go out and rape the offshore continental shelf so that they own it and are able to use it as leverage in the future because they know if they dont get it in the last couple of months of this administration theyre not going to get it biden said
7089617 a s a candidate for the 1988 democratic presidential nomination biden withdrew from the race in 1987 amid accusations that he had plagiarized passages in a campaign speech from former british labor party leader neil kinnock
7089618 kinnock told of ancestors who played football after long days underground in the mines who recited poetry and paved the way for him to become the first in his family to attend college when he saw a tape of kinnock in action biden said it was a connect i mean i could tell how that man felt thats how i feel so he used it changing the names but little else at a debate last month in iowa
7089619 bidens way with words now seems to be a liability

7089732 i just got on with my life i thought about cancelling the big brother india trip but they had offered me 100 000 approx usd 200 000 which will go towards bringing up my kids people think im a multi millionaire from telly which couldnt be further from the truth
7089733 since big brother my life has been fashioned by publicity but no way would i want anyone to be in my shoes now i have to try and brush that sort of stuff aside and concentrate on living and getting well again
7089734 it was a fantastic finish its always important to win but to win in this way with the passion and commitment of the players is much better
7089735 last season we were drawing these games this season we havent played really well but weve won two games and have six points
7089736 its good to look over my shoulder and see a scoring option like cisse on the bench
7089737 hes got good presence and pace when that cross came in sometimes its written in the stars
7089738 i think i got the maximum out of the car and the best time we could do and in the end we are only 1 3s from the fastest time of the session
7089739 it just shows how close everything is now but i dont think we could have done anything more
7089740 it was a fantastic effort from the team and the car felt good
7089741 it could be an unpredictable race tomorrow so lets see how it goes
7089742 on the last run i had some problems with the traffic on my out lap and couldnt warm up the tyres so they werent ready for the first couple of corners so i locked up in the first corner
7089743 thats why i couldnt improve my lap time which was disappointing as the final run is always the quickest and i couldnt improve my time
7089744 i think a good effort from the team and giancarlo got the maximum out of the car in qualifying
7089745 its the first race with our quick shift box and i think we have clearly taken a step forward in competitiveness and its nice to start outqualifying some of the works cars in the process

7089748 the booing was perfectly understandable because we are the world champions and we cannot afford to lose two in a row its unacceptable to play like that
7089749 it was all about execution because the chances were there but we cannot make mistakes like we did today its unacceptable for any international player it was not good enough and unfortunately those mistakes killed us
7089750 its not nice being booed but the crowd is unhappy rightfully so they have every right to be unhappy
7089751 they want to back a winning side but we never go out there to lose on purpose and its a new playing style im trying to get out there rome wasnt built in a day and i ask the people to be patient to give us more time
7089752 youve got to be happy with that the performance was by no means error free but it was never going to be with south africa such a desperate team but the intensity was there the boys got up and did what had to be done the hard way they gutsed it out it was not straightforward and im very happy with the composure
7089753 the boys got up and met the physicality of the springboks they did huge work and it was a good effort

7089757 the determining factor was that j t had the better command said nolan he played with consistency and we moved the ball well as a unit we scored points and he did the things that are important for that position

7089830 the ones in baghdad and diyala province just changed their t shirts there are large numbers who were really al qaeda we have to really look hard for those elements without blood on their hands
7089831 we want to have our cake and eat it too support maliki and the sons of iraq maliki wants to make that as hard for us as possible he wants us to choose him
7089832 what it looks like we are getting is a maliki government that wont behave itself and wants to crush the sons of iraq
7089833 just last week the prime minister gave his personal commitment to the program
7089834 they are well aware of the sacrifices the sons of iraq have made that they were a critical element in bringing the security situation under control and that it is in their strategic advantage to assimilate them peacefully and orderly into iraqi society
7089835 our goal is that by june 2009 the sons of iraq are out of business
7089836 we have the same problems around the country we cant just create a program to pay some people and not others
7089837 if the government of iraq doesnt decide to employ all of them you have jobless rates that skyrocket
7089838 we dont have a get out of jail free card for the sons of iraq there is law and order in this country and we respect the iraqi government
7089839 in the event that the u s military and government dont live up to their promises it could turn back to a violent form of resistance
7089840 we have to get rid of the iranian influence in iraq and rebuild the democratic state
7089841 definitely he will go to the resistance he will go back to violence
7089842 we feel this is a political game to embarrass and expel us
7089843 we are just dealing with the matter because we have no choice
7089844 we dont know what our stance will be if other things happen from the security forces the iraqi government or the americans
7089845 the americans have made their compromises they want the iraqi central government authority to prevail so they can withdraw to their bases
7089846 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade

7089858 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7089859 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7089860 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7089861 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7089862 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7089863 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7089864 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7089865 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7089866 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7089867 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7089868 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7089869 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7089870 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7089871 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7089872 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7089873 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7089874 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7089875 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7089876 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7089877 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie

7089897 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras

7089909 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7089910 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

7089918 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7089919 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7089920 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

7089925 you spy on americans for me and ill make sure you dont have to pay any taxes
7089926 just remember four things when you go into the voting booth this november 1 barack hussein
7089927 whats that say make the buttons bigger 20 times bigger
7089928 youre trying to tell time on a seiko why not buy a breitling
7089929 it has been a blessing for me to be out on this court
7089930 i havent necessarily played great during this tournament tonight i got into some foul trouble as did diana taurasi and katie smith but we fought hard and we beat australia
7089931 het is gewoon iets om de mensen te doen lachen men moet er vooral geen verheerlijking van de doodstraf in zien
7089932 after a series of frantic phone calls during the day today we have reached an agreement with chelsea
7089933 andriy returns to the rossoneri tomorrow he will be in milan monday he will undergo a medical then he will sign a contract and from tuesday he will be available to carlo ancelotti
7089934 we succeeded in bringing home the player who in the last 50 years has scored the most goals in our shirt
7089935 president silvio berlusconi and i am happy as is our coach and i believe also our players
7089936 i believe that milan are the only club in the world to have three european players of the year in our squad
7089937 andriy has returned home and i am happy about it i am a milan fan and i am very happy
7089938 ive spoken to andriy 48 times in the past three hours the terms of the agreement are very private
7089939 between today and tomorrow andriy will be at milan and he will start again his life as a milan player
7089940 andriy made a mistake in leaving and i believe that in the past two years he has realised that this is his home
7089941 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7089942 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7089943 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7089944 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
7089945 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7089946 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7089947 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7089948 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
7089949 we couldnt and we havent found any identification showing they are taliban
7089950 the coalition forces have made mistakes so many times and killed so many civilians we are asking president karzai to come here
7089951 on such a serious allegation as this one we have to look into it
7089952 were just trying to get to the bottom of this
7089953 what aggressors us we are just protecting the motherlands citizens
7089954 vast mighty and feared and to pave the way to world domination
7089955 russia has only two reliable allies its army and navy
7089956 georgia will be a member of nato it wants to be one
7089957 its been a blessing for me to be out on this court
7089958 i havent necessarily played great during this tournament tonight i got into some foul trouble as did diana taurasi and katie smith but we fought hard and beat australia its the third olympics in a row weve faced them for the gold for all those kids out there i encourage you to write down all your goals
7089959 you look at the shooting and that tells a story
7089960 we were down in the 20s percent you cant win ball games like that so credit goes to them
7089961 this summer i was determined to leave with a gold
7089962 of course i was disappointed with the 400m but i said i wasnt going to leave here without a gold
7089963 i never expected to beat blanka because for almost one year shes been unbeatable
7089964 but its always nice to be at your best at big championships
7089965 we gave a recommendation this does not mean it will be a final decision
7089966 the wtf will look into it as to what legal actions can be taken
7089967 it is a most unfortunate situation it is an insult to olympism and insult to the spirit of taekwondo and an insult to mankind
7089968 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7089969 this is outstanding when we came here we didnt think about the gold medal
7089970 our goal was third place but every game we gave 200 percent
7089971 we fought hard and i think that its a good medal
7089972 our bats woke up brett pitched a great ball game
7089973 weve been working very hard for the last four years
7089974 we are a very bonded team each and every player of the team deserved this gold
7089975 its not about who is better its about preparing well and coming here to play
7089976 brazil is amazing they did a great job in blocking there were indeed differences between us
7089977 i hope our country is celebrating back home it was a beautiful day from the start
7089978 im a little disappointed because we couldve created history for us and nigeria
7089979 but im so proud we won the silver ill be honest nobody gave us support we were here on our own as a team we had to pull together as a team and fight for one another
7089980 being named the us flag bearer for the closing ceremony is almost like winning a gold medal maybe even better
7089981 i thought i could win a gold medal in competition but i never thought id have this opportunity i am truly truly so proud to be an american citizen and part of the u s olympic team
7089982 i think its great to get the silver and i won it in a fair way
7089983 but its not my place to judge her blonska i just wanted to get on the medal stand i didnt know where it would be im very happy with the silver
7089984 my cheeks hurt from smiling my face hurts from the chlorine my legs are sore from jumping up and down
7089985 im in pain and im tired but im so happy
7089986 the last dive was not as good as i could have done because i started to get nervous
7089987 im still young and i have a chance to do better in the future
7089988 the support from england the phone hasnt stopped ringing and it helped it truly helped
7089989 this verdict is unfair i have won the bout i have won it
7089990 but in order to do so we had to be prepared from the first second to the last and thats what we did
7089991 i think this is a testament to my good fortune as i have not dealt with failure before
7089992 in the last 24 hours i have certainly been dealing with it
7089993 what can i say it has been eight years at the top it wasnt going to last forever
7089994 we were striving for it together to be higher than everybody
7089995 it was really difficult but we are all really happy
7089996 this kind of thing has happened before she is a very nervous athlete she is back to consciousness
7089997 i was very happy because from the beginning i could make the race at the front and set the speed i thought the polish rider would have been stronger after the first downhill i saw i could pass her and take the lead
7089998 when you ride your bike at the olympic games you cant play safe
7089999 its not a question of riding a careful race you dont think you just go because if you dont if you lose its four years of regrets
